77076,"My idea of &#34;gardening&#34; is to have lots of hanging baskets and container plants on my patio to enjoy.  This soil is perfect for that,and it is fairly lightweight, which I like as hauling it into the backyard when it was delivered was not near the problem Ithot it might be. It is a LARGE bag of soil.  I have ordered 3 bags of this and so far, all my container plants seem to begrowing well, my hanging basket plants are doing well, and in another two weeks or so, should be looking perfect andfull of flowers!  It is nice I could get this delivered as I have no car, and therefore, have a real problem getting plants and soilhome to use in the spring."
77077,"It's actually sleek looking and although I didn't have the nerve to actually stick this to my guitar, it's a lot easier to find this in my guitar bag or even in my room than a few stray picks here and there. It holds about 8 medium size picks for me and I'm sure I'll lose a lot less picks because of it! It's almost kind of fun putting my pick in this thing..is that weird to say? Just buy it already!"
77078,"I'm very claustrophobic, so I couldn't help but imagine how I'd react to being stuck in a mudslide.  I don't think I could have kept up the good humor for as long as this guy did, if at all.  I've got to admire him for channeling his inner MacGyver to try to think up ways to get water/breathe/keep the mud out of the car/figure out how much mud he was buried under, using the tools and objects in his car, and finally working up his courage in a last-ditch attempt to dig himself out.  This role required some damn good acting on the part of Neil Hopkins (whoever he is) to keep up the viewer's interest (the flashbacks helped too) for almost 90 minutes, and I think the film accomplished that fairly well."
77079,"The beans I purchased and planted were destroyed from the root by opossums after numerous trees in our area were destroyed so I can't tell you if this would have worked because I never got to use it for my beans, cucumbers and other veggies.  I'll be back to update this next Summer (2014)."
77080,This is a very amusing comedy great mix of politics and court room drama with a ton of funny experiences.  The character mix in this show is phenomenal. Keagan is always getting into some crazy escapade. You wont be disappointed.
77081,"When I watched the pilot for the series, I was not sure that I would like this, but I was missing Inspector Lewis.  However, during series one I became more interested.  I had not seen many of the original MORSE episodes, but rented them through Amazon Prime (wish they would sell the episodes rather than rent).  Then I started looking for connections between the two - a fun bit of detective work !  This series 2 so far seems to be developing very well.  The characters of Jakes and Bright seem to be rounding out to less of just anti-Endeavour characters.  Inspector Thursday is still my favorite character and episode 3 gave us more background for him.  It is also nice the see Morse's relationship with his neighbor develop - the only drawback being that having seen the MORSE series we know that nothing permanent will happen.  Still, it is good to have the Morse family of shows continue.  I still wish we could find out what Sgt. Hathaway went on to do.  Maybe PBS could at least make a follow up LEWIS movie to update us on Lewis, Dr. Hobson and Hathaway.For other Kevin Whatley fans out there - look for BROKER'S MAN series and the final episode of season 5 of GEORGE  GENTLY - quite a plot twist !I hope that they can continue this series, I would like to see PC Strange's character given more scope considering the tie in to the MORSE series.Update:  I just watched episode 4 - WHAT A CLIFFHANGER !!!!!  Now we have to wait HOW LONG for the next episode ?????  Please hurry up with the next season"
77082,"""What I wouldn't give to have tired of you.""  After a party makes her feel uneasy Joanna (Knightley) thinks that her husband Michael (Worthington) is cheating on her.  The next day he leaves on a business trip, with the women (Eva Mendes).  The same day Joanna runs into her past love and spends time with him.  Both are tempted to do what they shouldn't.  This is a movie that you have to let form.  The first half hour or so is a little slow, but then it really starts to take shape and the ending will leave you wanting more.  Being a man, this is not usually the type of movie that I enjoy, but I really did like this one.  I would call this a more subdued version of ""Closer"", much less overt sex and much more subtle love.  Much like ""Closer"" you are pulled back and forth between who you like and who you don't.  Who is right and who is wrong. Who you want to root for, and who you shouldn't.  Either way this is a very emotionally powerful movie that will leave you wishing there was more.  Overall, I surprisingly liked this movie a lot. This is a very emotional movie that will leave you thinking.  That's a good thing.  I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I actually think I might."
77083,"My 1996 F150 started to stall - especially when running the AC.  I picked up this kit on a gold box special to see if it would help.  Best few bucks I have spent in a while.  First, I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and parked the truck with the nose down in my driveway.  Big help with clean up.  Followed the directions and everything is running much smoother.  Of note, the F150 has two throttle bodies so I split the first can between the two.  With the gold box deal and the rebate I am one happy camper."
77084,I do my own pool care and the filter gets most of the stuff but this is good for getting rocks off the bottom of the pool etc.
77085,"i was increasingly satisfied with this show in season one but expected it to go downhill in season two.  i have been pleasantly surprised to be wrong.  if anything, it is better.  johnny lee miller, sherlock, has gone the extra mile to develop a very modern sherlock with the problems you would expect him to have if he lived present day. he can be obnoxious, insensitive, not in touch with his feelings, and so forth.  it is a very well nuanced delivery of sherlock.  in fact, i hate to say it, but i am enjoying this show more than the UK modern day one with bernard cumberbuch as sherlock (perhaps because there is nothing i like about his sherlock as a person). lucy liu is doing an equally good job developing dr. joan watson. plus their relationship is developing and interesting to watch.  these are also entirely new stories rather than an updating of the old stories.  aidan quinn as the police chief and the other supporting actors do a fine job in their roles and i am particularly liking the actor who is playing the brother to Sherlock.  i think he can be brought along nicely too. kudos to everyone for a job well done."
77086,"Amazingly clever and witty, Great Show! The cast is perfect together, the writing is refreshing to say the least, well done."
77087,"This season starts out exceptionally violent to the point where I wondered if people in Kentucky just use guns and kill each other including law enforcement. The primary enemy of this season is especially despicable and tiresome onscreen. The pregnant ex-wife of Raylan gets less screen time and Rylan gets to be with an owner of a bar and others while she stays with her sister. Still there are some entertaining episodes and the occasional humor can catch the viewer off guard. One episode is both exceptionally violent yet very well done. One of the stupider criminals in town is conned into thinking his kidneys have been removed and in order to get them back, he must rob as many places as he can to pay the criminal who took them. If he goes to the police, the criminal Staes he will destroy the kidneys. That is one disturbing episode and while well done, I felt was exceptionally sadistic. So far I am finding some things to like about this show but very dis appointed also. It makes me miss Deadwood which I know was violent too but made more sense but could be very poignant also. Justified is a combination of cable show wirh some loosely tied story and a network show where the episodes are more loosely tied together and the theme music opens and closes the show with repetitious regularity. I don't care for broadcast network shows and this aspect of Justified which turns me off so. I expect a little more depth in my shows than a smirking hero with a gun."
77088,"When I am well entertained and my interest is involved in what will happen next, it's a good program and worth continuing. I highly recommend for entertainment value. Good acting too."
77089,I bought this stand after trying two others that didn't work well. This one is very adjustable and stays put. I use this in my home studio and I can place it so it comes up right under my mic boom just off to the side of microphone so when you are doing a vocal you don't have to look down or move you head away from the mic. I'll be buying two more.
77090,"Bottom line: This is made by MTD and is very similar in terms of performance and features to other MTD brand gear (such as Yard Man, Bolens, Troy-Bilt, and several others). It offers decent homeowner-grade performance with the benefit of being attachment capable. Not heavy-duty enough for extensive use, and the bump head is very finicky.Full review: It&#8217;s getting tough to find something that isn't made by MTD these days. That&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing since they make some decent gear considering the price. (They also make some really poor stuff as well.)This is one of their decent efforts. The main issue with the Remington, much like everything made by MTD, is that it&#8217;s intended for light-duty use. It&#8217;s perfectly fine for they typical suburban yard, but if you have a couple of acres to deal with, need something for commercial use, or want something that will last for a couple of decades, look elsewhere (I&#8217;d suggest brands such as Stihl or Echo. A lot more money, but a lot more durable as well).Starting/running &#8211; fired up pretty quickly right out of the box. It comes with oil and uses a 40:1 ratio (again, typical of most MTD devices). I did have to adjust the idle so it would run smoothly at low RPMs, which is easy to do (outlined clearly in the manual). It has a spring loaded pull rope which I really like. I have that on my Troy-Bilt machines, and it&#8217;s a great feature for folks like me with back problems. Rather than have to do a sharp tug to get it started, you pull the rope in a smooth motion. There&#8217;s a spring that compresses when you pull, and then releases. It&#8217;s hard to explain but easy to use and a great feature for ease of starting. The downside is that when the spring breaks, it&#8217;s a major, major pain to fix.Power &#8211; This has a decent amount of power (25cc 2-cycle engine) for getting through tough weeds, provided you use good quality line. Although this is attachment-capable, it does not have enough power to effectively run things such as a tiller attachment. It&#8217;s fine for most other attachments.Attachments &#8211; This has the typical split boom setup and will take attachments made by MTD (and their related brands such as Craftsman). I tried it with attachments from Troy-Bilt and Craftsman (an edger and a straight shaft trimmer head) without any problems.Weight/Balance &#8211; Decent on both. The vibration was not too bad &#8211; on a par with others in this price range. The grip handle is hard plastic but reasonably comfortable.Controls &#8211; straightforward. The build quality on some, such as the choke lever, is not great, so some care is needed to ensure it does not break. I like that the on/off switch is on the shaft near the handle so it&#8217;s easy to get to.Bump head &#8211; horrible! I didn't have much faith that it would work well since every other MTD bump head I've tried has been poor. This was no exception &#8211; feeding is sporadic and the force needed to feed out line puts way too much stress on the drive shaft (e.g., you&#8217;ll end up cracking it when bumping the line). If you get this, toss the bump head and get a fixed line head. You can pick one up at a home center store for just a few bucks. Yes, you&#8217;ll need to manually put the line in, but it&#8217;s very simple and far more reliable than the bump feed. Plus, you can use better quality line, such as Gatorline, which cuts through weeds much better than the standard stuff.Tip: MTD machines hate ethanol in gas &#8211; it will kill the fuel lines. I add both Sta-Bil and Sea Foam to my gas, and that has worked great. Zero problems with fuel lines, and all my 2-cycle machines have started and run well over the years.This is a decent choice for light-duty use. It&#8217;s not one of those tools that you&#8217;ll be able to hand down to the grand kids, but it will get the job done for several years (provided that you maintain it and use additives in the gas). The split shaft allows you to use this for multiple jobs, such as edging, or replace the curved shaft with a straight shaft. In comparison to a Stihl or Echo it&#8217;s quite poor, but, for the price charged, it&#8217;s a pretty decent choice. 5 stars since it delivers a good level of performance for the price."
77091,Here is another show that breaks from the norm and sets out on a new and different path.  A cast of characters with special abilities that are drawn to the town of Haven.  Also includes a love triangle that doesn't get too gooey.  I highly recommend this show.  Maintains the high standards set by Season 1 & 2.
77092,I just installed 3 of these and they fit well and are well made. I am expecting them to hold up for years.
77093,"too violent.... more than other programs ... couldn't watch it... though for comparison, i found the killings on netflix gripping..."
77094,"Tight script.  Great acting.  Very impressive pilot.  So far I rank this with Breaking Bad.  Give me more, Amazon.  Thanks."
77095,This was one of the pilots that I knew that I would like.  However I was surprised that 12 minutes into the pilot I hadn't laughed and I wasn't interested nor invested into any of the characters.  It wasn't bad but no where near my expectations.
77096,"Engaging and over the top. Lots of fun to watch. While it may not be the real DC, it's definitely exciting."
77097,Extremely affordable all needs riding glasses. Exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend for others to purchase for any rider.
77098,"I have a 2007 RAV 4 V6 and change my own oil. This tool fits the cannister perfectly and makes installing a new filter cartridge and ""O"" rings a snap. You just need a common 3/8"" rachet driver to fit the hole. Worth every penny for this well made, accurate, quality product. If you have one of the 65 mm canister type filter housings, and change your own oil, you can't do better than this. Highly recommended."
77099,"To describe my impressions of the TH-2000-S versus my well-used Sennheiser HD-201s I chose a few favorite reference tracks that illustrate different instrumental timbres and production values:  I like to use recordings I know well so I can quickly detect varying emphasis in frequency response and clarity.Andres Segovia - `Variations on a Spanish Folk Tune - Narvaez' from `My Favorite Spanish Encores'.In my opinion one of the finest recordings of solo classical guitar I've ever heard, both for the performance and the sheer beauty of sound.  The distinguishing points of this opening piece are the bass notes that Segovia's arrangement of the original vihuela-texture really emphasize. For me there's a difference between bass presence and bass clarity: I'll gladly trade less `oomph' in the gut for the kind of definition the Tascam's bring out:  warm, well-defined, with a crisp and clear treble edge. The Sennheisers, while equally balanced, were far muddier and less defined at the low end with less presence and sparkle on top. They were also considerably quieter and this applies across the board - the TH-2000-S just puts out a lot more sound at similar volume settings.Jeff Beck `You Know What I Mean' from `Blow By Blow'.The George Martin production remains for me one of the most colorful instrumental electric guitar records ever made.  The clean separation and space in the mix between guitar, electric piano, clavinet, bass and drums is always a joy to hear on a good sound system. The TH-2000s again demonstrated more punch in the mids and bottom end than the Sennheisers and overall more presence. It's a 24-bit recording and this is the first time I can honestly say I hear the difference - like being there in the control room, seriously. There's a greyness to the Sennheisers that frankly never bothered me before, but after hearing the Tascam phones, I doubt I'll ever be satisfied with less again.Stravinsky Violin Concerto - Anne Sophie Mutter from `Mutter Modern'.The words I keep coming back to are `presence' and `clarity'. I can hear string attacks, counter voices in woodwinds and an increase in overall spaciousness with the TH-2000-S that I simply don't hear with the Sennheiser phones.As far as craftsmanship, the TH-2000-S weighs more than my other phones and much of that weight is in the band rather than the cups. The sliding cup adjustment is easy to move yet ratcheted to stay in place securely when removing the phones casually. The cup mounts are really well-designed and allow fine-grained 4-way rotation that guarantees a snug fit regardless of the size and shape of your head and ears. I like the balanced feel and snug fit on my admittedly large head. The 2-3"" cushion along the inside of the band and in particular the adds comfort.The cord is a hybrid - the 2-3' closest to the phones is flat 1/8"" diameter, well-insulated 'matte-finish' and flexible. Beyond that there's another foot of coiled wire that will comfortably expand another 3-4 feet.  I think it's a nice compromise that's probably biased towards most users sitting fairly close to an output jack - you can avoid having to deal with excess cord unless you need to.As we get older our hearing changes: for most people it's a decrease in high-frequency response but it also occur across the entire spectrum.  Simply listening louder isn't always the best solution and it can be a tremendous ear-opening experience to try a pair of better quality headphones. I'd encourage anyone excited by quality sound to experiment and these Tascam TH-2000-S are a good place to start."
77100,"So I rented this movie based on the fact that guy I met while on a business trip played the lead character.  I mean, how many times do you run into that???  So, based on those credentials alone, I rented the movie.  I've got to say, not half bad.  I've developed a taste for B-movies over the years and this has got to be one of the better ones.  Certainlly low budget, and some scenes are bad enough to make your cringe but I must say I was overall pleased.  I would actually rent this one again.  I knew I was in for a treat when the prologue crossed the 5 minute mark. With a &#34;setup&#34; that long, you know your movie is going to be full of HUGE plot holes.  Well...at least they recognized that fact and tried to fill them in for you!  Overall, great low budget flick.  Hats off to you Jay Laisne!"
77101,I replaced my schrade set due to the hanging hooks breaking off and I must say that these are heavy gauge and well made. They have hanging loops for usage on my grill and they are Weber so they match my grill.  They were a little pricey but the construction is very heavy and solid.
77102,"It seems the producers of this may be big fans of the Paranormal Activity series. It starts off slow, doesn't have the movie's title or any credits in the start (or anywhere except the end), and it feels rather standardized.You're immediately introduced to the trio of parapsychologists- a tech expert, the secretary (I'm sorry... ""gatekeeper""), and the head boss. And they're all in the age ranges and have the looks you would normally expect (with the exception of the tech expert having no glasses for someone who's good with computers).The place that's haunted also has some expected quirks, including the rather standard family- widowed father of a teen daughter and little son. And yes, the daughter hates her dad with a shocking passion while the little boy loves his dad with a passion.The strange happenings come upon rather slowly and, at first, mundanely. When they get revved up by a s&eacute;ance and a hippie-looking channeler, things really get crazy (at times, including a hurricane-force wind within a single room). But, frankly, though I hadn't seen this movie until last week, I do feel like it's too familiar. I feel like I've seen too many visual cousins of this film.There were a couple pretty good shock/jump moments that, though the slow timing/pacing hinted they were coming, still had a good jump factor in them.Then comes the story's twists. One dealing with the spirit of the mother (and why the father says a couple extremely crude things about her, even after his explanations, still leaves me blank in reasoning), and how the parapsychologists review the entire spectacle.Then the ending. After I listened to the whole opinion of the head parapsychologist, it took a bit of time for the last shot to have anything, so I knew there would be one last thing happening. Not only did it happen in a bizarre way, but, in relation to all the things discussed, it proved to be an ironic ending.All-in-all, I'm actually hoping they don't bother making a sequel."
77103,"Put full weight of my fifth wheel them with no problem, but you need two if you have a double axle. Lay them both down in the same direction and pull the trailer completely over the first one and onto the second. Be sue they are spaced the same distance as the wheel axles."
77104,"Well first off I had a heck of a time keeping this up on the pole.  I'd tighten screws one day, come out the next morning and the baffle would be down about 3 feet.  I finally figured out (I think anyway) that the local deer were pushing it down to get to the food, or else it was a raccoon or something fairly large.  I kept tightening those screws but no matter what it wouldn't stay up.  Second issue was that our squirrels learned to shinny up to the baffle - tilt it and then climb the rest of the way to the feeder.  It was sort of fun to watch the antics BUT didn't deter the squirrels so I sent it back.  Overall it was quite frustrating that once again something didn't help."
77105,"The people are amazing to watch as they travel down the road of buying a home.  It's always a shocker to see some of them try to wrap their minds around the process.  The realtors are vital, and trust is questioned....but really is fun to see it all happen!"
77106,"This is a comedy that is too slapstick for my taste. It's old and it shows its age with juvenile humor that is past its prime. Shirley Temple is one of the students of the teacher, not a main character. Watch it if you want to see Shirley as a tiny waif, but you've been warned."
77107,Julianne Moore is as good as always and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers turns in an excellent performance.  The plot was better than I expected and I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  The ending was a little clich&eacute;d but not really all that bad.
77108,Very easy to install.  They make the front of my red 2012 JK look awesome!  I would highly recommend to anyone!
77109,"Once again frontline takes a topic, that's been handled in 60 different ways and tries to convince you that they're doing something unique heroine is bad you will get addicted to it very easily and ruin your life. So now frontline tries to insert stories of collateral damage from Mr. brownstone my heart goes out to that girl and her family but couldn't you say using her stories entertainment is somewhat depressing I would not recommend this documentary for someone withdrawling from opium or any opium derivatives it will only make you feel worse and you don't need that at this juncture after two with three of these documentaries you've seen them all respectfully Johnny Irish"
77110,This wheel brush is great for cleaning wheels. Go figure! But seriously... I was previously using a sponge and this is worlds better.
77111,"I will definitely take a look-see at the ongoing episodes when they arrive in the Fall. Some of the writing could use tightening up but the concepts, whose suffered the most? game, the Google car, Weight Watchers and recovery, are creative and applicable to dealing with grief.  The idea that texting kills couldn't be more topical in this crazy culture.  Sadness with moments of liberating joy - good grief counseling from this program.  How these introduced topics will be furthered without becoming hackneyed - I'm curious!Since I cannot seem to review separate episodes, I wanted to add onto this one.  Episode 8, Videogame, Set, Match, is a real game changer in that Ryan finally looks outside of himself to genuinely help another person.  There is nothing smarmy, sentimental or prissy about his efforts as he feels his way through countless video games, hospital hi-jinks and false conversation starts with another member of the group.  It is genuinely funny."
77112,Best musical drama show I've watched in a long time. y the CD and listen to the music. The story is Great also. Hope Deacon get's a break soon he deserves one. ABC is know for cancelling good shows!!! So buy the DVD now before they decide to cancel the show and put the DVD out of print. It's happened before trust me. They prefer Revenge over Nashville. I men come on if you can't kill your enemies in four years that's pretty sad. Nashville has a hell of a lot more potential for a great long series than Revenge which they renewed and cancelled Nashville for season 3. so enjoy the music and story it' great.
77113,"Peat Pots.... not much to say.  Hold their shape well, and slowly disentegrate over time once planted.  Work great for transplants and plantings."
77114,"I have been mixing a heaping tablespoon of diatomaceous earth (food grade) into my morning coffee every morning for one full month.  I cannot say I have noticed any physical changes for the better.  I have not experienced any of the following that so many other people say they have experienced while using this product:No improvement in skin conditionNo loss or lightening of pigmented spotsNo improvement in joint functionsNo regrowth of eyebrow hairNo increase in energyNo regularity in BMNo improvement in tooth enamelNo passing of internal parasitesNo improvement in hair and nail growthNo weight lossThere is nothing that I can honestly say is a positive improvement to my health after taking DE for a month.  I'm not saying it won't help you in these areas since so many others have seen great improvements in their health,  but either I am super healthy already (which is definitely not the case) or it simply isn't doing me any particular good.  Not everything works for everybody.  I am concerned about how radioactive it is and when I can remember to ask my husband to bring home the office geiger counter I will get him to test it for that and report back.  I have no idea exactly where they dug this DE up and it could be near leaking nuclear power plants or next door to radio active waste dumps for all I know.  I sure hope not though.UPDATE: 4.25.14This past week-end my husband tested the diatomaceous earth with a geiger counter and found no significant radiation beyond background radiation.  This is good news for those who consume a lot of it."
77115,"have used for transmission fluid changes, axle fluid and steering fluid changes. easy to use, solid construction, several hoses included in the kit that can be ""daisy chained"" for longer runs. Took several minutes to pull 2.7 qts of 75-140 oil but it was unattended. Very handy. No cracks or flaws in mine. There are 1 qt graduations on the side."
77116,"I bought this to replace my Blue Snowball because I've reached that point where I require something that sounds a little bit more professional than what I was using. Before I begin my review, I'd like to mention that I use this with a Behringer 302USB Premium 5-Input Mixer with XENYX Preamp (copy and paste that into Amazon's search to find it). So my review is based on this thing being plugged into that thing.Okay, my pros and cons.Pros1. My voice sounds great with this thing. Before I was using a Snowball and my podcast partner told me it sounded like I was in a &#34;chamber&#34;. With this, my voice is strong and clear...and even a little bassy which is nice because I don't have a naturally bassy voice. I'm extremely satisfied with how well this thing makes me sound. It is WORLDS better than USB mics like the Blue Snowball. Worlds better.2. It's heft, heavy, and feels well made. This might be the most expensive-feeling device I own. It's heavy but it in a good way. The materials feel high quality. This feels like a professional microphone.3. It comes with a mic stand holder thing. Never say no to free stuff.Cons1. The only thing I can think of is that it doesn't come with its own cable. You'll need to buy an XLR cable on your own. It's not bad enough to deduct a star.There are people who are comparing this to the Shure SM57 and other microphones. Here's the thing, I am an amateur. Before I owned this mic, I was using a Blue Snowball and before that, my laptop webcam mic. So I am not the authority. All I can tell you is that this thing sounds freaking amazing. My podcast co-host immediately noticed the difference and couldn't tell me enough of how much better I sounded and that's over a Skype call (we podcast using Skype). So if you're looking for a vocal/podcast mic, this is a great, cheap option. Are there better options? Sure, but not for this price. Not even close. Recommended wholeheartedly."
77117,my favorite show.  I am way to addicted to it. cant wait till Monday morning to get the next episode on my kindle fire.
77118,"The Riches is the most recent TV show I've been watching, and I have one question. How in the world could they cancel it!? More people watched the premier of The Riches than ever watched an episode of the Shield or Rescue Me. It's also got to be one of the most creative shows I've ever seen! The show centers around the Molloy family, a family of modern day gypsies. Today is a big day for them as the matriarch of their family is being released from jail, after serving a two year sentence. A big party is thrown for her and all seems well in the Molloy family, but things aren't what they seem. The Molloy family is forced to leave their camp. Wayne (Eddie Izzard) is not going empty handed though. Before leaving he cracks the camp leaders safe and takes a substantial amount of money. Once on the road, they run into another family from camp, that had been oblivious to what was going on. It doesn't take them long to realize something isn't right, but before they can confront them, the Molloy's take off and a big highway RV chase begins. During the chase a passing motorist and his wife are killed. The man and woman are Doug and Shrine Rich, and they are on their way to a new home in Eden Falls. Doug was a savvy lawyer, who made a fortune at the expense of others. On this day he and his new wife were on the run also, moving away from everyone and everything they've ever known to move to a new state and into a new house they bought on the internet. Thanks to paper work in the car, Wayne Molloy quickly realizes who these people were and where they were going. It is then that he decides it's time to stop traveling the country and settle into a nice, normal, ""buffer"", lifestyle. Living in Eden Falls as Doug and Shrine. Along with their 3 kids, the Molloy's try to adapt from being a family of travelers to a family of wealth and stability. The show is amazing! There are so many twist and turns, cons and jokes, ups and downs, It's so well written, with an outrageous cast of characters, and most important of all, a storyline I promise you have never seen before!  The show was cancelled by FX in late 2008, but both seasons are available, and according to Wikipedia, Eddie Izzard and the show's creator are currently working on a full length feature film. If you want something different crossing comedy, drama, and action, then I'd say The Riches are for you!"
77119,"I've used and tried many modern waxes for my cars - some are good some are so-so and some are disappointed.I still remember the old ads of the Nu Finish Car Polish - oldest one was made in very early 70's, and the old product image of the Nu Finish Car Polish has been the main reason why I didn't buy and try it.Finally I bought it at a local store last week thanks to its cheap price and applied it to my white Mercedes-Benz. Right after applying and buffing, honestly I could not detect any difference. Next day, however, both I and my wife definitely can feel the difference at the same time when we opened the garage - more shiny and more butter like slippery than any other modern waxes!Now I clearly know why the most reviewers have given excellent scores to this magic polish.The Nu Finish Car Polish is a true Oldies But Goodies!"
77120,"I bought the red ones and the black ones.  I thought that if I installed red handles they would stick out like a sore thumb so anyone riding in the back would use these instead of holding the speaker bar, headrest or rollbar.  Instead they just look out of place and somewhat tacky..  I installed the black ones instead and I'll just keep the red ones in my jeep parts bin.  5 stars if they were black, I just didn't like the red."
77121,It's works. Nice and small. Cool looking. Does the job. Seams sturdy enought. Might even get a blue mic. I use with a MoJave
77122,This was probably the best season so far. Luckily I saw 200 & 201 when they were aired on TV (censored of course) but the fact that they are censored on DVD is complete BULL****!!!! I can't believe that Comedy Central released this DVD and still censored it.Usually I buy the seasons so I can watch them without commercials and UNCENSORED but I'm content with watching this season online for FREE. I returned this DVD to the store the next day. Comedy Central doesn't need my money anymore.
77123,I only started watching Gold Rush this season - the Hoffmans in Guyana.  I didn't even know who the Hoffmans and their crew were.  They are an interesting group of men.  Now some of their antics make sense after looking at Season 1.
77124,"This has got to be one of the best if not the best headlight restoration systems you can buy. I have used them on dozens of headlights and vehicles over the years and without fail, they produce excellent results that look good as new from about a foot or more every time and substantially increase headlamp output.The key with this system is using a corded drill (I seriously doubt any battery operated drill could even handle one headlight with the amount of time this takes) and being very, very patient. The instructions repeatedly remind the user that time spent on each individual step will reduce time needed at the next step. What they mean to say is, &#34;When you think you might be done, keep sanding. Then when you really think you're done, keep sanding more.&#34;Make sure you tape off (two layers at least) the painted parts of your vehicle that you do not want damaged by rotating sandpaper.There are usually enough supplies in the kit to do 2-6 headlights."
77125,"Update: I was going to return these, but I decided to use these. The plants *should* last a month inside these pots if I'm lucky.Update 2: Just noticed I'm missing 20 pots out of the 60 I ordered! I didn't count them because I was taking them as I needed.-------------------------------------------------------These are NOT 4 inch pots you will be getting. These are not even deep enough to transplant into. What you're getting is more like 3 inch pots. Avoid these!I compared these to my true 4"" pot's and these are a lot smaller.Mine came from the seller Seed kingdom."
77126,Had my battery tender plus for just over 2 years and it worked great for those 2 years maintaining the battery in an antique car. Recently I put it on the battery on my daily driver and the charge light didn't come on. Testing on several other batteries seems its lost its status lights and all its regulation and just puts out a constant 15 volts now cooking whatever battery I hook it up to. Their tech support was rude and unknowledgeable. Of course their warranty is a joke since it will cost 50% of its value just to make use of their warranty. I considered buying another but with so many other choices now on the market I can't rationalize the battery tenders high price. I replaced it with a Vector for the same price which has twice the features.
77127,"Amazon Prime apparently only includes the first episode, so I'm only rating the first episode.Despite the intriguing title of this series, it is laced with inaccuracies and pseudoscience, backed by testimonials that are little more than rumors."
77128,"The Disappearance of Alice Creed is a REALLY good thriller.  It's about two kidnappers that hold a young girl at ransom for 2 million dollars.  They come up with the perfect plan, the likes of which is completely original in all the years I've been watching movies with a similar concept.  And EXCITING?  You bet!To be totally honest, it would be a great disservice to explain in detail the way these events unfold because the way the story is written, spoiling the MANY twists and turns here on amazon would be an unfortune shame, so I can't do it.  Let's just say, there's an extremely good chance you've never seen a kidnappping plot quite like this one!  The ONLY thing I'll say is that one of the kidnappers is actually in a relationship with the girl tied down to the bed.  This leads to several more awesome segments and twists.  Oh and, betrayal and hiding the clues might be the key words to describe this movie, hehe.  Right down to the ending I had no idea which way the writers were taking this one- another sign of successfully executed storytelling.There's a couple sexual related scenes that are pretty strong, but other than that, expect to be on the edge of your seat anticipating all the ways these two masked men figure out exactly the right plan to obtain the money.  Actor Eddie Marsan is *tremendous* as a kidnapper.  A really believable looking and intimidating bad guy- perfect for the role.  He makes the movie as excellent as can be.  Highly recommended."
77129,Natalie Zea does a great job as the former cheerleader turned NFL owner widow and newest unwelcome owner of the Rebels.  Good supporting cast and decent writers give this a real chance.
77130,I find the writing to be engaging and exciting. I prefer stories that are a bit messy such as in real life. They tend not to button issues up nice and neat
77131,"George and his fellow bad members pick up small gigs at night, while working at the asylum during the day. As cooks fot the criminaly insane, it is their job to prepare and serve the food for the inmates. With a less than ideal job, the group is hoping to make it big sometime soon and leave the asylum for good. Unfortunatly for them, the inmates have other ideas.As a giant thunderstorm rolls through the town, the power at the asylum goes out. The lights don't turn on, the security doors are useless and the phones are dead. Reluctant at first, the cooks decide to restore order and bring the wandering inmates back to their cells. George and his friends soon realize the inmates my be insane, but they are not stupid. With an almost methodical plan of attack, the prisoners slowly begin to take over the darkened asylum. Armed with whatever they can find, the criminaly insane hunt down the gaurds and cooks, all while inflicting some serious pain.The overall production was seemless. The cimematography is absolutely top notch as not one frame from this film is out of place. The picture perfect lighting and color tone found within this film emphasizes the detail and dedication that went into this production. The acting is seriously some of the best to come from a low budget film in a long time. Rupert Evans, the actor playing George, is the dominate acting force in the movie. His performance was is true, beleivalbe and without hesitation. Be on the look out for more from Evans.IFC Midnight comes through big time with their release of Asylum Blackout. Director Alexandre Courtes delivers the scares and the gore in new and inventive ways. The blood is plentyful and the deaths are to die for. Along with the great direction, the superb camera work and acting ensures this 2012 horror/thriller hits on all cylinders."
77132,"Good writing, good acting, quirky plots. It is campy enough that the absurdity of the story line is hilarious. What's not to like?"
77133,"This is a great product, just not for me. I found it brightened my tone way too much and I went back to plastic. Gave my guitar a bad metallic sound, and I lost bottom end."
77134,"Smart, funny, with a likeable, if frustrating at times, cast . . .a true breath of fresh air compared to the filth that passes for entertainment on most channels"
77135,"I've loved this show since the pilot. &#34;No snoring and no fornication. We usually get both with breakfast.&#34; We get that tidbit about midway through the episodes before the credits are done rolling. Some of the writing is subtle (The 115% sign on the side of Biggs' campaign bus) and some of it has me chuckling and sometimes snickering out loud. Gary Trudeau is an engaging writer who has a way of making political absurdity funny. John Goodman is wonderful in his role as Biggs, but the entire cast is shines in this show. I'll watch it as long as Mr. Trudeau keeps writing it."
77136,"Best guitar picks. Great shape, sturdy. No fancy expensive flashy grip features. Guitar pics as the God's of Rock intended."
77137,"I've read where people are using bottle caps instead of these. My guitar is more valuable to me than that I suppose, because I'm not trusting that my expensive gitty won't hit the floor. I mean you pay for a quality instrument right? Why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe? I'm sorry but that's just idiocy in action. This isn't 1960, get an upgrade already. I play standing up 95% of the time, so these are a necessity. I have had these separate on me when taking them off hastily, but all except one snapped right back together. When I first started playing, I had a brand new (to me) guitar hit the floor and the neck break because I didn't use them. That's something that should only happen once in your life, if at all. The only complaint I have is whatever happened to the round ones? They were a bit more appealing to the eye and do the same thing just as well."
77138,"Fuzzbean noted that Amazon is mixing reviews for the 5 watt version (which this review is about) and a less powerful version (2.5 watts) so pay attention to mentions of suction cups - they are apparently included with the 2.5W as there are no suction cups included with the 5W edition.  Not that I have anything against suction cups, you understand.I'm tardy in posting this Vine review because I found this difficult to seriously test in my environment.  I have no rarely-used vehicles.  The battery I need to maintain is really two batteries connected together in parallel to supply an inverter for emergency use during a power outage.  Each of the two is a 12V 110Ah AGM battery (relatively robust batteries).  I didn't expect to be able to tell that this device was doing a lot for them as they take a while to drain appreciably under load and my guess is that a low-volt/low-amp trickle charge would take days to recharge them if it ever did.So I just hooked up a borrowed multimeter and started taking measurements.  Even with a pretty good coating of pine pollen (it's that time of year in NC) and full cloud cover I was consistently seeing 6+ volts  When I wiped the panel clean and the sky cleared, I tried again and consistently saw readings of 7 - 8 volts even though the panel was not in direct sun.  Due to my own ignorance I was unable to get a reliable milliamp reading but I'm hoping that since the voltage output exceeds promises, the milliamps at least meet them.  This 5W version promises 410 milliamps vs. the 2.5W version's 180 milliamps.One thing that bothered me a little was a ""helpful tip"" in the accompanying instructions: ""For extra waterproofing and to extend the life of the panel, cone bead around the edges of the inside frame.""  I guess I should be handier, but ""cone bead"" implies to me that I need to go buy some kind of caulk (last time I was at Wally World there were a zillion kinds of caulk and you can count on me to always choose the wrong one) and seal the thing up.  If this is a good thing to do, why not just do it before it leaves the factory?  Anything I put caulk on ends up looking like a pastry item decorated by the Three Stooges so maybe I'm just overly sensitive.  And don't get me started on ""cone bead"" as a compound verb.I should confess that I own a NOCO Genius G7200 charger/maintainer that I'm very happy with, so I may have a bias toward their products (for the suspicious, the G7200 was not a Vine thing; I bought it with my own real money).  I was tempted to ding this solar panel a star for the ""cone bead"" thing but gave that star back because these people seem to offer good stuff at reasonable prices and this feels like a solid, well made item.  If you have use for this kind of thing, the current Amazon price of $35 seems very reasonable."
77139,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a proud owner of:- Gibson ES125 Acoustic/Electric- Pono MSD-E- Blackheart BH5H- Blackheart BH110- A Weber Vintage Series 10A125 (10 inch, 8 ohm, 30 watts) in an open back, solid pine cabinet- A Jensen Mod 10-50 (10 inch, 4ohm, 50 watts)- All tube Fender Tweed ChampNow that you know the gear I have, what I can play through an amp, and what I can plug an amp head into, I'll sum up my review with this:What you get out of this amp is completely dependent on your speaker cab, the cables you use, and how clean your power is. Got good gear?  This little amp will sound great.The DetailsThe amp itself is tiny.  I have an Electro-Harmonix pedal that's bigger than this amp! Still, it packs a punch.  With the gain at about 1/3 up and the volume at half, I get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue.  Crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go.  Yes, this little amp will go from Jazz & Country to Rock & Metal with a twist of a dial.The line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have.  If you want to quietly play along with some tunes, you can.  Practice time just got better for your neighbors.The one lone tube in the Micro Terror is the pre-amp tube.  Mine came stock with a JJ Tubes 12AX7.  I understand that's standard.  A JJ is nice, but it will *not* warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone.  Dig out an old Phillips, RCA, Sylvania, or GE to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother.  I had an old GE made in Great Britain lying around and popped it in my Micro Terror: warmed it right up; cleaned up a bunch of high-end tinniness.Still, compared to my two-tube BH5H or my all tube Champ, this guy does sound more solid state than anything.  BUT, compared to a buddy's Roland and solid state Ampeg, it's downright mellow.No effects loop means that your time-based effects (reverb, echo, chorus) can get noisy. So, if you like pedals, stock up on 9 volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in.Speaking of power adapters: a previous reviewer is right.  The external power brick for this guy seems fragile.  I'm not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp. It's holding up, but one round with my cat and I'll be looking for a new power supply.The RubAnnoyance #1:  One cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying HISS even at low volumes.  I found that out quickly.  So, get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp.  I'm running it with a GLS 12 gauge speaker cable and a Planet Waves American Stage instrument cable - both available here at Amazon or any good guitar shop.Annoyance #2:  This is a 20 watt amp, right?  WELL... if you don't run a 4ohm speaker, you won't get all 20 watts.  The Micro Terror self-adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output. (Yes yes... don't quote physics to me.)  At 8ohms, I still get good volume.  But at 16ohms (like my BH110) it sounds like a 5 or 7 watt amp.  That said, I'm actually a fan of the tone I get with my 8ohm Weber in its pine cab. The 8 inch Jensen speaker in my Champ, while nice, can't put out the low notes like I'd prefer and the Jensen Mod 10-50 is TOO clean.  But the Weber 10A125 sounds fantastic to my ears; even with the loss in volume.Annoyance #3: The Micro Terror is so small and so light, it'll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord.  Unlike a nice 20 pound amp, the chord won't pull out.  So: BE CAREFUL.Mitigation for Annoyance #3: The all steel chassis can handle a tumble from three feet up onto hardwood floors... though, it will gouge your floor.And then there's the standard annoyance that comes with owning any guitar amplifier: if the power is noisy or ungrounded, you will wind up with hiss no matter what.  I always carry a Monster HTS 350 and run my amp through it; that REALLY helps in cleaning up signal noise.  (If you don't have one, get one.  The 300 & 350 are cheap and they work.)The SummaryAfter all that, I can still say:  I love this little amp!  I've gigged with it and it sings well.  Plus, the added gag of tiny ukulele + tiny amp always draws a laugh... until I crank the dial over and shred some faces.For the price, you can likely afford to pick up $40 worth of guitar/speaker chords and wind up with a healthy rig.  And, for the price, this is a solid 4 star amp.  I know I'm happy."
77140,"I bought a set of these in 6K and they are perfect. The light emitted is bright white without any hint of blue, exactly what I wanted. I just kind of wish the pigtails on the bulbs were a little longer. The short pigtails on the bulb made it a little more difficult to install. Aside from that, great bulbs!"
77141,My favorite cartoon from when I was a kid! I've been waiting a LONG TIME for these DVD. Thank GOD!! I'm all for Ickis! He's my favorite!!! I'm glad these are back. Check em out! You'll love these little guys!
77142,"For being electric it has good power. Enough to take a little paint off. I put it close to wash a piece of tar off and it took it off allright and the paint with it. Seems to leak a bit where the garden hose connects, but I can live with that, or probably try to find a brass connector and replace it.."
77143,Emotional/mental whiplash of the highest measure.  Belly laughs and gut-wrenching emotions coming so swift and suddenly that it's impossible to absorb in just one viewing.  The mind racing to keep up and understand all the implications of each reveal.  A MUST OWN EPISODE if there ever was one.  And there's dozens of those - but this is a topper!)
77144,"For those who love shaky fake found footage, this one is da bomb. A group of criminals film their escapades of vandalism and assaults to sell to a buyer. They then enter a house to get a VHS tape, they will know it when they see it. The rest of the movie shows us found footage film within a found footage film. Oh joy. There is a dead man in the house sitting in front of a series of TVs. Each hooligan watches a film segment, then disappears from the movie. The film segments are not connected, i.e. there is no real common theme other than it is more snuff than horror with a different type of monster/entity in each piece.The final installment, I thought had the best special effects, but with the jerky camera motion and people screaming makes it difficult to enjoy any of it.Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, and plenty of nudity, including full frontal (Hannah Fierman)."
77145,"This was a fun mix of entertaining personalities and obviously talented chefs.  There are some intense tempers and personality clashes, but I like that that is not the focus of the show as with some other reality programming."
77146,Anybody might die and a lot of people do in Justified.  Sometimes it's no surprise and sometimes it really sneaks up on you with a gut punch.  Really good entertainment as long as plenty of realistic violence mixed with good story and great acting are your thing.
77147,This show is highly addictive. You get involved in the rich story lines and you will fall in love with the cast.
77148,"If you want to restore the new tire look, this is the stuff. Easy to use. If you have curb scrapes just stiff brush the tire with car soap and water, dry tire and apply. This does not give you that glaring shine nor is it formulated to. The tires look as new when done. Great product."
77149,"- Large can holds 5 gallons of gas- Didn't spill in my experience filling it, the nozzle seems to be designed better than previous cans I've owned.- Perfect for a storm/generator situation when you don't want to go out and fill up gas cans every few hours.- Reccommended."
77150,"Spoiler Alert:I think the surprise end is what sealed it for me. I think I get the point they were making (or were they?). But then, it doesn't explain why all the other deaths have occurred at the tentacles of the monsters. It seemed like they were displaying non-aggressive and inquisitive creatures, who probably attack when provoked only. Yeah, that explained the death of the couple's parties, as the guys went with guns blazing (to save the other family?). But all of the deaths?Some gaps in the plot. The wall was open. It looks like it was not a gated opening so much as just open. And what would be the point?Why was the girl down in Mexico anyway? Why did Dad want her home before the migration?Why was a passport necessary to get on the ferry? The man had already seen it, and allowed them to purchase a ticket. Another family coming to the US was clearly Mexican (sans passports obviously).Well some questions, but we excuse the gaps because the story wasn't about precision, and the romantic dance at the end was somewhat profound."
77151,"I bought this to provide extra heat prevention/protection for my short ram intake heat shield. My brand intake is a Neuspeed on my 2012 MKVI Jetta 2.5L SEL.It is easy to shape/trace to the shape of the item being wrapped and easy to cut/place. So far, the heat wrap has lasted and I see no peeling, especially after having lasted through two heavy days of raining. I did a temp-check with remote thermostats and found an additional 67F difference with the heat shield being wrapped versus not. A definite difference and benefit from before -- after! I will post a picture this evening to go along with my review."
77152,"After reading many of the reviews here, my expectations were probably set too high.  Many purchasers have made this thing sound like it sprinkles water from the fountain of youth at pressures to rival Old Faithful.It is well made and should last many years.  Other than that, it sprays out water prett much like any other hose nozzle I have ever used.  It is a quality product but I do not understand all the raves."
77153,"As a Jason Statham fan I was disappointed with Redemption.  The plotline was weird along with the unbelievable character Statham played in the film. His character is an ex-Afghanistan vet bedeviled by PTSD, who becomes almost homicidal when sober and helpless when drunk.  He has sex with a nun, who is also a hard to conceive character. Looks to me that the movie was just cranked out to make a few dollars."
77154,"I love the set up, especially having read the books. This series will lead up to the point Jack realizes who Hannibal is, in the Red Dragon (well, shown in the movie). I guess I am losing it because I didn't really understand the first episode. Hopefully either my brain will get stronger or the writing will improve. Either way I am behind the series and will give it a big chance. I hope the network does too. It's going to take allot to sell this new Hannibal but the actor may pull it off. He needs to speak a little louder and MUCH clearer though; his accent is heavy enough that some of his words are difficult to hear/understand.-edit: Here, at the end of the season, having watched each episode twice (I convinced my wife to watch it again with me), I am convinced that this is one of the best series TV has to present. It went, for me, from 3 stars for the first episode, to 5 stars for the series. I can hardly wait to see the next season!"
77155,"Timmy is the greatest cartoon ever! At least that is what my 2-year-old thinks. We were heartbroken when it was removed from Netflix last fall, but so incredibly happy to have found it on Amazon streaming!"
77156,"I bought this specifically so I would not have the other lugs rattling around in the center console and stay together with the Key Lock.  I got all 4 lugs and the key into the pouch.  It's nylon, its is not heavy duty ballistic nylon, but then it doesn't need to be.  This worked well enough and keeps them from rattling that I placed them in the Jack Well on the Jeep.  Better than using a zip lock bag by far.  Cost is very reasonable."
77157,"I realize Two Lovers is exactly what the description says- it's about an immature man who still lives with his parents completely torn between two women.One woman is shy, loyal and young, and would like nothing more than to be involved in a relationship.  The other woman (the hot blonde) has emotional issues that dominate her life on a daily basis and unfortunately for the guy, she treats him more like a brother or a friend so he can try the best he can to understand her problems and comfort her in dire times of need.Well it's obvious which woman *I'd* choose, but I reckon there's a slight bit of cleverness involved in the making of Two Lovers.  You see, the storyline makes you wonder which woman YOU'D choose- the one who's slightly less attractive but totally loyal and polite, or the slightly more attractive one with constant personal issues that never seem to stop being an obvious distraction.  I'd choose the loyal one myself.  It's a no brainer.Anyway, the actual plotline is so incredibly *slow* that the film almost put me to sleep on a few different occasions.  However this is perhaps because it's totally stuck in romance, which is definitely NOT right up my alley, haha.Still, it's a passable film that serves as a nice way to pass the time on a rainy night with nothing better to do.  I just wish the plotline actually picked up more often- then I'd give the film a higher rating."
77158,"great show, got hooked watching seasons one and two on amazon prime, wish they'd make season 3 prime (free) too.mark this review helpful if you agree.how can you not get hooked?UPDATE: Season 3 was short, wanting more!"
77159,These apple wood chips make smoke but I have found that I prefer hickory or mesquite wood chips rather than apple.
77160,"Started of good and seems to be getting better. I haven't watched enough of them to make a final star rating decision, and so I give it a 3 for now."
77161,I wasn't sure what to expect with this show. I have to say I'm impressed. I could see this maturing into a great show. It's something new and not the same old same old. I think that's what made it so entertaining.
77162,"The shield is a gritty, needle in the eye kind of series. You find yourself rooting for a bad cop who thinks it his God given right to mead out justice ghetto street style!"
77163,WOW something to scream about this vintage tube overdrive wont get you tied but will keep you producing and reproducing hit after hit.
77164,This series had so much promise. It was obviously planned for more than one season with the premise of tracking down some 63 inmates one at a time who disappeared from The Rock back in the 1960's. Unfortunately it lasted only one season. Each prisoner had his own &#34;story&#34; and there was an ongoing sub-plot involving the 1960's warden and some dark medical experiments being conducted in the prison. We will never know the outcome since the series disappeared just as the prisoners had. Perhaps it will reappear in 50 years. One can always hope.
77165,"This is my second time purchasing this for my Acura RL. I am 100% not sure about the pollen crap, but I am certain the weird smell is gone."
77166,makes me want to travel more.  It's interesting to see the diverse architecture & variety of other cultures around the world.
77167,"I have a couple of cheap cage suet feeders like this:Heath Manufacturing S-1-8 Single Hanging Suet Feeder.  They're inexpensive, lightweight, and they get the job done.  The problem is that unwanted animals like grackles and squirrels have no problem dining endlessly at that type of buffet.I am very impressed with this Stokes suet feeder.  The very first thing I noticed when I pulled it out of the box was its heft.  It has some weight to it.  The cage wire is a bit thicker than the standard inexpensive suet cages.  If you look at the additional picture I uploaded, you'll also see that the actual square suet cages are attached to the bottom of the feeder with thick wire supports. The top is also thicker and more rigid than the stock picture might indicate.  Likewise, the metal screw cap securely holds the top in place with no worries about stripping the screw post.  The hanging ring is thick steel.  The ring is squeezed into--or captured in--the screw cap.I'm not sure what the ""double locking closure system"" is that is referred to in the product description.  The only closure on this suet feeder is the top which is then held in place by the screw-on cap.I'll add visitor statistics as time goes on.  So far, I've had a hairy woodpecker dine with little difficulty.Edit:  After a couple months of use, I've noticed regular visits by flickers, red-bellied woodpeckers, chickadees, nuthatches, downy woodpeckers, and hairy woodpeckers.  It does a fine job of keeping fox squirrels out, and large birds like grackles struggle on it sparingly.  The biggest downside so far?  Opossums or raccoons learned easy access to the suet cakes and devoured two full cakes overnight.  It looks like I'll still need to put a pole baffle in place in order to keep the four-footed critters off."
77168,"My husband watched it together and we both enjoyed it. There was some unreality involved, but it was still good."
77169,"As a movie store owner I had to give this one a shot. I suppose I was watching more of the background and props than I was the performances during the store scenes, but at least they got the customer nuances correct (the giggling-obsessed teen girls, the widowed old guy renting on his anniversary, the strange porn addicted gal, etc.).I do not feel the description is written well (over usage of claustrophobic - neither place is that bad) and the cover art/pics never happen in the film, but I gave it a fair shot since it is being advertised as a 2008 Sundance hit. Our story follows a homeless video store clerk as he stalks a porn-addicted agoraphobic cuckoo girl customer. SPOILERS; Tons of unbelievable events and un-described character issues fill the screen for 90 minutes, punctuated by two cameos (Tom Arnold as the offender dad [3rd perv role for him in as many films - scary]and Charles Durning as the old guy customer). His co-worker crew all have their little idiosyncratic nuances for the slight comic relief, with the story shifting between them and the love interest premise of a who-can-creep-out-the-potential-girlfriend/boyfriend-more-but-still-sleep-together motif.The film quality is average as is the 5.1 (with a 2.0 option). The main supplement about being played at Sundance lasts over an hour, but since they went the un-narrated way/made at home feel I liked it. The gag reel option lasts 11 minutes and was actually funny only once or twice, should have been called a bad take reel.A decent freshman attempt at making a totally obscure relationship film about creepy people, gave three for the film and one for the supplements. Just not sure if I can outright recommend this without adding some disclaimers; ""innocent"" on the cover art is furthest from the truth, ""funny"" is subjective on this, and the title is going for the shock value as it is never stated in the film. Enjoy."
77170,Works well in my Jeep... I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a custom one.  This does the trick... I probably won't use it forever but I'm  happy with it for the time being.  I left it sit out in the driveway to bake out the wrinkles for a little while.  While it was warmed up I did some trimming.  I keep the dog's kennel on this and it doesn't slide around much with normal driving.
77171,"I've had this a couple of years now and it works great for my needs.  I used it again this weekend to clean up from a big snowstorm we had a couple of weeks ago.  It chewed up branches up to 5"" thick easily. Ironically, it's the little twig pieces that occasionally will cause the chain to dismount.  This has only happened to me twice and was easily fixed with a 1/2"" socket wrench and a little common sense.  I have a full size B&D chainsaw I no longer use because this is so much easier and frankly less intimidating.  If you're a logger or frequently cutting firewood maybe you more, otherwise it's really handy to have around.  I can't recall the last time I added a=oil by the way, of course that's probably not something you want to emulate."
77172,"If you are looking for an easy to apply and fast working cleaner for your wheels, then this product is at the top of my list. Just spray it onto the wheels and watch the dirt and grim drop to the bottom. You can wash it off with almost no effort. A great product."
77173,"for years we had larger grills on wheels and they always lasted about 4 to 5 years because we had no inside storage for them. Living on The Oregon Coast can ruin a good grill in a couple years, even the so called stainless ones. They rust faster then the painted ones unless it made of 316 grade  marine stainless which runs into the thousands. This small weber grill works great ,cooks fast and just stores on a garage shelf during bad weather. And the outside is made of aluminum that holds up great . An added plus is we can take it to the beach as wellRuns on 1 pound tanks or purchase a separate hose as we did to use you 20 pound tank(a lot cheaper)"
77174,As others have said they are basically all the same so this one is less money so if you want/need this kind this is the way to go.
77175,"I nearly choked to death laughing when Lamond said, &#34;He said three muthaf*cker!&#34; That's when I knew the show would be funny. I was laughing throughout the show. I liked several of the characters on the show. I definitely want to watch more episodes."
77176,"This is a nice series to watch on cooking and i find myself really liking the cook and her family. It is not just a cooking show but a little peek, also, into the life of ranching. You have to love the kitchen in this series, too... lord who has that in their own home??? The only thing i struggle with in this series is the close in angles of the camera. It is really, really annoying. And just when you want to see the FOOD, you, instead, get a camera shot of the cook. For a cooking show, we dont want to see the cook. We want to see the food being made and we dont want our noses shoved into ot so close. Pull back that camera angle amd give us some space!"
77177,"Enough of these whiny men! Jane showed sass, guts and verve. Do not cross a beauty queen!  I want to see more of this!"
77178,I liked the series. Good stories and I enjoy the era. Not too deep but moved along very well. I think you will enjoy!
77179,"Purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me. This cloth cleans up pretty well, but what i noticed after wiping down the strings a few times is that the fibers would hook. I dunno if they weren't meant to wipe the strings with but my ernie ball cloth is A LOT more durable than this cloth. They do the job but i believe that the ernie ball cloth does it better. Like a previous reviewer, i'm a little iffy about putting this cloth in the washer.Update: Putting it in the watcher was fine and idk why but after washing it for the first time it cleans up 1000000x better than before, i like this and my ernie ball cloth :)From 3 to 5 starts!!"
77180,"My son is 9 and LOVES the Wild Kratts. These are 2 funny guys who have a great time with animals. They don't dumb it down or use irritating repetitive songs so I've found myself taking a break and enjoying an episode here and there also. I strongly recommend this program for any kid who has curious about the great outdoors, animals of all kinds and having fun."
77181,Something this simple makes me wonder why I haven't always had one. Wipe your wash mitt or cloth over the grate and the grit falls to the bottom and away from your car. Simple and Effective.
77182,"Used this tool to remove my fuel line on a fuel filter change...OMG I was under the truck for over a hour wrestling with it! Eventually the tool broke! What a piece of junk! I ordered the metal sissor one off of Amazon, got the fuel line off in 2 minutes!!! LITERALLY! I heard the click, and the fuel filter just came out! Save yourself some time and aggrevation...if you have a Ford truck, get the sissor tool, not this plastic junk."
77183,"""Train"" as my granddaughter calls it will get a 5 star all the time, it is entertaining to us both and has a layed back theme."
77184,"recently installed a set in the front and back of my 08 jeep rubicon unlimited.  very heavy duty velcro straps, very tough and appear to be very durable.  would recommend and would buy again."
77185,"I'm loving the new direction of Castle.  Not the FBI thing, which never worked for me and my lady.  But the out-in-the-open-affianced part."
77186,This is a VERY high quality SCI-FYI show.  There is no need to have already watched previous Stargate shows to enjoy this one as well. The only sad thing is that MGM went broke during its run and it was shelved years too early.
77187,"I was interested in trying this product to keep the deer away from the hostas in my yard.  In reading and re-reading the product description here at Amazon, I couldn't find out what was in it.  I'm allergic to capsaicin (chili peppers), and I've had allergic reactions to animal repellents in the past, so I needed to know if this product has any capsaicin. Fortunately, the product description includes a toll free number to call for more information.  The customer service representative on the other end of the line was extremely helpful.  She told me Deer Off contains not only capsaicin, but also egg solids and garlic.  So if you're allergic to eggs, capsaicin, or garlic, you shouldn't use this product.  She suggested I try another Havahart product, Defense, instead, which has eggs, but no capsaicin.So, while I didn't get to try Deer Off because of my allergies, I found Havahart Customer Service quite polite as well as informative and helpful.  But since this product contains food ingredients, the foods should be listed here on the product description page so that people with food allergies can easily tell what's in it before ordering it.  In general, if you have food allergies, especially to eggs or spices, always check the ingredients of animal repellents before using them in your yard."
77188,What more to say.  I have used a different clay bars but this one is priced better than most it seems and does the job well.
77189,"the Pinstripe heads are AMAZING.  I will buying them for life, they are very durable and sound great.  the emperor X snare head on the other hand is junk.  It makes my snare sound like a high tom almost, hate it."
77190,"In the mood for an old fashioned ghost story?  You could certainly do worse than the entertaining mini-series ""The Secret of Crickley Hall.""  Adapting the 2006 novel from the prolific Best Selling author James Herbert, BBC fashioned a handsome supernatural tale that has both heart and horror.  Stretched over three hour long episodes, the story has the time to develop at its own pace without rushing.  Some of the developments can seem a bit far-fetched, as you might expect.  But by focusing on character, the mini-series remains grounded due to it having invested the time to actually make you care about the outcome for the lead family.  Even as the main saga gets loopier and less faithful to the source material, I always remained connected.  Perhaps ""The Secret of Crickley Hall"" is not the scariest or most realistic ghost story ever made, but that's a rather lofty expectation to have!  It was, however, genuinely well executed, well acted, and atmospheric.  So I was happy enough to invest the three hours into this supernatural excursion.The initiating event in ""The Secret of Crickley Hall"" is the disappearance of a little boy.  One day at the playground, the mother (Suranne Jones) falls asleep and the boy simply vanishes.  In a state of grief and withdrawal, she blames herself for the tragedy and can't move past it.  Approaching the one year anniversary of that fateful day, the father (Tom Ellis) accepts a temporary assignment that would require a brief relocation which he hopes can be a new start for his troubled family.  Moving to the country with Jones, his two daughters, and their dog seems like a great way to spend a few months!  Unfortunately for them, they decide to rent Crickley Hall.  Why would this sweet family of four rent this massive building that used to be an orphanage?  I found it best not to question these mundane details, so I just went with it.  It soon becomes apparent that Crickley Hall is housing its share of secrets (hey, that's in the title!) and is the home of some rather unpleasant goings-on.  As the family is terrorized, they seek answers from the creepy locals and this opens up flashbacks of abuse within the orphanage at the hands of a maniacal headmaster (a delightfully over-the-top Douglas Henshall).The story plays out in parallel timelines.  Jones has an almost psychic connection to her missing son, and the strange house brings them closer together (at least in her mind).  Before all is said and done, the past and the present will collide.  Can the family survive and prevent the house from claiming more victims?  As I said, the end game gets bigger and less logical, but I rooted for both Jones and Ellis to persevere.  Both give solid and likable performances.  I also thought Henshall was great as he teetered on the brink of insanity as is Sarah Smart as his enabling sister.  The heroine of the back story is portrayed sympathetically and strongly by Olivia Cooke.  In her time, she attempts to protect one mistreated boy and expose the atrocities of the manor.  In both plot threads, the tension escalates appropriately as the story nears its conclusion.  Not all of the biggest surprises are particularly surprising, but things wrapped up quite satisfactorily for me.  Years from now, I won't be saying that this adaptation of ""The Secret of Crickley Hall"" was a television classic.  But the experience was fitfully entertaining in the now, and is easily recommended to those who enjoy the genre.  KGHarris, 8/13."
77191,"I've been a fan of this sitcom and Zooey Deschanel since it began - she can do no wrong.  During its evolution, I found that every episode was headed in a good direction and kept me wanting to watch more. The chemistry between the characters Jess and Nick is unmistakable and encourages the audience to expect their relationship to grow.  I've seen really good sitcoms come and go and really bad ones run forever.  I truly hope this sitcom doesn't become a premature casualty.  The writers need to keep each episode fresh with something new and not head down a stagnant path.  For example, the latest episode, Neighbors, seemed pointless as the cheesy young neighbors came across as pretentious and immature while the main character's goal was to seek their approval for reasons unknown - why would mature professional adults seek the approval of younger wanna-bees? This just made no sense to me and became frustrating.  I just hope future episodes do not include the neighbors or it may lead to the demise of this sitcom."
77192,"Believe this 5 feet Cable is no small thing. The Jacks are high quality construction. Very very durable. The cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable. I plan on enjoying this Cable for many many years. I'm glad I bought it, and thanks to Amazon who made it available."
77193,Since much of my family comes from Scotland and Ireland this series interests me a lot. Combine the rich and very interesting Celt history with music by Enya and it's a fantastic program.
77194,"I'm from that area, and it's pretty close to spot on with MANY of the characters! The only thing that screws it up is when you see the outdoor locations which are NOTHING like KY. (i.e. the mountains of CA and the desert-ish locales)  Wish they'd film on location!"
77195,"Star Trek reboot kicks butt. Plus, I live in Iowa, so it's pretty fun seeing RIVERSIDE IOWA on the screen!"
77196,I use this gauge for checking pressure in my car's tires to insure the pressure is balanced. The gauge is easy to use. The reason for four stars is that the accuracy is only 0.5 psi due to the decimal digit only displaying the number 0 or 5. I could estimate the pressure more accurately on my analog tire gauge that had a pointer like the second hand on a clock. But after many years of use the analog gauge broke and I decided to try a digital gauge. For ease of use I prefer this digital gauge with the light. For accuracy I prefer the analog gauge.
77197,"Works perfect for what it is designed for. We bought this for the bumper on our travel trailer. It was a breeze to install and holds up very well. Most times we just use it for a 4 bike rack but I have used it a couple of times to pull or 3 person Kawasaki Jetski as well (~1,000 lbs). I would definately recommend this to anyone."
77198,Man O Man this is just the best stuff! The slickest stuff around and is my only wax I use for all my cars and Im picky! Goes on easy!
77199,"Well written, well acted.  One actually like the bad guys until one reminds oneself that these personable guys and gals kill people, sell and distribute drugs, etc.  However you look at it, Timothy Olyphant is a cool dude and a lawman to the core."
77200,"I love Kevin Bacon, and I was very happy with Season 1 of The Following and was looking forward to Season 2.  Then Season 2 started and I completely lost interest.  Really?  Joe Carroll should be dead.  Claire should be dead.  By the end of Season 1 I was tired of both of these characters and was glad for the closure their deaths brought.  The writers could have taken the story and the characters anywhere, God know there are plenty of nut jobs out there to get inspiration from,  but &#34;resurrecting&#34; Joe Carroll was just ridiculous to me."
77201,"I own four of these,all purchased from Amazon over the past 3 years. They are great foldables, probably the best out there, and offer superb value for the price but they are not without room for improvement. Comments below:PROS- Heavyweight, sturdy design- Inner lining is perfect waterproof nylon- Completely foldable so they lay flat- Really good value for the priceCONS- Outer canvas shell is off-white color, very hard to clean- Outer canvas shell is canvas material, very hard to clean- Outer bottom is also canvas white, gets dirty very quicklyBottom line, this would have been the perfect product had Rubbermaid used a synthetic, easier to clean material for the out shell and added some nylon or rubber reinforcements to the bottom so it doesn't get dirty so quick and can withstand for wear such as getting dragged around the floor. Small changes would have yielded big results."
77202,"Check the dimensions carefully.  I bought this to store a pistol and ammo when out in the desert / woods.  Really it is too small for that. It will hold a wallet, small purse or pocket type camera but that is about it.  For example a Ruger 1911 or Glock 19 will not fit in here.On another note, the unit is a quality built item.  Good lock, good slides, carpeted, and goes right into place under the seat.So depending on what you are looking to use this for it could be a good buy, but I think for most it is too small."
77203,The installation is easy and the fit clips in securely. The blade's arch form maintains contact with the glass surface for consistently clear wipes. I am quite pleased with the results.The Clear Advantage blades have a nice clean look. The cost is reasonable for excellent performance.
77204,"I remember the hoopla when this was being made and how everyone distanced themselves from it after pressure from the Kennedy's.Made me assume it would be cartoonish or schmaltzy. I was wrong.In my opinion, it is as good as anything ever about the Kennedy's and there has been a lot. Must be difficult to tell a tale that has been told so many times before and make it sound fresh.Well done, it gave me a different angle into that family dynamic"
77205,"I love that this product is really organic and will not harm anything, just keep it away.  I know some people are complaining about the smell, and while it is a bit black peppery, it does the job.  Frankly, I would rather notice the black pepper smell than to have to put up with some chemical smell and wonder if it was harming me, my dog or the environment.I had a problem with possum getting into the garbage cans, and tried lots of other stuff that neighbors and friends said would work.  None of them did, but so far this is working for 2 weeks straight.  I know it is working, because I have seen possum getting into other trash cans in the neighborhood, but avoiding ours.  Another neighbor has complained about raccoons and squirrels, but have not had problems with them, either.  We've had some rainfall since I put it out, but the rain was light and did not seem to wash away the powder to the extent that it quit working.  The only reason I am not yet giving it five stars is because it's only been a few weeks."
77206,What can I say? I loved the (early) X-Files and I love Chris Carter's work.  I truly hope the powers that be fund this series.  I want more!  It was excellent!
77207,"It kills, and i'm a tenderheart that doesn't like killing.  But this darn critter was damaging our apartment's community garden, and so I set this up in a recent tunnel, and he is no more."
77208,"While some of the science in this show is not an absolute at this time, there is a lot of good material here.  I might have remained in Physical/Bio-archaeology if I could have gotten an internship at the Jeffersonian.  Alas, The Jeffersonian doesn't exist.  The characters are good.  And the plots hold your interest.  I also love the subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle humor.Good fun watch."
77209,As the story unfolds the seams begin to catch back into the cloth&#8230;what you think the story line is becomes more convoluted and the patterns reveal tears; intrigue leaves you wondering if the protagonist is victim or perpetrator.  I liked the characters and the story line; I was drawn in and want to know what happens next&#8230;.
77210,"The birds don't like it at all....I saw about four just sit at the feeder and try to figure out what they were supposed to do.  I think one of the birds actually flipped me off for getting this.  If you don't tighten the lid and bottom secure enough the bird seed will spill ALL over your floor, and it's amazing how quickly a full bird feeder will empty on the ground.  I would have to say that I can't see how a squirrel would get to the food...I will say that about it.  But what good is it if the birds don't get to it either?  I'll probably go back to one of the others and just feed the squirrels with the birds."
77211,"When I got a chance to review this product, I had read that an Android app would be available in January 2014. When I went to the Parrot website, however, they could only provide a signup to be notified when the Android version is available ""sometime in the first half of 2014."" I'll have to update my actual experience with the monitor itself after the free Android app comes out. For those who already have Apple products, there's a free app that allows you to access the online plant database to monitor the needs of various types of plants and also read the sensor.This review is going to deal with my initial impressions only. First, I've used the early Easy Bloom product, which requires you to physically dump data onto your computer via a USB plug-in thingie. The Flower Power monitors more than the Easy Bloom (fertilizer needs!) and is wireless to boot. I didn't like how the Easy Bloom app was always ""on,"" hogging resources; I'm hoping the Flower Power will be different.Both products depend on accessing data from a web site, but I found Parrot's database to be a lot more accessible. Even without the app or the product hooked up, I was able to check out the database and will use it to help me plan what I plant this spring when, hopefully, I'll have the Android app. First, there's an A-to-Z sorter at the top of the page, and there are also great filters: Type (Grass, Interior Plants, Shrubs, Trees, Vines, Edibles), Shape/Habit, Bloom Color, Leaf Color, Lifetime (Annual, Biennial, Perennial), and Bloom Season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). A search box not only finds what you look for, it tells you how many instances it found. So, for ""cucumbers,"" I got 33 varieties/hits; ""bush bean,"" 25 hits; ""bean,"" 68 hits, including bush beans, lima beans, regular old beans, plus anything that has ""bean"" in the common name, like Jacobean lily, Castor bean, Lucky bean tree, and Caribbean Red (pepper).Without the app, you can go to parrot/flowerpower and peruse the database to see how it's laid out. I found it very accessible and appealing, with its clear layout and wonderful photos, and it includes very helpful planting and plant care info, both hardiness and heat zones, even interesting facts about the plants&mdash;all in a very enjoyable-to-explore format. However, I realized quickly that the database is all in metric&mdash;which is Greek to most U.S. residents like me. (I left them a suggestion that they might want to at least put in a converter for those of us who just won't get with the metric program.)I'm really looking forward to planting tomatoes in my new Tomato Success Kits, which I can roll out into the sun in front of my apartment (the back's too shady), and I was at first delighted to see all the varieties (114 search hits!) of tomatoes (with great photos) in the database. But one problem immediately presented itself: the database does not include the super-essential (for container gardeners) indeterminate vs. determinate info for the tomatoes, so more research will be required once you've narrowed down your choices. I didn't spend a lot of time in the database looking at other edibles I might plant, but those who have specific veggies or fruits they wish to plant need to check them out to be sure the information they need is included. Of course, I'm sure the monitor itself could care less if a tomato is determinate or indeterminate. It's going to base its information on how much light, water, and fertilizer is there for the plant and also the temperature. It's up to container gardeners to figure out what's going to work in a planting.On the whole, so far I'm really impressed and hope that Android app is out in time for me to use the Flower Power this spring."
77212,"This show is awesome. I loved every episode and was glad to finally find a show that my wife was happy to sit down and watch with me! Everything about this show is spectacular....directing, acting, plot."
77213,"these are pretty handy when troubleshooting, can free up a hand so you don't have to hold both leads to what ever you are checking."
77214,"I actually have five of these for the various instruments, mostly bass guitars but also an acoustic and a solid-body electric.When mounted properly to studs - the only way I have mounted these - they are very, very solid. While in a nice package with instructions and hardware for wall board fasteners, I used longish brass wood screws to studs for appearance and strength. You do see the ends of the screws used after install is complete, and to me a brass screw looks great with this &#34;flat black&#34; model.The CC11 model -- this one -- works well with any kind of guitar including bass or acoustic. There are variants for other instruments, but a relatively wide range will be held securely by this unit. The yoke width is adjustable, and a combination of slope and two keeper rings prevent the instrument from coming off the holder.Recommended...but do consider you means of mounting carefully."
77215,As with any extended series the fringe characters get a lot of development and this is the case here.  Really adds a lot to the series.
77216,"These long cables work fine for my truck, but the quality seems a little on the shabby side. For the money I was not expecting 200 dollar snap-on jumper cables but these seem more like what you would see at a chinese knock off shop like harbor freight for 30 bucks."
77217,"Perhaps the squirrels in my yard have developed a fondness for ""putrescent egg"" or find the allure of bird seed and budding leaves offsets the supposed repellent tastes and odor of ""Deer Off."" I've followed the direction, applied this product twice to the same plants, shrubs, and area. I coated the bird feeders and ground around them with Deer Off, and I also liberally applied it to the aerial access points via tree limbs and trunks, bushes, even stairs.The squirrels remain undeterred. They continue raiding the raised beds, climbing to the bird feeders, and generally seem unperturbed. If they were wearing clothes pins on their noses or had tiny gas masks, then that would be one thing. So I still have to dispatch the Aussies to chase the squirrels when I catch the varmints in the act.This repellent does work during the time I am actually spraying it on stuff to the point it coats surfaces and drips to the surrounding ground. I think, however, that my presence may be the deterrent during those moments of respite from the rodents' continual engorgement."
77218,"i love injecting the meats with a bit of extra flavor or beer to keep them extra moist, but i do prefer a clear tank so i can see how much juice i'm putting. that being said, this is way WAY more sturdy than some other products i've tried and i also enjoy the dual injection options. i can use the straight injector for concentrated flavor or the perforated injector for a wide spread of juice. very well made and durable.~I received a sample product for free in exchange for an honest review~"
77219,I bought this tool to help remove stuck windshield wiper arms from BMW's and it works great. Many models have wedge shaped wiper arm posts that are often difficult to remove the wiper arm. Honestly I have never had a stuck battery terminal that I could not easily remove in my 30+ years of wrenching so I cannot give a performance rating in this area since I have never experienced it. But it looks to be up to the task if needed. I own several quality Lisle tools and this tool is no exception. It is sturdy and well made for the price and its intended purpose. My only beef is that the product does NOT match the stock photo. The center adjustable wedge nut is NOT metal as shown in the picture. It is constructed of a dense plastic albeit a higher quality plastic. But plastic is plastic and sellers should not be allowed to misrepresent products they sell. With that said I was alerted to this beforehand by another Amazon reviewer. The plastic wedge nut does not detract from the tools purpose. This is something I am OK with but must point out that the seller misrepresented the product. That is the only reason I knocked it down one star. Due to many sellers having back-stock there are some that still have the version with the metal wedge nut so this fact could be upsetting for customers expecting the exact product represented in the photo. Kind of like ordering a Made in the USA tool only to receive a Chinese version in the package. Please post an updated product photo or at the very least clearly post a warning that the product received may be different than the one represented in the photo.
77220,"Ultimate shine for a black car!  I am quickly becoming a little OCD when it comes to my black car.  I am new to personal car detailing but have learned a ton from Meguiar's website and youtube.  I washed my car way too many times at the self serve car wash last winter and swirled the heck out of the paint.  I purchased M9 Swirl remover 2.0 and did the car after washing and claying.  This glaze does  exactly what I expected.  It adds depth and really good shine to the paint.  A few have said you can apply this with a machine but it dries so fast I cant see how that would work.  I used a 3 inch applicator and did one panel at a time. I used a very small amount, maybe a nickel sized drop per panel and little goes a long way.  Its suggested to apply this in straight lines and that seemed to work very well.  It dries very quickly, almost crusting over before you finish applying it.  I buffed it off in the opposite direction of the way it was applied and the luster and shine is really incredible.  I used Meguiar's microfiber towels to remove the glaze.  I didn't notice any improvement in hiding the slight blemishes the car still has but the shine is well worth the extra step."
77221,I know that title seems a little dumb but it is only because my I.Q. points definitely take a hit while watching this show.  Sorry but I like it any way.  Seems a little devious to be cheerful about other peoples misfortunes.  Sorry but it is funny sometimes
77222,"Not terribly big, but gives good accuracy when you are trying to pour out of it.  Pretty much a scoop that works like a scoop."
77223,"So yeh, Archer is awesome.  Compared to other seasons 5 does not disappoint.  That said I don't like the &#34;Archer Vice&#34; arc of the season.  I like them having their small business style spy office.Another thing I really don't like is paying Prime and then paying for for a specific show and then getting advertising before and even more ads after the show."
77224,"I have a half dozen Streptocarpus plants, which are flowering houseplants.  I got them from a lady at a farmers market awhile back, and the soil mix that she had used was full of perlite, making it very light.  Strepto culture is about the same as for African Violets, so I purchased some bagged soil mix for violets [without added plant food].  It was somewhat dense, however, and I lost a couple of my smaller streptocarpus plants.  I have since started adding about 20 to 25% Miracle Gro perlite to the mix.  The soil in my pots is light and porous, and so far, my Streps are loving it.  Since the Miracle Gro Perlite contains fertilizer, I do not add any additional plant food.  The doctored soil mix is now very much like what was used in the original plantings that I bought.  I also have a few African Violets, so I think I will repot those with the new mixture very soon.  I recommend this product highly."
77225,"This show is crazy, it is unbelievable how many people marry people that they don't even know.  It is very entertaining."
77226,These picks have just the right amount of give to really make strumming sound nice and clean. Very forgiving on technique also. Great for beginners.
77227,"Microfiber is made from strands/threads that can be 100th the diameter of a human hair. They have a positive charge that actually attracts dust and dirt particles. The fine threads are ultra absorbent and hold 7 times their own weight in fluids. Despite their amazing softness, the tiny, thin fibers shred dirt off surfaces so effectively that they often eliminate the need for any toxic cleaning chemicals.  Around the house they're great for cleaning glass without ammonia, granite countertops without chemicals, or messy sprays to clean wood surfaces.  I have been using these for several years in cleaning, waxing, polishing and detailing my car without the worry of micro scratches and swirls on the paint.  In fact, I don't allow any other type of cloth to touch my car. After washing the car using these, then drying the car using these, then applying wax with these and removing the excess residue, a clean one can be used last to polish the car to a brilliant shine.  Much more effective than terry cloth or conventional rags.  Besides their amazing abilities to do so many things well, it's comforting to know that microfiber is produced from left over waste products of refining petroleum that would normally have found their way into landfills. These sold by Amazon, come in 3 different coolers, so they can be reserved for designated tasks based on their color; the blue ones only to apply products on your car, reserving the whites to remove residue and also polish the surface, and the yellow ones, say for household cleaning applications.  I have bought several orders of this product from Amazon over time, who as usual seem to offer the most value and cannot recommend them highly enough. I'd give 6 stars if I could."
77228,Does the job....helps remove stubborn rad. hoses.  Makes the job that much easier.  A must have for the do it yourselfer
77229,"The picture does not do these chocks justice.  There massive compared to my Sears metal-collapsible chocks.  It has a big footprint, and keep in mind these work great with Race Ramps!  A must for any mechanic."
77230,"I honestly don't know how they can sell these cases for the price and give you free shipping too. I've seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more. This is a hard shell tolex covered case. They are sturdy, well padded with plush black lining, and look as good as cases costing much more. These cases are made for dreadnought guitars, and I bought two of them. One is for my Ibanez AK75G arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly. The case has 4 brass latches and one is lockable and comes with 2 keys. It's made in China, but isn't most everything these days? I wouldn't recommend it for airline/railroad baggage, but this case will offer ample protection and safe storage for your instrument under most other conditions. I don't think you'll find a better deal on a hard shell guitar case anywhere else. Don't be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better. Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by buying one of these great cases!"
77231,while this looks really cool in my jeep noone mentioned that you have to cut these knotches out with a razor knife and its pretty thick plastic and the squares are so close together that its easy to cut into the next block or out side the lines.. i proble would have oredered a dif one but if you have time and are fairly nifty you can def make this look cool just take your time
77232,Key and Peel - that's the number one reason for the 5 star rating.  Loved these guys on MAD TV and were thrilled to find them on Amazon.
77233,"The Great Buck Howard is not a bad film, it is not a great film either. There are some wonderful moments, and then there are the not so wonderful. I really liked John Malkovich, Colin Hanks, Emily Blunt, and Tom Hanks in this film. Then again, I am a total sucker for voice over narration when it adds to the story. And the voice over is done very well, Colin Hanks has a really nice voice.Troy Gable (Colin Hanks - Tom's son) is in law school and hating it. He drops out. Gets hired as The Great Buck Howard's road manager (John Malkovich). The Great Buck Howard is an old school, Johnny Carson era, illusionist. He has his fans in places like Akron, Ohio. The story is told from Troy's viewpoint. He objectively recounts his relationship with The Great Buck Howard, and the road was an interesting one.Where the film didn't work too well for me, I had a hard time figuring out the point. It was a fun interesting trip, Buck Howard is an unusual man; but what did it all mean? A tiny key to the central idea might be the end titles - the story is loosely based on the Amazing Kreskin. Maybe afterall this was just a pleasant story telling of a has been illusionist. There was a love interest that I did enjoy, Troy and Valerie (Emily Blunt). It is worth watching the concert that is played during the credits - there is a sweet surprise at the end.Technically the film was done well. It avoided nonsense handheld cameras with jittery movement. The first half hour is paced really well. The story moves along fairly quickly, but there is a sense that the film is over at the end of this half hour. There was a difficult transition to the road story. I found myself saying, OK, move on, I get it. So the film got a bit slow at 30 minutes to about halfway, 45 minutes. There were a few slow spots here and there later on, otherwise the pacing was better up to the end.There's a ton of cameos in this film. Way too many to list. They didn't enhance or detract from the film.The film is rated PG. Frankly, I don't remember much being objectionable in the film for younger viewers. It just doesn't seem to be a film that younger viewers would enjoy though.Overall, not a bad film. An enjoyable hour and a half."
77234,Exact fit for my 2005 SV650.The instructions were clear - but probably because I watched the other reviewer's video on how to add the battery fluid. No problems encountered on my install.
77235,We spray our vegetables with deer repellent.  Effective but expensive and washes off.We tried motion detection lights.  Worked for a weekWe tried motion detection sprinklers.  Worked but overwatered the garden.We have a five foot high electric fence around our garden.  The deer jump it.We tried the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent.  Worked for a small area but we have a 1/4 acre garden.  We'd need hundreds of dollars worth of these things and the deer could still jump over them.
77236,So nice and super cheaper then one by one at the store's.I like it. I keep it all in my freezer so it stays nice and handy anytime I need one for my bird feeders.
77237,I bought this item to adapt the hitch for a bike carrier and it seems to work well although it seems like just another point for something to go wrong.
77238,"This LED tape light definitely can be called an ""multi-purpose"" light.  I wanted this strip of lights because when the power goes off I want to be able to prepare the quickly prepare my residence for any indeterminate outage.  Flashlights are fine and my Coleman lantern helps, but the LED feature lights up a wider area quickly and easily.Yes, these can be installed in any number of areas, especially in a work situation.  One relative even wanted them to light up a display hutch.  They do take eight AA batteries, which makes the battery pack a bit heavy.  My only problem with this is that the fully loaded pack weighs approximately nine ounces.  The wire connecting to the strip is 5"" leaving me fewer options for permanent installation unless I decide to place it flush on a workshop table or a place where the battery pack can be tucked away without dangling.Do I like this LED tape light?  Actually I love it, save that one picky, minor caveat.  Otherwise I'd give it five stars.  I plan on using it as a portable strip either for inside use or perhaps my occasional outside needs.  Included are instructions for permanent installation, cleaning instructions, and a brief cautionary note on the dangers of looking directly into the light.  I like this better than another strip I have that gets quite hot and would definitely recommend this alternative over the less expensive, but hazardous light strips."
77239,"When I got my parents addicted this show after watching the first episode, they asked how they didn't know this show had been around since '08. Good question. Now that they know of it, they love it. And so does my brother. Oh, yeah... SO DID I! If anyone were to ask me what the show's about, three words suffice- cons conning cons.The main backstory of this show may upset parents who have lost an only child since the leader of this crackteam lost his only child to a hospital operation that wouldn't have worked. The leader knew a procedure that would work, yet his boss didn't go for it, despite the man's loyal work. So, to cope with his losses (child, wife, job, home, etc.), he becomes an alcoholic, and is offered his first job considering what he was when he had a job- an insurance investigator/stealing stolen artifacts. The job should be easy enough, with a gathered crack team of people that normally work alone (a brutal brawler, social actress, cat burglar, and computer hacker), they work together to steal something to bring it back to the owner, and get paid. Done deal. Oh, wait, things are never that simple. Teams gets back together again, and gets revenge. Idea- work together to bring down people who constantly gyp others who are trying to live decent lives and manipulate big-time cons with good social reputations to 'fess up their mess-up, and give people a reason to keep hoping for a better future. And what cons they go after.Manipulating an already-manipulated court session; giving a disabled vet the $ he needs stolen from him for rehab to work again; finding a kidnapped orphan to bring him back (and what a shocking twist that one had halfway through); helping a church keep a reputation and reveal the Judas in the social area; and revert an already botched bank robbery. Oh, don't worry, there's others, and all of them have wit, sarcasm, little moments that make them all the better, and, at times, very evocatively emotional scenes. Towards the end are some very heavy twists dealing with a few characters that dropped my jaw more than once.But it's the last con that did more than become icing on the cake. It was... how did the Klingons say it? Revenge is best served cold? Well, in Nathan Ford's case, the two part finale was a masterpiece all its own and rivaled the technique of so many heist movies that seem to try too hard. This had everything I love in a good drama. The enemies think they know how to outwit the thieves, only for a trip to get tripped and get tripped theirselves. So, I can see why they would leave the best far last. And I couldn't help but cheer with the cast in the special feature that reveals the show being renewed, or laugh with Beth in her own little spoof about her in-show character, or even laugh at the asininity of the deleted scenes. Now to get the 2nd season and continute the laughs and heartfelt emotion."
77240,"I travel all summer. I am dumping tanks a few times a week. I need a disposable glove to keep my hands from getting dirty with waste so I can toss them and get in the truck to drive off to my next stop.These I would not consider nothing more than cheap thin plastic gloves. Baggie sandwich bags would work as good and fit as good. Maybe even work better as baggies dont rip as easy as these. Save your money and the frustration.They dont fit, they rip so easy and usually fall of half way through and are ripped. So I end up having to wash up in the end like I never used any gloves at all.  I would buy good latex gloves that fit snug and wont rip so easily."
77241,"One of the worse things that happened this past spring is that this show got canceled.  The show had an excellent combination of good acting from all of it's prime characters, interesting story lines, fun, and often a meaningful message. It had romance, sex, adventure, thoughtful interaction among it's characters all presented in a  way that kept me interested from begging to end. My hope is that the producers will find another venue, the show will continue, and it will be advertised widely enough that I can find it."
77242,"I was worried that I would find this thing on the floor of my RV after driving with it on my stove for the first time.  I have now taken a few trips and so far it has stuck VERY well.  Actually, it sticks to the grate of the grill so well that the grate comes up when I try to remove the cutting board.  Also, it comes with a nice plastic cutting mat that you can use to protect the beautiful wood surface."
77243,"The little plastic mesh top makes it impossible for the squirrels to lean over the top and get out the seeds without falling, and the birds have no problem picking the seed through the holes. However, this doesn't hold up well in areas with strong winds. We live in the mountains and the winds can be brutal. The feeder went flying with the first hard windstorm and the plastic top is cracked. This would be a great unit for areas that don't have such brutal winds, but won't work out for our area unless I bring it in every time there is wind (which is almost every morning). I do like the design though and how easy this was to put together."
77244,"We've used Corry's and other slug baits. They all kill slugs, but this one is more convenient because of it seems to be more concentrated and require less per square foot. Also, the plastic container is easier to manage for someone of modest hand size vs. the larger boxes.We had a summer rainstorm here, and the product was still killing slugs afterwards.If it's the right price, get it!"
77245,"Keeps gear dry.Not for airplane travel or shipping, but perfect for spare guitars.Zipper works fine; fabric as good as gig bags three times as much."
77246,This is the best cop series I have ever seen. The characters as so original. The stories are are so imaginative and not derivative like so many cop shows.  I hated it when I realized I was watching the last episode.
77247,"Pros:LightweightStack when not in useStainless steel screwsStable cast aluminum base--no rockingCons:None that I can seeI use these to keep the truck camper weight off of the corner jacks when it is in storage. They are lightweight, yet strong enough for my purpose. Just like any cast aluminum, the stands get a layer of corrosion, but that won't hurt their usefulness. The screw supports are stainless and operate easily after 6 months of winter weather."
77248,This is my wife's favorite show. We have a son in-law that is from Louisiana and she pick on him about living in the swamp.
77249,"The ignorance of  burnt out producers and writers  who finally after 40 years of doing heavy drugs, find themselves in a world of film , that requires no talent,..like the music industry, for instance.I usually rely on the Imbd when I pick something to watch, but this is a true  disappointment in that rating system.Surely  , this being a based on a true story and all,..either someone is poking fun at the people of Minnesota, or the words, &#34;based on a true story&#34;  is a joke, as well as this trash they call a story.I tried two episodes and honestly don't understand why there has to be the numbnuttery or Black adder crap  mixed in with a real true drama story,..Sadly , the industry being what it is today , this stupidity will carry into a second season, because the critics  are old LSD burnouts themselves.If it is, .....then say what it is, .....but don't say it is and mean something else.Because there is nothing dramatic about this crap,...and crap is exactly what this is,..I will definitely be  requesting a refund for this waste of money,.."
77250,"I would have given Breaking Bad The Final Season 5 stars. But being that its the last season, it kind of saddens me."
77251,Great grip.Lasts a good long while.Terrific trippy pearl tones and azures.My all time fave. Hip hip hooray.
77252,I bought this for our RV so that the hose can be straight down and not get kinks in it.  Works great.  Would recommend to RV owners.
77253,"very generic, poorly constructed stereotypes. Then and now, I'll bet mobsters didn't talk like that. The cop characters absorbed beatings that would put any citizen in the hospital for weeks. A very unbelievable cartoon of Mob-life .  On the plus side the scenic design and execution with the CGI was great; Very noirish."
77254,one of the best shows out there right now once you watch it once you will be hooked and this season is by far one of there best
77255,"I must be crazy to enjoy this kind of thing.  Um, don't go there.OKay, let's take a look at why I enjoyed it.One: It's a familiar tale.  Hannibal Lector is an old ""evil mind"" and a beloved monster from past movies.  A deeply detailed and rich character whose evil is fascinating to watch unfold in a train wreck kind of way.  And this Hannibal has all the charisma and intricacies of a truly great bad guy.  The actor brings new life to him and in such a way that he feels entirely new and frightening.Two: The series features excellent actors and special effects worthy of a movie set.  It's direction and style is gripping and tense.  It does not matter that we know Lector, Jack and Will already, in this series they look and feel brand new and I am on the edge of my seat waiting to see more of their relationships develop.Three: The case of the week is also just as gripping and different as the perspective of the series offers us.It's a thriller.  A ride.  And even when he uses the oldest cannibal joke in the book, ""I'd love to have you and your wife for dinner,"" Hannibal feels appropriately creepy and alluring.A pleasure to watch and wait for each week."
77256,"this is a simple loop effects pedal which makes awesome quality loops and unlimited dubs.  you can jam for hours with this thing, it's awesome."
77257,"As soon as I completed landscaping my new home, the moles/gophers moved in too. I have been using Exhart spikes, and I think they help, but of course they run on batteries. This Sweeney's is solar powered and is considerably louder than the Exharts. Only time will tell how long the solar system holds up, and how effective it will be in discouraging the varmints.Update Mar 2014.It's quite noisy. Sounds like a distant Vespa horn . To deaden the sound , it has to be buried leaving the solar top flush with the ground. Which is OK until leaves or other debris covers it up. Deprived of sunlight, it stops making the buzzing noise, and you can't find it. I do not have an acceptable solution to this problem."
77258,"The banter between Steve and Danno is up to par. The episodes I have watched so far are good. What I find distracting is at the beginning of each show where Kono and Adam are on the run, Let us hope the writers get back to being full time in Hawaii."
77259,"these wood chunks added a much needed flavor to my ribs.The smoky sweet taste works well with the tangy sauce i usually use on my ribs.All in all happy bellies = happy family,"
77260,"Saved $2.75 over wal-mart and better yet, I did not have to go in the dumpy store and deal with bitter & unattractive wal-mart associates that think wal-mart &#34;owes&#34; them something... oops, sorry, this is a review about the filter; it fits fine and works fine too. This only issue is removing the giant plastic cover and re-attaching it. GM stopped putting these in the Silverado trucks in 2003 or 04, probably cause no one ever changed them (and to make $1.00 more profit per truck). I suggest buying one now."
77261,"I found it entertaining and I also found myself becoming invested in the characters, it will keep you on your toes! What's next is not what you think. Great writing, great cast, well plotted with action, emotion & cliff hangers. This show keeps you on your toes and wanting more. Every week I am excited to see what is going to happen in the next episode."
77262,"One of my favorite chairs, it is great for lounging in the sun room and the flat arms work well for holding a drink."
77263,"I think Tortex / Delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by.Durable, good to gripping surface, easy to identify thicknesses by color.The only way I can think of to improve these would be to replace the black ink logo and script with some sort of raised embossing.Then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better.Take a look at ""Cactus Picks"" to get an idea of what I mean."
77264,"Most of these kind of backflush tank rinsers do not have a gate valve. They simply squirt water up into the tank (or attempt to), by the direction of the nozzle built into the device.However, there is only so far the water can go &#34;upstream&#34; into the holding tank with such a design. A rinser such as this is vastly superior as it includes a gate valve that you can use to block off the water flow.While that might not allow a high-pressure blast of water into the holding tank, and it could eventually overflow the holding tank into your RV if you are not paying attention, it at least rinses the tank better than not having one.I suggest therefore if you are going to use this item, pay close enough attention that you don't overflow the tank."
77265,"Got tired of buying all those little cans for 3+ bucks each, so got this to hookup the 20lb tank I got from Lowe's to my newCuisinart CGG-200 All-Foods 12,000-BTU Portable Outdoor Tabletop Propane Gas Grill.  Works great.  No problems at all.So when grilling at home, we'll be using this.  For camping or tailgating or anything, we'll go with the little cans.It all seems so obvious...so if you're in the same situation - get this and save money.  It works, and you don't need any extra adapters."
77266,"The squirrel shield seems to work well; I hung this feeder just  a few feet from another one that the squirrels are always in and I haven't seen a single one on this unit. That same  shield seems to keep birds from it, too, at least at first. It took about a week and a half before the birds started using this unit, but once they started, they seem to be using it just as much as the one we already had. I think it's because the shield sways and wobbles with every breeze and it was scaring the birds at first.It would be nice if the feeder held more seed; it has to be refilled every day. But at least what it holds is going to birds, not squirrels."
77267,"My spa has lost its glossy luster due to weather and chemicals, so it has a tendency to develop a bit of a scummy waterline despite careful cleaning and treatment.  I did not expect miracles with this product but I was actually quite satisfied. After a few uses the waterline seemed to be less obvious and when in the hottub it felt a bit less slippery.  For the price, a small amount added each time we use the tub seems to be an economical way to ensure the cleanest hottub possible.  Like I said, no miracles, but there is a tangible difference."
77268,"Cosmic Journeys offers viewers with an open mind both scientific  facts, and the latest theories in cosmic evolution. My mind  runs away and ponders how it all began leaving starving for more information."
77269,Extremely easy to use. tunes my soprano and baritone ukelele perfectly! Have used it several times and first battery still has juice.
77270,"As a brand I like Perky-Pet Hummingbird feeders the best this one I have some doubts. It comes in a box and you need to assemble it no instructions included but it is obvious how to do it. My fear was you have to press so hard on the plastic red flowers to snap into the base it would crack, same with the yellow rings. It did go together without cracking. The top that holds the bottle seems to come off too easy I fear if the feeder if full it may fall to the ground. The one thing that really disappointed me is the built in metal hanger is just a tad to long to slide over the shepherds hook without spilling some of the sugar water out onto the ground.Last Summer I read that the red dye is hard on the kidneys of the hummingbirds so I make my own sugar water and they drink it down faster than I can make it. I hope this year adding 2 large feeders it can be a once a week fill and clean. It is early here yet the scout hummers are out as one came to my window 3 times last week where last year I had a window feeder that broke. I do have this one out now but I didn't fill it I do want to make sure my regulars know they can count on food again this year.If the unit does fail I will come back and update my review."
77271,"I've seen the reviews questioning the capacity of this cord, so I'm wondering if maybe there are changes in the cord.  The one I received is marked on the back of the package:""18 gauge wire""""15 Amp Capacity""Now, I'm not an electrician, nor do I pretend to be one.  I don't know that 18G wire is sufficient to carry 15A.  I'll be using this for a small GPS that I mounted up high and I don't want the cord in the windshield."
77272,"For the longest time I've avoided changing the oil on my wife's Camry myself simply because it's so cramped under the car and I could hardly even get my hand in to reach the oil filter, let alone get a traditional filter wrench up there. Well, I finally got sick of paying $85 for Jiffy Lube to change the oil and decided to give this tool a try. Worked like a charm. I popped my 3/8"" drive socket extension onto the back, slide it over the filter, tightened down, and it popped right off without crushing. Couldn't have been any easier. This time around I replaced the filter with a K&N; filter that has the 1-inch nut on top since that's what I'd already bought, but I may start using this tool and traditional K&N; filters in the future just because it was so easy and it'd save me about $3 a filter.If you've never spent more than 5 seconds trying to loosen an oil filter, do yourself a favor and get this. It'll literally be that quick."
77273,This show was a nice surprise. The story lines are interesting and the characters and story have depth. Very interesting
77274,These mic stands worked perfectly.  The fold down pretty small so you could fit a couple of them in most travel bags.  Easy to adjust.
77275,I had a cheap blow gun in the garage that split when I tightened the fitting too much. This blow gun is very well made and should last a lifetime.
77276,Love the bubble guppies. My kids have learned so much from this show and the songs are catchy but not irritating.
77277,"I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers...the construction of this waterer is pretty flimsy. I'm not too keen on how the saucer connects to the bottom part of the container. If you don't put it together just right, the saucer will fall off when the weight of the water hits it. Other reviewers have stated that the waterer is empty over night. I have a feeling that's due to the issue I just mentioned; it's difficult to get it attached properly and I think the water just drains out. When I DO get it right, it works fine. Also due to its lightweight material, it will sway and empty more quickly on windy days.I like the capacity. I've seen up to four birds (finches, wrens, black capped chickadees...smaller birds) sit and drink from it. I've not seen anyone try to bathe in it yet:) ~ bought this specifically for my front yard. I have a feeder or two that I want to keep the birds at. However they tend to go to our back feeders, where our birdbath is located. I thought this would do the trick to keep some birds in front and some birds in back. It suits my purpose. All in all, it's okay, but I think they construction could have used a bit more thought/common sense, and I don't believe it would have increased the cost by much, if at all. I forgot to mention, it does clean up easily."
77278,"This show is about the characters in the story as much or more than it's about the plot.  This in spite of the fact that it is, in some places, a bit more sympathetic to the main Soviet characters.  You can't help routing for them as they continue their killing spree of those who get in the way of their schemes.  On the other hand, you want them to get caught, because they are the bad guy misled and brainswashed on an evil agenda.  So you wind up rooting for both sides.  Meanwhile, the direction and cinematography are outstanding.  It's just a really well done show with excellent story writing."
77279,"Way too cute, easy to apply and has stayed on though weather with no problem so far. It looks like it is a piece of tap you put on the mirror but you rub the tape and the letters stick to the mirror and you gently pull the tap off and letters stay. I have had no problem with them staying on.  Be sure to rub really, really well to get the letters to stick or they will pull off with the tape. Also pull the tape off slowly. If the letter hadn't stuck to the mirror you can rub it again to be sure it does before you continue to pull the tap off.  Its not really as tricky as I make it sound.Its true too, Objects in the mirror ARE losing!"
77280,"I have tried two of these hoses at this point....first of all I would like to say that they do indeed work as advertised.  When no water is running to them they can be made very compact and stored almost in a cargo shorts pocket space...when you turn the water on you get a nice thin, lightweight 50ft hose.  All great...  Rumford even includes a carrying pouch so you can store the hose when not in use.I started using these as someone normally would...for light duty yard work, cleaning the deck, etc....nothing major.  The hose was always around a wooden deck or a soil filled flower bed...never near brick or concrete.  The first hose ripped after about 3 weeks and the Rumford after about 4 weeks.  Disappointing.It should be duly noted that I live in a home that has WELL water with very little pressure.  Yes it was enough to expand this hose...but not enough to make it rip apart.Personally I feel that this is a great product that may need a bit more work before I would recommend it.  I give it 2 stars because it does work and because Rumford is the only company that includes a carrying pouch.2/5...."
77281,"I've used this weeks upon weeks for cleaning my car, as well as my family members' cars.This soap produces nice soapy bubbles, and you don't need all that much for a full bucket of water. It's a good price as well, for the amount of soap you use per bucket (2-4 quarter sized drops).You're welcome to ask any detailer (I personally have) and they say that they even sometimes use this when their professional soap isn't available!It's not magic by any means, but it won't strip your paint of protectant or wax like dish soap (Dawn, etc) can.I'd highly recommend this to others, and would buy it again."
77282,"I was a little concerned after reader some of the reviews here, but the warranty, Blue's reputation, and Amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try. And in general, I'm pretty satisfied with it. Using it with one of my Oktava MK-301 microphones I get excellent sound, no hum, and so far, excellent reliability. I'm using it with Audacity and a few other programs, none of which have any difficulty recognizing it. There were some issues setting it up initially, and I'm a bit leery about the plastic construction, but for what I paid I think it's a good value. For those thinking of using it in field recording- stick it inside a carrying bag, and tape the cable to it to prevent stressing the USB connector. You shouldn't have any problems."
77283,"Good, solid cast, obviously he has issues from his childhood, the trial story is a bit lame the plaintiff obviously can't afford money lawyer and I doubt she's doing this pro-bono.  The family had to have known he was a pervert,  so there just out for money, makes it look to typical and stereo type.Now for his on going cases that's where you got my interest, work with that."
77284,"The characters in this show are very interesting, the story is full of excitement, and surpring at time too. We love this series!!"
77285,"After years of being an idiot and trying to gently use my fingers to prevent my door from scraping on the wall of my car port, I bought this. Works exactly like it should... by being a barrier between my door and the wall. The thickness is perfect. It could stand to be a little longer for my inaccurate parking jobs... but very good nonetheless. Even has two holes cut out so you can drill the sucker into a wall if need be.Note: The vinyl tape that it says is frequently purchased with this product will not work on a textured (stucco) wall."
77286,This Prime series is off to a grand start and I can't wait for further episodes. Yes I think you should continue this series.
77287,This liquid wax really brings out the shine and is very easy to apply and wipe off. I use it on my chrome wheels and it makes them look brand new.
77288,"Good solid construction. It hooks onto the mic stand and works as advertised, i.e removes the pops from vocal recordings."

77290,I got this becasue our bassist got his hands on one and loved it.  I have a stompbox tuner but this Shark is really fantastic.Easy to use and very accurate.  It makes tuning a breeze.
77291,"Live Another Day was promoted as having a different story arc. I had every expectation of liking the new version. With one tie in, from a previous season, I had hoped for change. Jack is Jack. He's eternally loyal and capable of doing the impossible. The problem arose when it became obvious there was no real change. New location. New characters. But same story line.I realize 24 is not remotely plausible in a lot of ways. As a drama, it does have to relate to its viewers in specific ways. I can no longer suspend disbelief. Jack is past the point of hug me jacket and happy meds.If I'm watching another season, it better have something better than a failed promise of new material."
77292,"The actor who plays Louis Litt is just awful.  He's a lousy actor, and he's truly unattractive.  No tv show would have a female principal character who is this ugly and one dimensional.  Why do viewers have to endure such lousy casting and acting when the character is male?"
77293,"Love Bramwell, Love Downton Abbey, love most BBC period pieced made before 2000, but the bouncing camera and garbled dialog made this one unwatchable. Is it really necessary to shake the camera around all the time? Without subtitles, this one is hopeless."
77294,Great gear! Put the D-rings on the bumpers and used all of the gear just to run it through some testing not only to put the gear through it's paces but also to get me familiar with their uses. I like the kit!
77295,"I usually wait a while to watch a new series until I know whether it's been renewed or cancelled.  This was cancelled yesterday, May 9th (along with my favorite sitcom Community).  I watched quite a few episodes, and it's bad.  Even by JJ Abrams standards, though it's not as bad as Revolution.The plot is as follows:  The girl (Bo) has psychic abilities off the charts and she was 'rescued' from a government project that may have been trying to develop her as a weapon.  Bo's ""rescuers"" reunite her with her dad, who was on death row.  The reason he was on death row was completely resolved half a dozen episodes later.  The evil director of the facility that was studying Bo wants her back and they enlist the FBI-- the sole presence of which is a youngish brunette in a pony tail.  That's the back story.In nearly every episode:1.  Their safe house gets compromised and they have to flee2.  Bo gets a vision about a normal person who needs help.  She tugs and tugs on her father's arm until he gives in.. reluctantly.3.  The 'bad guys' enlist a psychic to find her or turn on a psychic machine that reads psychic emissions (wtf?)4.  Bo and her dad hug the people they save5.  The bad guys are shown to have another ace up their sleeveThey state at the onset that Bo needs a normal childhood because she is so powerful she could bring peace to the world.  However, nobody shows a trace of growth.  Every person's personality is completely fixed and no experience changes anyone, even slightly.JJ Abrams isn't even trying anymore.  He comes up with a plot (this time shamelessly ripped off from Touch), and cranks out a dozen poorly thought out episodes before being handed another series (and the reins to both Star Trek and Star Wars).  When I see JJ Abrams name on a series, I know I'm getting a polished turd.  I feel like I spent more time on my review than JJ Abrams did with the series.And from certain angles, that girl is a dead ringer for a skinny Honey Boo Boo."
77296,Great show I am almost always laughing at the things they do and some are stupid but none the less pee my pants funny
77297,GIVES YOU THAT EXTRA 5 FEET YOU NEED  GREAT...CAN SET MY LAPTOP ON MY BENCH INSTED OF BENDING OVER IN CAR WITH A BAD BACK.
77298,"And NOVA is always worth watching.  With a few seasons of NOVA, you will be a better educated, better informed person [and so will your children], and you will have that painlessly and in an entertaining way.  As a scientist, I rarely find fault with the information NOVA presents."
77299,"It seems that only the last two episodes of the second half of series seven were worthy of applause. The others just didn't seem as great, very little of Clara, if anything, was actually explained until the last episode. It feels like the doctor would only keep wondering to himself who Clara was and then try to hide that fact from Clara; and while Clara was a nice companion she never really seemed to grow on me. I mean she's cute and all but was she ever really needed beyond 1 or two episodes? SHE WAS ALMOST LIKE AND EQUAL AND NEVER REALLY CHALLENGED THE DOCTOR."
77300,Put the wax on and use your cordless drill and follow the instructions.I take the big stuff off with the ball and drill and them come back with a microfiber rag and the shine is ON!If you want a super shine you can go to the local hog dealer and get some of their paste wax which is the BEST overall wax I have ever used.Cars and motorcycles and trucks. Pricey but the hog wax is worth it.Finish with Mother's FX and you got a shine that you can see your teeth in.The ball is washable and that was an issue. Check the net for info on that.
77301,"I like it, this season is entertaining but I'm not really hooked yet.  I will continue watching the seasons because I understand that season 3 will be really great.  I hope so because I do like the characters and the story line."
77302,"I am shocked this has a low amount of ratings yet bosch has tons and it is just another cop drama show which we are over run with. I personally don't get peoples obsession with cop/detective/csi shows. moving on This is a fantastic show about things that really happen, and families real life situations. I love true to life, bare bones raw shows that are well acted like this show! Very well written and acted and directed!!!! I would watch this waiting for each episode to be posted on Amazon Instant video, A must make series ."
77303,"I wish I learned more about the English monarchy back in the day when I was in school. I may not have been interested back then but I am now. Learning more about these events and a possible storyline, fictional I'm sure, does make it entertaining. What more can I ask from a TV series?"
77304,"Dirt box gold for under 50 bucks! Highly adjustable tone, volume and distortion level that won't tank your amplifier tone, while letting you get between everything from back alley blues to blistering metal. I love this pedal!!! The true bypass is a bonus if you are in love with your amp's tone, but lose it when you engage your pedal. Not anymore. I know there are some great distortion pedals on the market, but you won't find this quality and tone at a better price. Joyo win.Sorry OS-2 - it's pawnshop time for you!"
77305,"I have had a Korg CA-30 tuner for a few years which I really like.I wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unit.Initially I bought a Boss TU-80 for more money, but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the Korg TM-40,and the batteries rattled around in their compartment.Also I like having the middle green LED for tuning.The price here can't be beat and it's a well built item that works great.I was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much, but they take more pressure that it would seem, and there is a delay until it turns on or off, so that turned out not to be an issue.I am not real hot for the color, but it's nicely made and works well, so I will live with it.I especially like the little folding stand in the back, rather than having to find an old credit card."
77306,We didn't have much counter space in our camper. This worked out great! Looks good and gives us another place to set items when we aren't using the stove. Rubber bumpers/feet keep the unit from rattling and the whole thing just folds behind the stove when you need to cook. Cheaper on Amazon than at Camping World at the time.
77307,Love this show. Love every character. These are seasons that will be great to watch over and over for fans of the show.
77308,"The Obolus in nothing that you'd think it is. Without giving too much away, it's about a journey that we all must take. It's only about 20 minutes so everyone can find time to watch it ... you won't be disappointed."
77309,This is very heavy so when it arrives at your door and you have to bring it inside you will know that you did something. Buy a bench get a free workout.Very solid construction. My box was not damaged so most parts went together pretty easy. A rubber mallet is always good to have to smack stubborn parts together. This will last for a long time and makes your garage or even a big closet look organized and stylish. Downside is it makes the rest of your storage solutions look like crap.
77310,I watch many series and feel Parenthood to be the only one that shows a real multi generational family in the truest sense.
77311,"Great product ! It has a soft smell, very use to apply and remove. The interior of my car is fantastic !!!"
77312,"I have only used this once, but, it worked really well.  It was simple to use and the pressure was just right."
77313,"Chrome wheels are nice looking, but they are open to collect black brake dust.  The cleaner which is made in Germany is just sprayed on the wheels.  It turns from green to red indicating it is time to wash the liquid off.  I give the cleaner help with a wheel brush and then spray the cleaner off with a hose.  The chrome wheels look very good when finished."
77314,"I have yet to catch a hummingbird at this feeder, but I love it just the same as a practical ornament for my flower garden. The glass is beautiful and looks expensive. Plus it's easy to fill.There are lots bees and yellow jackets in my garden, but the feeder's red flowers keep them away. I'm looking forward to the day the hummingbirds discover this feeder; until then, it's a great garden piece for visual interest."
77315,the  amazon brand  if  half the price  of  the  &#34;big guys&#34; .. works  awesome  .. I have  a jeep  that  never  has  a top on it ..  on those cold  days  these  things  make  a BIG  difference
77316,"So I deeply enjoy Eureka, so finding out that these two stories were linked was a delight. I'm so upset that the final season in a brief 5th season (which I haven't seen yet), but I liked the story enough to buy the 4th season after finishing the first 3 on Netflix. Quirky, emotional, fun."
77317,I like this show but it only lasted one season so no reason to get to invested in it. But it was a fairly good show.
77318,"Although it's a bit too gruesome at times, I find this series awesome in it's writing.  I get drawn in each episode!"
77319,"This show is a disappointing production overall. Story, acting, singing, and direction all pretty bad.  How do you make Bebe Neuwirth look bad?  She is an amazing singer/actor and she couldn't shine in this terrible production."
77320,"The Poirot of later years is not so nice.  He is sanctimonious, preachy, judgmental and prone to rattling his rosary beads.  I miss the funny and charming Poirot of earlier seasons.  Nevertheless the programs are entertaining and worth watching.  The supporting casts continue to be superb and the scenery and period details delightful."
77321,"I bought a set of these for my fogs in 5K to match my 5K headlights. The bulbs are purple, like 12K. Not really what I expected unless the bulbs were mislabeled from the factory and are actually 12k. I bought a set of these in 6K for another car and the color temp on those were spot on. These are good bulbs, I think I may have just gotten the wrong product for what I ordered.UPDATE - Kensun customer service has made an attempt to correct this issue by sending me a set of bulbs from a newer batch. I installed the replacement bulbs and while one bulb is finally spot on at 5K, the other bulb still exhibits a very noticeable purple hue. I swapped ballasts to rule out the possibility of a bad ballast, but the issue still remains. I have informed the vendor of the issue and am awaiting further advice.UPDATE 1/2/2014 - Jack from Kensun is continuing to work with getting me a matching pair of bulbs. Customer service has been a 5 star experience as the vendor is continuing to work with me until the issue is resolved.UPDATE 1/7/2014 - After a third set of replacement bulbs, the color of the bulbs are finally spot on. Not sure what the problem is with the 5K bulbs as I have a set of these bulbs in 6K and didn't have any issues with my 6K's. Customer service went out of their way to make things right, but perhaps the manufacturer should be advised to improve their level of QC on their bulbs."
77322,"I initially had a black colored one, because I thought that would be more &#34;cool.&#34;  But I lost it.  So now I get brighter colored ones.  Gripe: a rubber thingy on the bottom of the clip came off while performing, and I have not been able to find it.  It still works, but that's a design flaw.  Also, don't leave it attached to any fine guitar, because it, like capos, can permanently damage the finish of  a really fine guitar.  but it works well, and the batteries seem to last."
77323,I liked it but found it hard to pull for the Russians.  There were several unexpected twists which make the future more exciting.
77324,GREAT SERIES THAT YOU CAN SEE WHEN THERE IS NOTHING ON TV.  PIPER SEEMS TO BE GETTING MORE INTERESTING EACH SEASON.
77325,"This works better than the other brand I used before. All the renewals seem to do a good job, but reoxidize w/i 6 months. After this last time, I bought kevlar headlight adhesive sheets-$30 on Amazon. These are available cut specifically to the size of headlights and driving lights of auto."
77326,"Many people have compared this offshoot of the Stargate franchise as a Battlestar Galactica wannabe. Since I've never seen the newest BSG series, I can't compare it myself. So, I'll just say that I loved this newest SG installment and wish that it hadn't been cancelled after Season 2. However, even though it was cancelled, it was just so much fun. Now, the stars are off doing other series. However, if I ever win the Lotto, I will personally fund a TV movie or another season of this show. I miss the characters and would like to see them again."
77327,"Three former high school friends Regan (Kirsten Dunst), Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and Katie (Isla Fisher) are shocked when they learn that another high school friend of theirs Becky (Rebel Wilson) is getting married. On the day before her wedding, the three girls rip the wedding dress and have to fix it. (But why do they have to fix it? If they are really mean and self-centered, as the film shows, why not hide it and pretend they don't know anything about it?)That the main characters of ""Bachelorette"" are all mean-spirited and selfish didn't bother me. I enjoyed watching ""Carnage"" and to a lesser degree ""Young Adult."" In making comedies and dramas, you don't have to make your characters sweet or likable as long as they are interesting or funny, and more importantly, believable, to sustain the film's running time. That does not happen in ""Bachelorette.""The characters are honest to the point of being totally nasty. That is fine, as being nasty is not mutually exclusive to being funny or even attractive. The problem is the story is not only unconvincing, but is uninteresting. Characters are not fleshed out. Drug/sex-related jokes are clich&eacute;d. There is some smart dialogue, and the talented cast gives their all, but sometimes it seems writer/director Leslye Headland just doesn't know what she wants them to do.While watching the uneven mid-part of the film, I expected these girls to raise much more hell. That didn't happen. Jokes and crude remarks, themselves alarmingly real, may work as a sketch, but a feature movie needs more than that."
77328,"It looks like some of the footage is very poor standard definition quality (like bad cell phone video quality) spliced into other footage that is HD. Some of the worst video quality I have seen on Amazon. However, the content is great and it represents the parks really well. Lots of interesting information."
77329,"Mixed this with some water, and watered my girlfriends plant that keeps lilting in the summer heat.  Boing!  Now, it only needs to be watered once every 4 days to prevent lilting instead of twice a day.  Plus, the leaves are more vibrant and it's reflowering.  Good stuff!"
77330,"For the most part, this is a well built/durable gig bag. I only rated it at 3 stars for the lack of padding. If you need a protective cover for your guitar then this gig bag is for you. If you want something to protect your guitar from bumps and bangs get a more expensive gig bag with more padding or spend the cash on a good hard case. Remember, you get what you pay for and this is a perfect example of that."
77331,For the price this spreader works fine for yards. It is a little small and requires frequent fillings though. Good pricing.
77332,For the price these can't be beat. At this price it doesn't hurt to have a spare one or two on hand for the inevitable emergency
77333,"I&#8217;m just going to be honest with everyone for a minute.  If I was walking alone on a road in the dead of night and a white van that looked suspiciously like the ones child molesters and rapists drive pulled up alongside me and it was revealed that Scarlett Johansson was behind the wheel, dressed like a prostitute, and she began to inquire about my home life, where I was from, if I lived with anyone (that sort of thing) and then she offered me a lift and we wound up back at her place, I would pretty much know that I was about to die and yet I would still readily walk inside, take off all my clothes, and strut my stuff.It&#8217;s Scarlett Johansson.  You don&#8217;t say no; ever.All joking aside, the above paragraph is pretty much what happens for the first half of this film and yet for some reason it still works in a way that completely entranced me and has me thinking that I&#8217;ve finally seen the first REAL masterpiece of 2014.This has been a long time coming for me.  There were so many things riding on the success of this film, at least for this film lover.  First, you had the return of Jonathon Glazer.  The man has produced two films since his debut, &#8216;Sexy Beast&#8217;, in 2001, and while I don&#8217;t think that &#8216;Birth&#8217; (his sophomore film) was the outstanding masterpiece everyone calls it, the atmosphere he created and honest potential he displayed was undeniable.  I&#8217;ve been craving more from him for TEN YEARS and yet he merely teased us with this film for the last two years, promising it to us and yet withholding it until now.  Second was the inevitable return of Scarlett Johansson to the good graces of the cinephile community.  I love this girl, and back in 2003 I christened her the best new thing to happen to cinema.  Then she became a sex symbol and the world forgot she could act.  She&#8217;s been steadily proving her chops over the past two years, and this panicle of awesomeness has finally pushed her back over the edge.You can&#8217;t deny her talent any longer.But, above all else, I just really wanted &#8216;Under the Skin&#8217; to be a great movie.  Isn&#8217;t that the most we can ask of any film; to be good?  I have not read the novel, although it&#8217;s been on my shelf since 2011, when I first heard that this film was in the making, but I have heard nothing but stellar things for it.  In fact, I&#8217;ve heard that the novel was such a defining moment in the genre that many fans were afraid it was unfilmable.It appears that Glazer doesn&#8217;t know what that means.I think the first thing to understand about &#8216;Under the Skin&#8217; going in is that the film kind of defies formulaic plot structure.  It isn&#8217;t a linier story in the sense that you may expect.  It does have a clear beginning and end, but the middle kind of goes in and out of a direct storyline, and rightfully so.  The film&#8217;s clear intent on developing a dreamy, otherworldly atmosphere, is key to the development of the themes presented, and without them this would have fallen into the genre traps the keep so many other films grounded in a place of mediocrity.  Instead, Glazer flips us all the bird and constructs something that feels like David Lynch attempting to make a Terrence Malick film.  It is stunning to look at, independent of dialog (as in, it doesn&#8217;t need it even though it has some), richly spiritual and absolutely insane.To sit here and try and uncover all of the tasty tidbits produced by this film would take all day and be somewhat counterproductive, since so much of the understanding and appreciation of the film comes from that subjective light that we as cinephiles call our opinions, but I wanted to express one aspect of the film that I found to be a beacon shining over what were by expectations.&#8216;Under the Skin&#8217; says a lot about human nature without ever once telling us a thing about it, if that makes sense.  Instead of resorting to those James Cameron force-fed clich&eacute;s of &#8216;HUMANS RUIN EVERYTHING SO ALIENS MUST INTERVENE&#8217;, Glazer allows the visual identity of his film to tell his story for him.  In the development of character in his protagonist (antagonist?), the seductive alien (no one in this film has a name), we see a creature with a purpose who acts like a machine, without sympathy or any real emotion whatsoever, who is betrayed by her own mission when she starts to observe the people around her and become transfixed by the potential for good in humans.  It is through this observance that her guard is weakened and she is won over by her prey and eventually disregards her own journey for another path entirely, only to find out that nothing is black and white.The finale is a jarring look at how we can condemn ourselves through an act of ignorance.This year has been so rich with films that develop complex themes through a subtle air and craft such through provoking tales that leave us all grasping for different answers, showing how important and how impactful film (and storytelling) can be.  &#8216;Enemy&#8217;, &#8216;Noah&#8217;, &#8216;Under the Skin&#8217;; three vastly different films with VERY different stories that all prove that less is more and nothing is what it seems.People will be talking about this movie for years to come, and rightfully so."
77334,"When 'The Newsroom' was first announced, it was reported to be Aaron Sorkin's take on a late night comedy news show, similar to 'The Colbert Report' or 'The Daily Show.' Instead what we got was something preachy, obnoxious, and in love with the smell of its own farts.'The Onion News Empire' is what I wanted 'The Newsroom' to be. It's clever, witty, smartly-written, has some instantly likeable characters, and oh yeah, it's funny as hell. Also, I loved Malcolm in the Middle growing up and am thrilled to see Francais again. Can't wait for more episodes!"
77335,so far. I've machine washed and dried it(just until slightly dampon low heat) twice. It's held up. I've used it once and was impressedby the amount of water it holds and is still able to dry my mid size SUV.I think I squeezed it out 2 or 3 times during the drying process. Lovethe large size. I would buy it again. A great value IMO.
77336,Love Duck Dynasty. Wholesome show. Totally fun to watch. Appropriate for kids. Makes me want to go outdoors and hike more
77337,I had a little dificulty learning how to tune it at the beginning but after i played with it enough i figured it out and its so easy to use and my friends love it they say s*** im gonna by me one lol
77338,"Here in Houston I go through one of these reels every 3 years give or take a bit. What happens is the central support for the wheel simply snaps and the reel then hangs at an odd angle. Soon, it will just fall off. At least it gives a bit of warning.Examining the carcasses of my dead reels I've learned that the plastic bleaches in the sun and the heat and then becomes brittle. It just crumbles. If the reel is full of hose, that extra weight doesn't help much either.I'm going to try knocking back to just 50 feet of hose instead of the full reel of hose. My experienced guess is that will work  better. Also I'll spray some UV protectant on the hub before I mount the reel. That may help.So why do I keep buying these if they don't last too long? Well, for one I've got my holes drilled in the brick and I really like just being able to slap the new unit in place of the old one without drilling even more holes for some new reel which may or may not last any longer than this one. Also, I don't see where anybody makes a side winding reel that is that much better than this one for the price at this time."
77339,"I enjoyed it but as before, the slow pace seems stilted.  Perhaps the point is that investigating such crimes are often like this and I appreciate this fact but I do prefer drama's with characters who fill in the tedium with good dialogue and good characterizations.  I found this season an improvement over last season."
77340,"I love the Dunlop Formula 65 polish and cleaner. It works really well, and I like the easy to use pump spray mechanism. I've used other brands in the past, and they had poor spray nozzles. This one works almost like a mist. It does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints. I spray it directly on the surface of the guitar, and then wipe it off with a flannel cloth. After I'm done the shine looks glassy and great!"
77341,"Mutant Chronicles is an entertaining and well produced movie that has Sci-Fi, Steam-Punk, Zombie, horror, and Post-Apocalyptic elements. This was a lot more enjoyable than I expected it to be.No plot spoilers from me; the movie's back story is a little weak, but it doesn't really detract much from the movie as there are hints (both verbal and visual) that help to fill in some of the questions. Once the action starts, it is fairly easy to get into the story. The world of the 2700s is divided into four corporate blocks, each fighting to control the few remaining resources of the planet. This is literal fighting with armies battling the old fashioned way, which leads to a very surrealistic opening scene. The story follows a band of soldiers who attempt a last ditch effort to save the earth from zombie like mutants that the fighting has inadvertently unleashed. There really isn't any subplot and there is minimal character development beyond what's needed to build some viewer rapport with the main heroes.The fighting action is very good and the special effects are decent enough to sell the futuristic steam-punk technology. The outstanding cinematography uses effective camera angles, lighting, and desaturated colors (except on the blood and certain uniform colors) to enhance the mood and feel of the very gritty environment.This was a very watchable movie that crosses quite a few genres, but if you like zombie\monster movies, then you will likely like this one as well. There is also a possible hook for a sequel.Recommended!"
77342,We installed this LITTLE trash can on the wall in our TT bathroom.  It fits nice in the small space.  Good for putting things you don't want to go down the Lav.
77343,"Bosch is ruined but not beyond hope; hope at least that he will always do what's best. This first episode shows that he might even go for the greater good. Great acting, great story. I was disappointed when it ended because I wanted to keep knowing what was going to happen with each and every character.I can't wait to see Bosch righted and all those bad people and mean cops wronged. I just want the good guy to win. Always."
77344,"I use this to wash cars.  So far so good.  Durable constriction and nice adjustability using the sliding pin.  Ive used Zip wax, Megs NXT wash, and other car washes and they all foam up nicely.  Add a few ounces of wash in the container with water so you dont spray away all your carwash so quickly."
77345,"The nut on the end of the filter makes it easy to install/remove since there is such a tight fit with the sensor located on the engine where it is.  Of course, K&N makes great products with excellent filtering too."
77346,"Has suspense without all the mayhem. Well done, good characters. However, Amazon has again given you the first season but then charges for the rest of the seasons."
77347,"A bit tough to insert the key into the hole as the towing light outlet on the left is partly in the way.  It's manageable to lock and unlock, but you have to do it at a slight angle and/or wiggle it in.  The black makes it look hidden and matches nice."
77348,This is a great show!  Funny and cool and imaginative!!  It has great characters too!  I can't wait to see what happens next!!
77349,Just as i hoped - this is a fantastic buy - did not leak and is working well so far. Just get it. Small reminder that 25 feet is a small length.
77350,"Works great and accurate, the refresh rate isn't bad for the live data feed."
77351,"I always buy a few hoses, two 10 footers and a 15 ft hose. I then connect together the best combination lenth hose that will get from water source to RV. Keeps my camp area neat, plus why on hot days would I want the sun heat the water in the hose and have to wait for the water to get cool by running it. Just makes more sense adding what ya need together then 30 ft of hose sprawel out on your camp site. Most campsites you will end up using the 15 footer anyway."
77352,"I put this feeder out for use on the rail of my decking. We love to watch all the birds come back for the spring and summer and anything we can put out to entice them is all for the better.What I liked about this Waterer:1. It is large enough (64 oz.) so I don't have to fill it constantly but small enough not to be overly heavy.2. It is easy to fill.3. It is plastic but on the sturdy side.4. It is pretty nondescript, so I doesn't present any decorating challenges. (Hey, when we can finally use the deck I like it to look nice out there alright?!)5. When you fill it the water comes slowly out of the base giving you time to get it in place before dealing with a disc of open sloshing water.Drawbacks:1. I am really not sure that this would stay full any length of time if I tried to hang it in a tree, we have enough winds around here that I think most of the water would be on the ground in pretty short order.2. From other comments, I think I lucked out and got a good waterer, looks like there are some quality concerns, so be aware, I can only review the item I received but consumers should be aware of potential quality issues.Recommended with above reservations."
77353,"Being a fan of Betty White's, I'm happy that they brought my beloved Golden Girl to the show.  She makes an excellent, crazy, and horrifying witch lady.  I hope I've seen all the episodes now.  I recall a few months earlier when I was surfing TV late night when I saw Betty White in the description for this show.  I've been hooked on it ever since.  TBS re-aired the episode, so hopefully I'm now all caught up.  Too bad that the show was cancelled fairly early on.  I really did like the simple lessons that Earl gave.Honorable mention: I love Nescobar-A-Lop-Lop name.  It always puts a smile on my face.Earl is just as naive as ever in this episode.Joy is just as bitchy as ever.Darnel is just as ""nice"" as ever.Randy is just as simple as ever.Kenny is just as gay as ever.Catalina is just as cuckoo as ever.and ex-deputy Mike is just as lackadaisical as ever.I love the creativity of the writers - this show is hilarious with all the funny flashbacks.  Don't drink the tea!"
77354,"i used to go to Auto Zone and have any code read....... for $20 I bought this from amazon and it's worked on my 96 chevrolet ,2k dodge caravan and 02 Nissan , also checked a lot of neighbors cars/trucks....well worth the $20.  Unit reads and clears codes.... sure it only gives you the code ...you can look the code number up on the internet... saved me a lot of time and guessing. this unit is all you need to see whats wrong and clear the codes...."
77355,I like the wheel and tire protection and good looks on my Travel Trailer. Easy to install and remove . . .
77356,"This is a fun adult fairy tale.  It is a wonderful representation of the cliche &#34;Wolves in Sheep's clothing.&#34;  Many people hide their darker selves behind their human faces.  This series just emphasizes that in a very graphic way.  It is fun and I enjoy the relationships, especially Grimm's buddy and his girlfriend.  Grimm's own girlfriend is an oddity, but perhaps her character is awash in confusion.  She doesn't seem to get it, even after it is explained to her."
77357,"I just watched the pilot episode for SupaNatural and I have to say if Amazon doesn't turn this into a full-blown TV show I am going to find the crystal skull and play Junk Dick to activate it. So there! For those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about SupaNatural is a parody in response to the glut of TV shows that now feature supernatural happenings. It also pokes fun at the world of pop culture and features two young women who take things in stride that would send most women and more than few men shrieking for their mommies. For instance in one scene a giant spider menaces the girls until fierce blonde bestie Lucretia calmly whips out a tiny can of something, spritzes it in the spider's face and walks away with a ""Spider puh-leeze"" comment as the giant bug keels over. Lucretia was officially my new hero from that moment.The show is about Lucretia and Hezbeh, two besties who take the supernatural all in stride while they try to find love, save the world from evil crystal skulls and keep their dead-end jobs at the mall. While the whole ""oh no, she din't"" thing gets laid on a bit thick at times there are so many hilarious moments and one-liners in the pilot that I didn't mind. I was hooked the minute I was treated to the two girls walking through an ancient temple casually bobbing and ducking under, over and around the usual Indiana Jones-style traps while they discuss things all roommates face such as not bringing weird people home to the apartment and how inappropriate it is to go through your BFF's phone to bust her on sexting a poltergeist. Lucretia and Hezbeh are there to fetch a crystal skull artifact that the Pope himself has hired the girls to retrieve, so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Trouble is the Pope's check for the girls' troubles bounce, so they keep the skull which they soon learn is a loud-mouthed, rude doomsday device whose main demand throughout the show is to ""Place me in the portal and commence Armegedon!""While deactivating the skull is no biggie keeping him switched off is alot harder since he happens to be activated by a tune that unfortunately has shown up in a number one hit song titled ""Junk Dick"" that keeps being played on the mall's muzak system and is everyone's cell phone ring. Priceless one liners ensue. When Lucretia discovers the skull is up and running her first comment is, ""Oh mah God, the skull is on. That's bad!"" Then her eyes wander to a nearby sale sign in a shop window, ""75 percent off? That's good!"" Right after that she glances over at kiosk hot dog stand. ""Free corndogs? This day is craaazy!"" I laughed at that and laughed even harder when she later shows up with a corndog in one hand that she uses to shut the skull up with after she weries of its rants to end the world. The girls do save the day, but not before a few demons escape, Hezbeh gets fired from her job, and a cute annoying coworker ends up getting trashed on Margaritas and manipulated by said skull.Basically this show is a sly poke at pop culture with a dash of adult humor mixed in. Warning--just because it's animated does not mean it's a kid's show. There are plenty of sex jokes and references to drinking and other activities your mom definitely would not approve of, so make sure the kids do not see this on your Kindle or computer or they're going to get an earful now and again.However, if like me you have a twisted sense of humor and love all things parody and satire this show is one to add to your collection. The fact that it features two strong female leads who are real women rather than Buffy-perfect pretty people doesn't hurt my feelings either. Let's face it Lucretia and Hezbeh could definitely school Sam and Dean Winchester on how to deal with the dark side. So please Amazon give this pilot life. I must have more!"
77358,It is kind of simplistic. The plot idea is good though. I would watch more of this if developed. Put some polish on it and it could be as good as anything on Nick.
77359,Great combination of spy thriller and domestic drama. Really clever premise and Keri Russel and Matthew Rhys really are great and believable in the lead roles.
77360,"I've watched this show from the beginning and it is always mesmerizing. Love the stories, the whole cast meshes beautifully. It is a little rough and tumble (sometimes, a lot) but that just adds to the story line and helps define the characters. While our hero, Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) is my favorite character, I have found I have come to like some of the bad guys as well. Boyd and Ava Crowder come to mind. Take a look!"
77361,"Set in dreary Indie symbolic winter, &#34;Motel Life&#34; is a story of despair and unconditional love Frank (Emile Hirsch) has for his brother Jerry Lee (Stephen Dorff). After Jerry Lee accidentally kills a kid on a bicycle, Frank abets him in disposing of the evidence and moving on. The brothers and everyone they touch have lives of despair which are brightened by Frank's story telling.When the film wasn't slow and boring, it was filled with despair. It was certainly well acted and well scripted, for what it was. However on the entertainment scale, it was one I could have missed; a good movie I didn't like.The film won the audience award at the 2012 Rome Screen Fest as well as best screenplay among 17 films.Parental Guidance: F-bomb, sex, nudity- much of it was cartoon."
77362,Good British TV but a  little gory at times.  We'll worth watching and free.
77363,The show picked up right where it left off. Their daughter may be their undoing in the end. And the interest in the Russian embassy woman who turned herself in to the KGB really continues the intrigue.
77364,"I usually don't buy many guitar straps, and when I do, I like to get a thick, leather-type one, because I've found any other strap seems to bite into my shoulder after a while, and I don't like having metal pieces on the strap that can scratch up my instruments.  I bought the black version; I think my days of jumping around and sweating while playing are over, so I probably won't worry about running colors (but I will keep an eye out for such a thing).  It's very adjustable (just not quickly adjustable), worked perfectly with my Straplocks, and keeps my 45 pound (it seems like it, anyway) Les Paul from digging into my shoulder.  The 2.5 inch width is fine for me, but if you're spending long hours strapped to a heavy monster, I'd go up to the 3 inch model, especially if you're going to be bouncing around for the greater part of 5 hours."
77365,"This is the fifth inexpensive umbrella I have purchased on Amazon since 2007 so that's about one per year.  Usually the wind takes them out though the last one was just terrible - the canopy itself was attached poorly to the frame and the cord that lifted the umbrella broke after about 30 days (that item is no longer sold on Amazon).This one out of the box and in the table is great so far but I COMMIT to coming back to add to this review in a few months to comment on the durability.  It seems like anyone can put together a seemingly decent umbrella but how they perform longer-term is what I'm interested in when I purchase one.Here the pro's and con's so far:Pro's:- Nice crank, works with a satisfying ""click"" and is easy to turn- Good canopy, blocks the light, stitching is well-sewn, only one loose thread (cosmetic)- Center pole is standard sized... my last umbrella required a larger than normal hole (2.5"")Con's:- The supports for the umbrella are aluminum.  Some higher-end umbrellas (which admittedly at this price this is not!) use PVC/plastic which gives more in the wind.  I suspect these ""arms"" will be the weak link of this umbrellaOverall this is a screaming deal at $42 even if the thing only lasts one summer.  So far, so good, highly recommended!Update 7/8:  This umbrella survived 4th of July picnics and some pretty gusty winds... operation is still excellent and it's holding up well so far!UPDATE June 2014:  This umbrella is still going strong, works and looks GREAT!  I am very pleased with this umbrella."

77368,"These glasses are comfortable and they do look like proper riding glasses. I even use them when I play golf,drive at night and shooting.  Actually these are the best shooting glasses because there is absolutely no chance of shells flying in the air and going between your eyes and glasses.  All shooters will have had some experience with this.  Since these have padding around the lens that almost seals it around your eyes.  But there are many small gaps that allow air to come in to prevent fogging.  I use these all the time and I love them."
77369,"I like the look, feel and weight of this shovel. Due to climate changes I have had very little experience using this shovel in the snow but it works good during fall leaf clean ups."
77370,"first its the superman cartoons, then batman the animated series, then spiderman in the 90's that series, then the hulk, then something new batman beyond then static shock new heroes new shows coming on tv...but then finally there was the Justice League which was pretty much the best show at that time for me when it came out and nothing after that really got my attention like that.Teen titans was cool but as I was getting older I didn't really like sidekicks too much anymore, or young heroes like that except for spider man and nightwing really.Now seeing this, Young Justice, they got Nightwing, Red-Arrow, like side-kicks but a better sidekick show then teen titans you know,  each one is like a hero and all working under or sometimes with the justice league and you always see a great variety of characters which is the best part. No idea why there isn't season 3, this was really the only show I actually watched the entire season rather then just a few episodes that looked cool."
77371,"The history of Airstream is one of legend. Long known for their iconic design and now classic Art Deco style, they have chosen to use Baker jacks on their units. I bought a previously owned 22' 2008 Safari Sport with the standard manual jack. At 4,500 Lbs, she is easy to lift with her current equipment, however, it gets fairly tiring if you are using weight distribution hitches (you should) and sway controls (you REALLY should!). Unfortunately, Amazon only stocks the VIP 3500 w/24"" Stroke with a white head unit. Many have spoken about excellent customer service from Baker -- BELIEVE IT! I called them to ask where I could locate this item with a black head unit and learned that the majority of distributers only stock the other color. HOWEVER, they said one could be made for me on the next day's production and be shipped to my home in time for a planned trip in six days from my call to Baker. IMPRESSIVE! Since I live in Michigan (they are in Battle Creek, MI), I offered to come to their location to pick it up -- a two-hour trip each way -- that's how serious I was to NOT use the manual jack anymore! I was told, essentially, to save my fuel because the shipping costs to my Airstream's location was less than $28.00. They calculated it right then, without me asking! A REAL person answered the phone and handled the transaction; I was never on hold AND I didn't have someone that was CLUELESS as to what they were selling -- OMG!! Also, I was not sure if I needed a 3000 or 3500; the woman I spoke with stated either would work, however, the 3500 would lift faster since my Safari was about 4500 Lbs. if at maximum cargo. Drum Roll.... I still payed less than $300.00 -- complete. For any of you that may need advise on towing and safety, please visit: [...] (I met Andy Thomson of CanAm RV and he is indeed a Guru on the subject!)."

77377,"My father in law collects Hummingbird feeders so I have seen my share over the years.  The amazing thing is that the birds could care less if it is cheap plastic, or an expensive glass feeder they only want the nectar.  I decided to try and entice the birds to my own backyard and the Perky Pet feeder was successful.  Its been up for a month and not a day goes by that I dont see a hummingbird taking a sip out of it.  The feeder is very solid and well put together, so far no leaks.  It is also easy to clean.  The design is subtle and not over whelming.  All in all a nice feeder."
77378,"I've been playing for about 17 years.  Most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in Columbus, Ga.  My performance guitar is a Martin HD-28 and my practice guitar is a Blueridge BR-180.I wanted a third guitar just for kicks.  I'd been looking a Taylors, but didn't want to spend that much money.Enter the Seagull S6.  A fellow picker asked if I'd ever heard of a Seagull - I hadn't - he said they were nice guitars and I ought to check them out.  So, I did a little research.  I first read all the nice reviews here for the S6 and then went on YouTube and listened to a few.  My guitar is a Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 and I really like it. I choose not to get the cedar top version because the cedar is soft, and I understand that the spruce has more volume. I got the S6 today and this evening my wife, with her Taylor GS Mini, and I, with this S6, played Smokey Mountain Memories.  Nice, real nice guitar.I found that the action on this S6 is pretty good out of the box.  I'm going to take it to my luthier tomorrow and have him install a strap pin/peg on the heel and take a look at the action at the same time, if he can make the action better, I'll let him.  I'm also going to put on some Elixir Light strings.  I don't know what kind of strings are on it out of the box.But, the bottom line is that I am very happy with the playablilty and the action of this Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 acoustic guitar right out of the box.  I'm glad I bought it."

77380,"So I got this for my Lotus.  The front starshield clear bra had pretty much worn down to the point where it was easily noticeable.I decided to use this product after removing the old film.  That was a mistake.  It took WAY too long (to remove the old film) and I don't think this paint defender system is going to last very long from the looks of it.. it peels up quite easily  after drying..Some tips. clean your paint THOROUGHLY before applying.  Remove any and all waxes and or other coatings. That will give you the best adhesion.  In retrospect, I would have been better off just spraying over the old bra.  It would have made little difference and protected just as well."
77381,"I very much enjoyed seasons 1-3, but season 4 left me on the edge of my seast episode after episode. I went through the entire season in 2 days!"
77382,"I did feel a bit cheated because it ended so abruptly.  Looking forward to a new season soon.  All characters are good, though my least favorite is the Galafinakis look alike.  Lead character's voice is slightly annoying.  These are minor criticism.  Overall, very entertaining."

77385,"I've been detailing and cleaning my vehicles for the past 15 years. So I'm rather particular about what I use and how I clean the vehicles. Which is why I used this on a friends vehicle  (with their permission) who doesn't particularly care about how it looks. :)First of all, you should NEVER use any product like this on a dirty vehicle without washing it first. Otherwise you are simply rubbing dirt directly into the paint and you will have swirl marks. Especially if you have a dark colored vehicle. The vehicle should idealy be washed with pressure washer to remove large/loose dirt (or reputable touchless wash if not available), and then with a wash mit and bucket (with grit guard) using car wash soap. If it's in the kitchen, don't use it. Car wash soap only please.Once you have a 99% clean vehicle, you may then proceed to use the Lucky Earth detailing kit. You can use this to clean up any spots you may have missed on the paint, wheels, or even glass if you feel like it. For this, the product got the job done. But then again, so does plain old H2O with a microfiber towel. Perhaps if you don't have clean water available, this would work. But then again, how did you wash the vehicle in the first place?Compared to the normal detailing products I have and currently do use such as Meguiars and Zaino... well, there is no comparison. These products do a far better job as cleaning, adding shine, protection, and even helping cover up swirls.The tire kit provides a matte finish (ie. not shiny). I'm not really sure if added any protection since it looks and feels the same as it did after it was washed with soap and water. But it did pick up more dirt. Once again, it's a tire. Water/Towel would do the same thing. We won't bother comparing this to anything else.Then you have to consider the cost. This is somewhat pricey for a detailing kit. But I suppose that's the price you pay for earth-friendly products.Pros:* Earth-friendly.* Very nice towels* Removes water spots like you've never seen before* Did I mention the soft microfiber towels?Cons:* Expensive* Potentially costly and harmful washing directions* ""Non-earth friendly"" products do much better.Overall, I like trees too. But the Lucky Earth product only cleans stuff slightly better than water. And not how they claim it should. There is no way you are ditching traditional washing methods for a spray bottle on a dirty vehicle.My suggestion: If you need a detailing kit, buy well known products such as Meguiars and use them on cars only. Not trees. They are definitely car-friendly."
77386,"This is a refillable Tomcat bait trap with eight bait refills that will kill up to 12 mice each.  It&#8217;s not a trap that mice will be trapped in, but rather one that they will go into to eat the bait and leave.  It&#8217;s rather hard to see how much they&#8217;ve eaten at this point in time, but when the block is gone, the trap can be disposed of.  The bait is enclosed in the trap, but the top is clear plastic and it will be easy to see when it needs to be discarded.  Apparently with ingestion of a very small amount the mice will die within a couple of days, but not in the trap itself.We do have pets and obviously we don&#8217;t want anything around the house that can inadvertently harm them.  These are &#8220;Kid & Dog Resistant,&#8221; but if you have your doubts, take a pass and continue using the old Victor traps if need be.  I&#8217;ve even used the electronic method with some success.  I&#8217;m not going to be using any of the Tomcat Mouse Killer traps in any accessible place in the house, but rather in my small barn.Field mice usually are more problematic in the fall when they are heading to shelter, but manage to be busy throughout the year.  I&#8217;m using the Tomcats outside.  I do like the concept and like it much better than the d-Con I&#8217;ve tried in the past.  They came in a box and just seemed to attract more mice than they eliminated.  I also was concerned about how the poison seemed to be spread all over the place.  Not enamored with that method.I&#8217;m not quite sure how the Tomcat Mouse Killer system will work in the long run, but I definitely like the system.  I will not be using it in any place where animals or children will have easy access to it at all.  My comfort level isn&#8217;t high when I take any chances, which in the case of bromethain I&#8217;m not planning on it.  Better system than the open-boxed d-Con I&#8217;ve used in the past, but how well it works in the long run remains to be seen."
77387,"So it wasn't the best acting... but I love the idea.  I was guessing what was going on right until the end.  I still don't know, but want to know more.  I think the actors have potential, maybe the director wasn't very good, maybe they didn't have enough time, I don't know how these things work, but I'd like to see them make this one work!  I was sorely disappointed that Zombiland wasn't created last year.  Don't disappoint me this year."
77388,I have three large oak trees on my property and lots of squirrels.  I hate it when the get into my garbage cans. They will even chew through plastic covers to get inside. The also jump from some of my smaller trees onto my roof.I used this around my garbage cans and small trees. It works. I still see squirrels in my yard but they are staying away from my garbage cans and the smaller trees near my house.I like the fact that this is safe for animals and humans. It seems to last despite some rain storms. It does not any noticeable odor.This keeps the squirrels away. It is not toxic and lasts despite rain storms. It is a great product.
77389,"This is an excellent value, with 2 caveats:- Actual bench is not as shiny and glossy as the Amazon photos. It has a light brown matte look to it, not the rich shiny orange look that's in the photo.- Wood slats for seating have no give, so they are quite hard on bony butts. If sitting for a prolonged period, you may wish to use a padded cushion for extra comfort.That's it for the negatives. The attractiveness and simple elegance of the design is what drew me to this bench. It looks great, even if it isn't as shiny and oiled up as the Amazon photos make it out to be. It is real, solid wood (scientific name: Dryobalanops, sold under the tradename ""Kapur""; product origin: Vietnam), not veneer, laminate or MDF, so the $[...] price tag is reasonable.Assembly is somewhat painless, once you figure out the diagrams. There are no text instructions, and some of the drawings can be a bit confusing. It can be assembled by one person, although having an extra person hold the ends makes it a lot easier. If going at it alone, you just have to assemble it with the back resting on the floor. Sturdy and solid once all the bolts are tightened, it seats 3 people with room to spare.It looks nice in my TV room and I expect this bench to last me a long time."

I still had a few of the small ones, so I used them as templates, to cut these down. I would have rated them higher, if I could have used them as is. It's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks, but found Dunlop 423R60 0.60mm (Orange) Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks, 36-Pack which are a lot cheaper."
77395,"The Heininger 6012 Advantage SportsRack 1.25"" Receiver Trailer Hitch Lock appears to be well made and heavy duty. The lock operates smoothly and the threads are deeply cut and easy to thread. The lock cap and rubber knobs appear to be made with UV stable materials and should last a long time.I highly recommend this lock for your hitch, I will leave it on mine 100% of the time.My only concerns about the design is that the key rotates around several times when you unlock/remove the pin as the key must stay in the lock during the entire process. The problem with this is that any keyring the key is attached to will be spinning around and perhaps be a hindrance to unlocking the device as it could bind up in the confined area around the hitch pin lock.The solution is to use the key without a ring, but that can make the key easy to loose.I keep mine in a key box with with the spare tire tools."
77396,"I have a RZR and had a switch plug in the dash, I tried other more expensive switches and had more problems with that.

77397,I Really Enjoy The Movie It Was Very Good Movie Like I Sayed That My Favorite Movie Zombie I Never Got Tire Too Watch The Movie.
77398,"UPDATE: Surprise, surprise! This series is getting better. It is not restricted to a single baddie and gets better with each episode. I am starting to enjoy it, so I added one star to the rating.++By that statement, I mean that every couple of minutes you will roll your eyes at how ridiculous this series is. Most of the acting is stilted, and the female lead is unbelievable. She does not speak well nor does she communicate intelligence. I find the idea of her being an FBI candidate more implausible then there actually being a headless horseman! I like the genre so I will revisit this series at some point and see if it picks up. For now, however, it is a no go."
77399,good solid movie.....typical storyline but i still enjoyed it.....nice thrill ride at the end of the movie...who will survive...who wont & what happens to the sole survivor.......good watch..............nice ending..........and it does make you wonder what can happen when u go hiking.....not that this will really happen but u never know - makes ur mind wonder....oh my :)
77400,"First, the good parts.  I like the look and feel.  ""Silver"" powder coating finish over the aluminum frame has a nice contemporary tidy look.  Ditto for the resin slats, which look quite wood-like.  I haven't time-tested this yet, but I suspect that the resin composite will outlast genuine wood.  Slats are spaced pretty close together, which eliminates uncomfortable gaps.  Comfortable slight tilt to back support.  Nice deep seating surface gives good thigh support to tall sitters.  The armrests are rather spartan, consisting of just the aluminum framing, but I suppose this is acceptable (barely) for outdoor furniture.  The assembled item seems sturdy and strong. Thanks to the use of aluminum, it's not too heavy either.Some minimal assembly is required.  It's not much, just requiring the installation of eight screws, which will attach the four sub-pieces: back, seat, and two armrest/legs. A hex wrench is included, which is the only tool needed.Fortunately, assembly steps are fairly obvious, as the product I received did not include any paperwork at all (such as assembly instructions, warranty paperwork, factory contact info, etc).  The provided screws come in three lengths, so some instructions would have been nice.  Also a caution about using the provided washers on all screws. Do it, otherwise the cosmetic plastic screw caps (not shown on the Amazon Product Listing photos example) will not snap onto the screw heads.Second complaint -- the first screw I tightened securing the seat to the front leg stripped out.  Then so did its counterpart on the opposite end of the bench.  I was not using excessive force.  Fortunately, there are two screws used at this location, so I carefully installed #2 (a shorter screw), and was able to tighten it with good results.  The stripped screws remain snugly in place and should still function ok to provide load bearing and alignment tasks satisfactorily.Again, nice design, and these minor frustration items I can easily put behind me, but this is not a ""cheap"" bench so these quality control problems shouldn't have occurred.This item was manufactured in China."
77401,"USB Condenser mics and more specifically this one are great for doing Podcasts and for portability. The reason being is that they are condensers for one, and the other is that this mic has a built in interface. An interface is a glorified sound card with both a microphone preamp and (Analogue to digital, and digital to analogue) AD/DA converters. Of course most any standalone interface is going to give you way more desirable results than just plugging a microphone into the mic jack on your computer; way, way better. So this MXL Studio 24 USB even with the built in interface is going to give you quality far exceeding your computers potential. So instead of having to carry a separate interface around with you having this all in one MXL Studio 24 USB all you need is a laptop with a USB input and you.There are limitations though with a USB mic with the main one being that you can only record the microphone without being able to plug in any instruments. (Although you could record instruments using this microphone and that way be able to layer more tracks in your DAW.) Recording multiple tracks at the same time is not possible with this mic unless you are recording the same thing in multiple tracks.The really good thing about this mic is that you are getting some pretty decent quality for the money. So for anything that you need to do using a microphone as your one and only sound device it is ideal, quick, easy, and affordable.One of the problems with using it in Pro Tools, or any DAW is that you can only use one interface at a time. Since the mic has a built in interface you can't use any other. Even in Garage Band for MAC, although they have the ability to use more than one interface because you can toggle between the two but not be able to use two simultaneously. So in plain words if you are planning studio capabilities a USB mic is not what you need. I have a couple of MXL condenser mics that I bought for my studio. I have the MXL V57M which was their early offering but is no longer made and I have found the MXL V250 to be comparable to that one. Some other MXL's like the 990 are muddy in the bottom end. When bottom fishing for a good/decent condenser mic some of the CAD offerings are also top sellers.When using the MXL 24 USB in Win 7 no driver download is necessary. If your mic comes without the included CD you can download the free MXL Studio Control app which includes input controls for microphone gain and an adjustable high pass filter. It also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold. There are also output adjustments as well.One other thing that is unique about USB mics working with your PC is that they are dependent of course on your PC. So I had the hardest time trying to figure out what was wrong when I couldn't get the output from my PC or into the free Reaper DAW recording software (free 60 day trial) also downloadable from MXL. So I finally gave up after trying various input options etc and discovered through the troubleshooter in Windows 7 accessible via Control panel, and then ""Sound"" and then type ""Troubleshooter"" into the search box in the upper right corner. The answer was that my mic input volume inside of Windows was down to zero. I moved the slider up and bang it worked.So for sound quality you are getting decent quality for the price and it has a built in interface and even an output jack you can plug your headphones into; it's a mini jack like you have on your computer. So with just your laptop and this mic you are set for pod-casting, or any other function that requires only one microphone and no other channels. This mic comes with a desktop stand which is an indication of its intended purpose as opposed to a studio vocal or instrument mic."
77402,"Single-Handed offers the complexity of what some people would consider the simple life of a small community in Ireland.  Jack tries very hard to earn the trust of the locals, but sometimes he lets them down.  I like the &#34;human&#34; quality that the writers emphasize in his character.  Just because you wear a uniform doesn't instantly dismiss the conflicts of character.  I admire the persistence of Jack's character, however, to follow good.  I always look forward to the next episode, knowing that the same problems are encountered in the everyday lives of people no matter where they live."
77403,"Interesting storyline.  And Timothy Olyphant is perfect for the roll he plays as a US Marshall with a less than perfect past, not to mention that Timothy is NOT hard on the eyes...

77404,"The gloves themselves are very good at resisting heat. The are made of strong material that reflects heat, however, they are one size fits all and for me, they were huge which made them rather clumsy. My husband was able to pull the gloves more taut and were easier for him to use. Although large in size, they do keep you protected from  the heat of the grill and make it easier to handle the grilling process and transportation of the food to the table. They are also better than pot holders for baking.  I can imagine they would be fantastic to use for outdoor campfire grilling. I received the gloves free and would definitely recommend them. I would suggest the company make a smaller size."
77405,"The wiper is easy to install on my 2000 Honda Odyssey and I don't have to use any of the included adapter...just remove the old wiper and slid in the new one.The wiper is different from others as it does not have metal frame. It's very flexable and fits to the windshield pretty well.Like other wipes that I used before, they all worked well in the fist couple of months. However, the wiping quality degrades after the wiper rubber is harden by exposing to sunligh for couple of months.Like other reviewers, I will update the my review in a few months."
77406,"This is a feeder intended for wild orioles. It consists of a lavender tinged plastic bottle that, turned upside down, screws into a circular orange base plate. The base plate includes a small plunger that can be turned from the bottom to release more food from the jar into the base plate. Assembled, the feeder stands approximately 8&#8221; high and is 8.5&#8221; in diameter. The plastic bottle has a capacity of approximately 20 fluid ounces. Empty, the feeder weighs under 2 ounces. The base plate includes a outer edge that birds can use for toe holds, and 3 holes on the outer edge that could accommodate a hanging chain or twine (shown in the product photo, but NOT included). The feeder is designed so that the plastic bottle can be replaced with a jelly jar (2.25&#8221; diameter, slightly smaller than standard home canning jelly jars).I was thoroughly unimpressed with the quality of this feeder, starting with the fact that no chain or other hanging implement was included in the package. It is up to you to find a way to hang the feeder, either that, or you will need to set the feeder on a ledge or table. In general, orioles do like fruit, especially oranges, so this feeder might be attractive if you've got orioles in your neighborhood. However, given that all you get in this package is a plastic bottle and a simple plastic base plate, the list price seems exorbitantly high."
77407,"I've just got the Shure SM58 microphone.As expected, this is a real workhorse of microphones; the sound is clear, crispy, robust, high quality product.Also, I've bought it at Amazon and they sold through J&R; Music and Computer World which is an excellent supplier. They shipped in less time than expected.I'm a really happy customer now."
77408,"The film starts out as a family moves once again. Single alcoholic mom (Mira Sorvino) has three children and can't hold a job. Sisters Sandra (Abigail Breslin) and Beth (Georgie Henley) dream of the idea life, one where mom bakes strawberry cupcakes. Mom turns their dreams into nightmares with a train of abusive boyfriends, the latest of which has designs for Beth. The girls conspire along with two friends to make their lives better by eliminating the problem.Georgie Henley gave us a decent goth Fairuza Balk while Abigail Breslin was our slutty Barbie Doll. The film developed at the right pace and was fairly decent for the first hour, until the deed was done. At that point it moves rapidly and falls apart.The film is made for Lifetime fans of true stories. This one should do as a Redbox rental with low expectations.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity."

77412,"Heaven is for Real joins several other Christian-themed films that have already made their debuts in 2014, including Son of God, Noah, and God&#8217;s Not Dead.  Son of God was nothing more than a safe depiction of Jesus Christ&#8217;s life (and is more suitable as a Bible study tool than a feature film), while Noah was an admirable endeavor, yet overshadowed mightily by the blatant CGI abuse.  And, God&#8217;s Not Dead was so horrible that it might very well be the worst movie of 2014 (and even thinking about what a colossal waste of time the movie was has continued to incenses me).  Regardless and on a much happier note, Heaven is for Real is the least polarizing movie in this group &#8211; making for a pleasant viewing experience.Based on a true story (and the best selling book), Randall Wallace (We Were Soldiers, Secretariat) directs Heaven is for Real, starring Greg Kinnear as Todd Burpo.  The Burpo family has fallen on hard financial times and Todd has spread himself thin working several different jobs, the most notable of which is a small town minister.  Still, Todd stays positive for his wife, Sonja (Kelly Reilly), and their two children, Colton (Connor Corum) and Cassie (Lane Styles), even despite the sudden outbreak of unfortunate occurrences.In need of a short vacation, the family takes a trip &#8211; but both Cassie and Colton wind up sick upon their return.  Several days pass and Colton&#8217;s health fails to improve, prompting a trip to the hospital where he quickly winds up in surgery.  While on the operating table, Colton has a near death experience in which he claims to have entered Heaven and briefly met Jesus.  He recovers without incident, but is able to recount seemingly unexplainable moments and details of the afterlife that startle the small Nebraska community.  However, after his recovery, it&#8217;s not Colton that&#8217;s shaken, but rather Todd &#8211; who has difficulty coping with the emotional backlash.Naturally and not uncommon these days, the movie trailer gives away quite a bit of the film&#8217;s story before you even sit down to view the film.  Initially, you&#8217;re led to believe this is a story about a boy who likely had a heart-stopping brush with death.  Although Colton doesn&#8217;t die (not even for a moment), his rapid recovery is attributed as a miracle &#8211; an emotional response that&#8217;s not really pounded home or fully magnified over the course of the film.  Instead, his ailment appears to be rather ordinary &#8211; discouragingly causing his traumatic event to feel almost like a standard procedure.  What&#8217;s not ordinary or disingenuous, though, is the &#8220;out of body&#8221; experience that he has and the amount of detail he&#8217;s able to recount from the spiritual journey.In reality, this film presents a story that is less about a boy and more about a father, which is portrayed wonderfully though Greg Kinnear&#8217;s exquisite performance as Todd Burpo.  For roughly half of the film, Todd is forced to endure several physically adverse challenges, starting with the fact that he has to work several jobs just to pay the bills (and even that isn&#8217;t enough).  On top of that, he innocently breaks his leg during a softball game, and shortly after is bombarded by one of the male species&#8217; greatest fears: kidney stones.  Finally, his son&#8217;s health takes a turn for the worst, and that&#8217;s where the mental anguish comes into play, and unsurprisingly, it&#8217;s enough to waver anyone&#8217;s convictions.Unlike the unbearable God&#8217;s Not Dead, this particular story doesn&#8217;t become about believers versus non-believers (though there was definitely room for it).  Thankfully, that&#8217;s an argument that has no business in this depiction &#8211; yet at the same time, Kinnear&#8217;s character does take the time to visit the possibility that the experience his son had wasn&#8217;t necessarily Heaven at all.  It could have easily been explained by doctors as nothing more than the boy&#8217;s mind playing tricks on him, or even a complete and utter hallucination.  Still, that wouldn&#8217;t explain how he knows exactly what he knows (which is eerie at times).  Never the less, this forces the film to tangle with the central idea that if you are indeed a believer in God, it takes an act of faith in order to believe anything at all.Overall, Heaven is for Real will likely attract Christian moviegoers more than any other group.  Members of that particular group will likely find this film to be mostly uplifting and thought provoking &#8211; without any major complaint.  Casual attendees or non-believers will be quick to judge it (assuming they even see it) as another piece of writer&#8217;s fiction.  Regardless of where you fall, the thematic elements about the importance of family, devotion, and uncertainty, can&#8217;t be denied here.  The cast is adorably charming, and Connor Corum does a commendable job, along with Greg Kinnear.  Personally, I have no problem saying that I found Heaven is for Real to be not only entertaining, but also the most satisfactory Christian film thus far in 2014.  Is this film for everyone?  No, but find me a movie this is and I&#8217;ll shake your hand.  Sure, this film can be overzealous at times &#8211; with a few exaggerations and the occasional silliness, but in the end, it makes a wholesome, honest movie.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com"
77413,"This is a good strong net. It's bigger than i expected, but the clips can easily move around the net, so you can essentially make it smaller for whatever you are trying to carry. I use it to keep a backpack or other bags on my bike when needed. Could fit a helmet under it if needed. I recommend."
77414,"To me, this series can be pretty darn good...I hope they keep it running and not saddle it with idiots and break it as they have done with so many decent tv series that get chopped and cut by studios and then rehashed into dung heap reruns...this series is a pretty good one which I can personally relate to as a medical professional.  Enjoy the show, it is pretty decent...This season was a bit weird not having the old staffers with House but they did some rather odd things and came out ok.  Some of the plot ideas I think could have used some rethinking but they did the student stuff ok overall.  I will be interested to see what happens with the old staffers in the next season."
77415,It keeps the dust and smoke out for $15. It replaced my OEM filter that had a nice carpet of dust on it from the previous owner.
77416,"This is by far the best wheel cleaner I've ever used. I've used both Meguiar's, Mother's and Chemical Guys. They all worked decently, I tend to prefer the Meguiar's Hot Rims over the rest; however it doesn't come close to how well this works. With 4 piston brembo calipers and hawk hps pads, my Evo's brakes spew out a TON of dust onto my wheels. It's a constant battle to keep them somewhat clean. If I let it sit on there too long and gather more road gunk, it was impossible to get off with Meguiar's (or anything else) alone, and would require scrubbing (sometimes with a harsh/dangerously hard bristled) brush. Not anymore! This cuts through caked on rims even after a couple months of horrible neglect.You might need to use two passes with it, depending how hard caked the gunk is. My advise is:-First spray the wheels with my meguiars soap and pressure wash them to get off as much as possible before applying this.-If you have a light cleaning (usually less then a couple weeks for my car), then you can get by with spraying two rims at a time. If you're going to have to scrub some of the gunked on mess it's probably best to do one rim at a time. Spray your rim(s) generously getting in your inner rim if possible, your lug nuts, etc.-The liquid will come out kind of greenish and then turn an orangish/redish as it breaks down brake dust. It has a very strong (like cat urine) odor that you just have to get used to.-Let it sit on there for a couple of minutes (usually don't want more then 5). You don't want it to dry on the rim, although having accidentally done this - it washed off no problem.-If it's a light cleaning you can probably get by with just pressure washing it clean at this point, although to make sure you get all parts of the rims I usually go over it withGriot's Garage 15704 Micro Fiber Wheel Wand, (Pack of 2). If the caked on mess requires harder scrubbing I'd recommend something like autogeek's ""speed master wheel brush"".This bottle usually last about 16 individual wheel cleanings. It makes it the most expensive option out there, but by far the best and safest! It is acid free and ph balanced, and is specifically designed to be safe on all rims. I use this on BBS, Enkei, and WedsSports rims that cost over 1000-1500/per, all the time. I have no worry that this can in any way danger them. A lot of other products out there can be a hit or miss, and especially if you have refinished rims it can be very risky. My BBS are refinished and so far this has not worn it off or damaged them whatsoever. If you're looking for a bit cheaper solution, there'sSonax 230500 Yellow Wheel Cleanerto use as a refill. You can also checkout autogeek, depending on their sales, coupon codes, and shipping situation - you can usually find a better deal there."
77417,"Got these to swap my indicator lights on the motorcycle. It was hard to see the stock 1.7W bulbs during the day (even the 3.4W on high beam indicator). These are way brighter and I can see all the indicators clearly during the day and they are NOT blinding me at night.A few extras for people who are interested:The bulb is a single lens SMD5050 that operates at ~3V and draws ~30mA. In order to allow it to work with 12-14V car installations, there are two resistors in the bulb housing, 180 Ohm each. So the total power draw is 420mW at 14V, out of which 90mW ends up in the LED to give you the light.So far I have not noticed them turning blue over time or anything like that. Nice, bright white, probably around 5000K.One bulb came in slightly damaged (wires were embedded in the plastic housing), but I was able to fix it with a pocket knife.I'm very satisfied with these."

77420,This is not a true 75 foot garden hose. It only expands to 75 feet when it is filled with water and under pressure. So if you have it attached to a sprinkler or something else it may have the inclination to retract it self.It also isn't good for things such as draining tanks because it relies on a fairly heavy water pressure to operate. I tried to use it to drain the expansion tank on my coal boiler and it would not work because the water pressure was not nigh enough.Pros: it is light. It also does not take up a lot of space. Very good for people who have limited room to store a hose. Would be good on a boat or camper.
77421,"My landlord's house is between two rental houses, one of which we are in. The land is beautiful sweeping mountain land they have planted with apple trees, grapes, and a variety of flowers and bushes. We have a communal garden plot as well as a communal chicken coop. My landlord loves the deer that come and has planted an area just for them to browse. But their well-worn path into the area goes right through the apple trees and too close to the tempting garden plot.We are under no illusions that the deer will go away, nor would we really want them to. We enjoy sharing the land with all the critters that come here and, rather than trying to eliminate nuisances, we prefer to seek balance in the ecosystem using permaculture principles and simple deterrents that help the critters make choices that just happen to work out better for us as well.What we are experimenting with now with these deer-repellent stakes is diverting the path of the deer so they skirt the apple trees and garden and head, instead, for the browsing area that ought to give them plenty to eat. I have yet to catch the deer in their act so I can't report yet on how effectively the stakes work for our purposes, but the fact that I haven't seen them at all is saying something. When the apple trees start to flower, that's when we'll have a better sense of how well the stakes are working at refocusing the deer. When I have something more to report, I will update this review."
77422,"Filled with water, it keeps ants from getting to my humming bird feeder. I bought it for one of my feeders that does not have a water well. My Hummzinger feeders have  built in water wells so I didnt need any for those feeders. My feeders are on shepard's hooks and I also put vaselene on the pole just above the grass line. Made a little cone to keep the rain off of the vaselene. Ants hate vaselene and in hot weather the water wells dry up fast."
77423,"Continuum is a well written show with enough suspense to keep you interested, enough plot twists to keep you guessing, and enough political relevance to keep you questioning and thinking. The premise is very interesting. A group of terrorists travel back in time to try to win the future, but they are followed by a cop from the future as well who is hell bent on stopping them. Here's the catch though, the terrorists aren't fighting a holy war. They are fighting for freedom. As part of the group Liberate, they fight against the corporate take over of America, a theme very relevant today. The real problem with them is their methods. They are incredibly violent and kill people to seek their ends. This is where Kiera Cameron, the cop from the future comes in. She has really cool tech from the future that helps her stop the bad guys, but in the future it really helps her fellow cops oppress the people to serve the corporate government. Kiera, however, became a cop, or Protector as they are called in the show, to actually protect people, and it is for this reason that she is hell bent on stopping Liberate. As the show progresses, she realizes she shares some of the ideals that Liberate shares, even if Liberate's actions are detestable. There is also the element of time travel that plays into the show's intrigue. Did they all travel back in time and change the time line, or has everything they are about to do already been done? The show keeps you on your toes, and it keeps you wanting more. I definitely recommend watching it, and I cannot wait for the second season!"

77427,"This device could easily pay for itself after a few uses.  Apparently, cars can have error codes that don't rise to the degree of lighting up the check engine light.  That was the case when I hooked up this to my vehicle.  It showed a transmission problem code, but no dash light lit up.  I took it to a local shop and was able to get a sensor replaced before additional damage was done.This device can be for the novice or the pro by showing you the codes, offering fixes via the Fix Assist, as well as doing live snapshots of data which are helpful to the pros.  It will also remember your vehicles so you don't have to enter it each time.  I guess it needs your vehicle type to determine what fixes you'll need.It comes with a nice, durable case and it appears well built.  It should last a long, long time.I wish I had gotten this a long time ago.  Who knows how much it would have saved me."

77430,"ANGELS CREST is not a perfect movie: there are so many undeveloped sidebars that keeping everyone in a place where they seem to fit into the tale is difficult.  But there are some powerful performances here and some cause for reflection that makes the movie very worthwhile watching. Based on the novel by the same name written by Leslie Schwartz, adapted for the screen by Catherine Trieschmann, and directed by Gaby Dellal, the story deals with numerous interactions of a small town populated with alcoholics, drug abusers, adulterers, and other strange types and how they deal with a tragedy that makes no sense.Nate Denton (Ameko Eks Mass Carroll) is a 3 year old son of Ethan Denton (Thomas Dekkar in a breakout performance that deserves attention) who awakens one morning in his pathetic home to tell his beloved single dad that it is snowing.  The father/son bond is strong and Ethan dresses them both to go out to view the beauty of the snowy countryside in their old truck.  When they arrive at a perfect spot, Ethan turns to the backseat to take Nate out to make snowmen, but Nate has fallen asleep in this safety car seat.  Ethan makes the truck warm, locks the truck and walks out to view the spectacle of winter, the deer, and the eloquent mountains.  In a few minutes he returns - and Nate is gone!  Ethan is terrified, begins shouting his son's name as he searches for him.  The town is alerted and a search party begins.  Nate's mother alcoholic mother Cindy (Lynn Collins) is notified of Nate's missing and begins her tirade on every person she meets.  After an overnight search for Nate, Ethan discovers Nate's frozen body and is devastated. Ethan is taken into custody for a death stemming from negligence and the townspeople form sides as to Ethan's guilt.  Among them is a waitress Angie (Mira Sorvino) and her small daughter Rosie (Emma Macgillivray), Ethan's friend Rusty (Joseph Morgan), a lesbian couple (Elizabeth McGovern and Kate Walsh), Cindy's preachy  mother (Barbara Williams). and the local police.  The town brings in the District Attorney (Jeremy Piven) who obviously has secrets of his won that mirror Ethan's crisis.  The story is resolved in a strange and tragic manner, leaving many crises unsolved.Thomas Dekkar gives such a fine performance that we are able to see inside his heart and head and soul.  The supporting cast conveys the small town response to a tragedy among their own - who is guilty of what and how could the incident have ever occurred.  There are many ideas created by the writers and the characters that are never realized fully, but the sense of human response to an accident is staggeringly real.  There is much more to this film in retrospect, after watching it, that haunts the viewer.  Grady Harp, December 11"

77433,"i'll preface my lukewarm review by saying a man is not a movie, and it is necessary to set aside the man in order to review the movie. one can ask: what would ebert himself have said about this film?this story falls into two distinct parts. the documentary part concerns the life and times of roger ebert, boy journalist, adult editor and larger than life, groundbreaking movie critic and television personality. this is interesting as biography and as a historical look at journalism in the days before media empires made newspapers obsolete and cable channels made broadcast television irrelevant. compiled from archive materials and latter day interviews, all this material is fascinating and enlightening.the travails part of the film is entirely focused on ebert's disfiguring, debilitating and agonizing medical troubles, including close ups of painful medical procedures and the terrible deformities that had to be accepted as the price of ""affirming life"". this is absolutely a necessary part of the ebert story and ebert was courageous to permit the extensive filming.it's unfortunate that these two parts don't work together. part of the problem is incredibly indulgent editing (i could predict during the movie that director james was also an editor) that makes this film about 30 minutes too long and makes the life appear almost secondary to its end. but part of the problem is omission: ebert is healthy, then he is sick; he's a TV personality, then he's a blogger. by jumping back and forth between present and past, and focusing far too much on the gruesome present, we jump over the crucial transition. the two years between ebert's cancer diagnosis and his public announcement that he was ""a sick man"" is a blank; ""ebert and roeper"" is ignored. the progress of his disease is merely common: it's the response of the man to the disease that is significant. it's not a transition that can be tracked in ebert's own voiceover, reading passages from ""life itself"", because surgery took away his voice.ebert was a populist, but he was no sentimentalist. he could approve a benji movie because it was appropriate for its audience of children. what is the audience for this film? if it's the sentimental ebert fans who adore his reviews and worship his memory, then it's probably an admirable work. despite its candor about ebert's bullying, egotistical temperament, this is really a tribute film, a two hour eulogy: it was directed and produced by filmmakers whom ebert helped in their careers.as someone who admires ebert but hardly to excess, and doesn't really care about his interest in used bookstores, his father or his walks in the park, i found this film lost its way in its desire to cram in every biographic detail and share his final months at every step, yet omit the process by which ebert reinvented his career and faced his end without losing his journalistic integrity."

77435,"Behind all the refined and proper outward presentation of a symphony orchestra is a reality. Musicians are like the rest of us. Sometimes virtuous, sometimes sinful. Sometimes some drink too much, smoke weed, engage in illicit sexual adventures, demonstrate greed and selfishness, and rise to levels of pure goodness worthy of the most admirable among us. Thus we have Mozart in the Jungle. The pilot episode does not have me hooked to be a committed and faithful viewer, but it intrigues me to check out some more episodes, should they be forthcoming. And I hope they will."
77436,"This is not a bad product, just not great.  As soon as I received it, I installed it on my custom made Grit Laskin Guitar, and played with it for over two hours.  Installation was fast, and only took a couple of minutes.  My problems with it are 3 fold:  #1.  Sounds just a bit ""tinny"" = too much on the high end, and not an equal amount of bass.  #2.  A small complaint is that you have to dismantle the entire installation just to change the batteries, and I couldn't get mine to work in ""passive"" mode.  #3.  And the biggest complaint, is that the volume control is difficult to get to when you're performing on stage.  You have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft.  Like I said, it is not a bad product, just not top notch, and definitely not for professionals.  If you're just fooling around at home, or recording at home, it is fine, and will do the job for you.  BUT!!!  If you're a pro, you'll want to spend double the money and get an L. R. Baggs M-80.  The M-80 gives you the truest sound (unbelievable), works in passive mode, and is very easy to change the volume control.  Sincerely, Doc"

Each side has a pair of 4"" x 4"" boxes, to give you 4 total, and the top is 4"" by 9.25"" long.  All of the boxes are 2 inches deep.  These are not for large plants, but can be used to grow herbs, microgreens, or flowers.  The boxes and the sliding connectors are made of wood, and each compartment is lined with a plastic box.This sturdy planter will brighten up your window sill with 3 levels of houseplants."
77441,I love the look of this hanging outside half-nestled and hidden among the red pansies and fuchsia with gladiolus and hibiscus a little bit off to the side. The glass itself is long and flask-like and held more sugar-water than I thought it would. There are four actual little feed-spots which are rather small compared to the red of the glass. The metal of the dish is thin and has a sort of hammered feel to it. The same metal but thick and sturdy is wrapped around the top of the red glass to hold the feeder aloft with a handle. The glass and metal cause it to be heavier than other hummingbird feeders I have had but I like that since it hangs better and doesn't blow in the breeze and spill out the sugar-water.  I have seen a few visitors (I'm not sure if it is just the same visitor or if he has started bringing in his friends yet...) at the feeder but it is still early in the season.
77442,"Great TV show. Good acting, good plots, CGI, everything. Hope this show lasts a long time. Really fund to watch."
77443,"Deer Off makes a great product.  While using Deer Off, my garden has not been terrorized by rabbits.  This is an economical solution and all it requires is a spray pump and some water. A 32 oz bottle will yield you 2 gallons and enough to treat 4000 sq feet according to the manufacture.It dries odorless and is safe to use around pets and children.  My dog is never bothered by it, and still pees on the bushes.  But at least the flowers haven't been eaten by rabbits.It's a great product, I recommend it."
77444,"A modern day babbelon five without the space ship.  This show has great actors, an excellent plot line, great special effects, and is without a shadow of a doubt.  One of the best shows on TV."
77445,"The idea behind this product is nice: a wet-dry vac and pressure washer in one. The implementation, however, is horrible. Cords are everywhere and poorly controlled. I would greatly prefer to have these as two separate and independent products.This is my first/only pressure washer. Hadn't used one before. It works fine, and I'm somewhat impressed with the device. The added pressure certainly helps clean things, though I'm not sure it's that much more useful than just a hose with a nozzle in some situations. With the pressure on and a straight beam of water, I can carve my initials into the concrete in my driveway (don't ask how I learned that).It wasn't hard to put together, though the instruction book isn't nearly as straightforward as it could be. Basically, install about a dozen screws to get everything together (the handle, mostly).What was incredible frustrating was trying to wind the cords up and get them in place, especially after use. Rather than have a top and bottom anchor for you to wrap the cords around, there's only one on top, leaving the cords to flop around wherever they want to. Which, if not coiled absolutely perfectly, is everywhere. On both sides. One side is the high-pressure water hose (stiff and rigid, this is the cord that goes everywhere), the other side has the power cord. Both could have used a lower support. Incredibly stupid not to include one.Then there's the small wet/dry vac that sits on top of the whole contraption. I didn't have one, so thought I'd be killing two birds with one stone by getting this product. Anyway, there's no place for its cord to go either, so you just coil it up and hope it stays in place. I do like the vac though, it's a nice small size, with plenty of suction. Handy. I'll probably use that more than the pressure washer. So they'll end up living in separate places anyway, and don't need to be nested like they are.Anyway... to sum up: each device works fine. Cord management is the worst I've ever seen for a product. Having the vac and washer as two separate items would be more logical."
77446,Bought this with Rancho bracket kitRancho RS5567 Steering Stabilizer Bracket Kitfor my 2002 f150 7700 on 35s. steering is much smoother and the steering wheel doesnt move when hitting bumps. i love it!
77447,"I love this show.  It is very heartwarming to see a family series like this one.  It is witty, intelligent, heartwarming, and humorous all at once.  I so enjoy the costumes and the hairstyles.  I recommend this to anyone who loves history as much as I do."
77448,"the right mix of drama, violence, and T/A.  I can't believe I waited this long to watch it.  There's only two seasons so try not to binge watch it..."
77449,"The horns were easy to install. They draw about the same amount of current as my stock horns (in the 2.5A to 3A range for each PIAA horn), so I was able to use the stock wiring, relay, and fuse instead of having to wire a separate connection to the battery positive. I used Installation Type B (two horns, each with a single wire). The stock horn positive connections plugged directly into the positive quick connect of the PIAA horns. I didn't have to cut off the stock connectors and crimp on new connectors. The stock horns use a single connection, so I ran a separate ground wire from each PIAA horn to a ground point near the hood latch.I made an inverted T bracket to hang the two horns off of the location for one of the stock horns. The PIAA horns are a bit larger than a typical stock ""beep-beep"" style Japanese horn, so you do have to plan ahead to make sure that you have enough room for the horns and whatever mounting bracket you may use. I angled my PIAA horns slightly outward (instead of hanging straight down) to clear an engine brace below the horns.The horns have a nice Euro sound and are suitably loud."
77450,This look great and worked very well. only had the chance to use one time. end of the camping season for winter is now upon use.. I don't know why this product isn't already on all campers when you buy them. would and will tell my friends about this product.greatly meets my expectation.
77451,Wow! I'm not one to watch war movies at all. It was the interest in Chinese history that made me watch. An epic!
77452,"I would be very shocked if it lasts the whole season. The head bent the first time I used it, straightened out easily but after a few time I can see it breaking."
77453,I can not say enough about this stuff. it is the very best cleaner I have ever used it just knocked my socks off.
77454,you pay for the name. I had to buy it because I don't find any other brand. The screw on top mo use what so ever. It got destroyed at first try.
77455,It's good but water pressure just okay... Probably due to the thinness of the hose. But it keeps the hose neat and tidy without much work.
77456,"I love this show it's so great the story always has you on your toes, and twits and turns when you least expect it. I think season 4 is almost as good as season 2!"
77457,makes good smoke taste
77458,"I got an episode in February, but then no more. are there any more episodes going to start soon? Really enjoy this show"
77459,"As I mentioned in the title, this simply snaps to the stand and holds picks. Enough said. It does its job and does it ok for my taste."
77460,"This tow ball is a great step up from the stock u-haul one i had. This adds +1500lb towing capacity and is a lot sturdier. Rock solid and nothing can get through this. Surprised at the price, should be more for how much of a tank it is. Great buy!"
77461,"All I can say is that this show was extremely boring. It was too much like Dark Angel. When you think of Beauty and the Beast, you think of a beast, not some governmental experiment gone wrong."
77462,Each season gets better and better; the special effects are great!  Great show; like the actors and how the show keeps fresh!
77463,"This show started out wonderful!  Cleaning up messes in DC, wow very nice!  Loved it!  Then last season wow Hucks character just when nuts!  This got a little brutal, torturing a team mate on the show, pulling teeth, a little to graphic!  We will see how they do next time around!  The show brings new surprises in each episode!  Hold onto your knickers, the sky is the limit!"
77464,"With Peter Paige as one of the creators of this show, nothing but EXCELLENCE could have followed. One of the main reasons I started watching this show (not the only) has to do with my admiration for Peter. I have listened to a few of his interviews and became a real fan. I know the first show I ever saw him in was very, very special. And probably changed the world just a little bit for the better. Can you be proud of someone you don't know, if so I am. Congratulations...!!!  PETER PAIGE...!!!  Thank You, Sincerely, an original fan of Q.A.F."
77465,"The mystery of it all is keeping my interest, but I do not care for the fact that every single one of the high school main characters has had an intimate scene, if not several.  Couldn't they give at least one of the girls some morals?"
77466,"As you probably know, these are charcoal briquettes made from coconut husks which, from my view as an environmentalist, is a perfectly terrific idea. After all, what else could you do with a discarded coconut husk? And most folks are unaware that nearly every other charcoal brand uses mutiple wood species in their mix so flavor consistency can become an issue at times... but not with these coconut husk briquettes.In any case, I actually like these briquettes far better than Kingsford brand (and many other less-well-known varieties) because it gives me more latitude in terms of flavoring foods on my charcoal grill. Most charcoal brands impart a particular flavor (such as hickory or mesquite) but this one just leaves you with a nice even *smokey* flavor [being fairly undefinable beyond that vague description]. This means that if I actually desire a hickory flavor, I can toss in a small piece of water-soaked hickory wood with it -- the same goes with apple wood, yellow poplar (which is superb for chicken), and so on.I cook from scratch, grilling quite often, and I have numerous barbeque/grilling recipes posted [free to print them] on Food.com [formerly Recipezaar] under my screen name there of Bone Man. I would highly recommend this charcoal for any of those recipes. I also employ my Chinese wok directly on this charcoal having discovered that these briquettes function really exceptionally in that mode, due largely to their notably high heat capacity. (Of course you can also limit this heat through the venting of your grill if you wish.)This charcoal is *very* easy to light (it does require charcoal lighter which is a superior method to using the [pre-soaked] *matchlight* briquettes, offered by Kingsford and others), and the coals burn very hot and evenly. You won't see tons of smoke but the smokey flavor gets imparted nonetheless, especially when the lid is closed on the grill. I'm pretty excited about this new product which presents me with many more options while using my charcoal grill.Highly recommended."
77467,Well worth the price! I use these on every car I do and the are the best priced wheel brushes you can find.
77468,"This bait applicator is a quality item which will last for years. It is easy to operate, and the bait is easy to apply. I like that is it made of a coated metal, and that the handles have foam. We are using this for our growing vole problem, and I prefer to apply bait in a direct manner rather than  broadcast bait where non-targeted species might get at it.Recommended."
77469,Meguiar's makes great products and this is no different. Easy to change the pad and the pad stays in place one it is set. This pad also does not absorb all the wax either. This is a good thing.
77470,"The trials and tribulations of neophyte vegans.  Interesting but not inspiring, at least not to me.  It may be noble to be vegan but the film lacked energy."
77471,I use these with my chimney starter to light my charcoal and there is nothing better. Leaves no smell on the charcoal like lighter fluid and is safer. I use one cube under my chimney starter and 20 or so minutes later I spread my charcoal and start cooking. Great product and cheap.
77472,"Lets be clear.  This cover fits perfectly, even has a bump built in to cover the handle.  The cover is a thin material, however it is a very durable, heavy duty material.  The seams are well made.  While I have only had this cover for a few weeks, I fully expect to last many years."
77473,"This flower box is very pretty and I really liked the option of the adjustable fitting to the deck rails and the expandable option in case I wanted a longer box.  However there seems to be a major design flaw.I got the flower box out of the packaging and put it together (screwed the plastic screwcaps to the brackets to size)  My deck railing is wide, 6 "" , and while it was wide enough to go over the rail it was evident that it wasn't going to stay on the rail.  I was able to just screw into the the decking through the back brackets to hold it tight.  I felt that if there was a return of some sort on the back of the bracket to grasp the railing that might hold it in place better (that is what my other flower box holder has and it stays up fine)If you don't mind screwing into your decking then this would work fine for you.I can not vouch for smaller railings, but this is what might be necessary for the wider ones."
77474,If you ignore the animation this is actually pretty entertaining. My 5 yr old likes the music and the art creation aspect of the show.
77475,"How well this device holds up depends on what kind of surface it is attached to.  It can be drilled into adobe or other wall surfacing like wood.  It should hold a 50' hose with no problem, or a longer electrical cord.  It's quite simple and made to keep a garden hose or cord from laying on the ground and being an obstacle.  How effective it is depends on how high off the ground it is and how secure it is mounted.  It does not come with any screws."
77476,Got tired of using a ruler or a penny to check tires.  This is very accurate and repeatable and allows me to monitor tire wear.  so simple and so easy and reasonably priced to me.  Nice if you are buying a used car to check the tire wear for remaining life as well as uneven wear across tire or side to side which can help id other problems.
77477,"Don't believe the ad statement 'heavy duty cord' translates into 'heavy duty' anything, other than maybe rubber insulation. THIS IS FOR LOW-POWER ITEMS ONLY!!! It is 20-AWG wire inside, barely enough wire diameter to run a 5-watt speaker. If you think you are going to plug in a tire inflator, a 1,000,000 candle spotlight, etc., you are SADLY MISTAKEN. This is NOT, repeat NOT heavy duty. It is a crime that the wire AWG (American Wire Gauge) is not listed in the specs. Otherwise, you would know that plugging in a heavy amperage load is either going to burn this up in a split second, or turn it into a heater coil and set your car on fire when you try. If you want to charge a cell phone, an iPad, etc. on it, go ahead, no problem. But the problem is, most people buy an extension cord for a cigarette lighter to do something with a heavy amp load outside of the vehicle. This WILL NOT support a heavy amp load."
77478,After a couple of episodes Sherlock really began to emote which was something missing in the first episodes. Watson is good and getting more believable. Great story line. Love it
77479,Everyday when I got home from school I watched schoolhouse rock. It amazes me how many of the songs I remember. Kids today should have a look at these.
77480,next to the last season and no end in sight.boyd is boyd and raylan is same.art the only sane one is almost insane.maybe theo will blow them all up and asit seems to be going . ??
77481,It's beyond SNL delivered in the style of Lloyd Bridges ala Airplane.  Pretty funny.  The 'love scene' at the end just cracked me up.  I'd watch more of this for sure.  Bring it on!!
77482,"While I have only watched a few episodes it is a well done show by Investigators who all a have experience from others show such as Destination truth and Fact or Fake, it is shot in a style somewhat like the Ghost Adventures with a touch of the Blair witch project tossed in.  The investigations are new and fresh not just rehashing of the same subjects seen on other shows.  For the price it is worth watching.  If you like myself are an aficionado of the genre then it is worth a watch."
77483,"Smart and funny. I have to admit I didn't really expect much, but was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. Smartly written, and the characters/actors have good chemistry. Nice to see Karan Soni from Safety Not Guaranteed. I'm also a big Jon Daly fan and had no idea he was in this. Great to see him here and he was very funny. Also, Ed Begely Jr. is always fantastic, and a fun cameo from Moby. So far the other reviews seem to be largely positive, so I hope this show gets a fair shake. If I have any complaints, it would only be that there seemed to be a good deal noticeably ADR'd lines. Hopefully that can be worked out in future episodes."
77484,"Simple plug in hookup  for most modern vehicles with a trailer hitch set up.  Color coded instructions if you must wire directly.  Bright and  very cool looking on your vehicle.  Recommend doing a preview  test before permanent attaching, to make sure you have it turned the correct way etc.  Comes with double sided tape or brackets for permanent attachment, you will also need a drill for the bracket attachment method.  Works with Brakes, Running Lights, Reverse Lights & Signals."
77485,"I purchased this to upgrade the horn on my Miata. Louder than stock with a nice tone. The install wasn't bad; you do not need a relay. I've also used a Nautilus compact air horn. The tone of the Nautilus is much nicer, much higher, which I like. The volume is similar between the two. The one thing I don't like about the Nautilus is it needs routine maintenance. Over time, you need to spray WD-40 into the horn opening of Nautilus to keep it working. This restores its performance. The Piaa, being an electric horn, is not affected by extreme cold like the Nautilus, nor does it require maintenance. It is a nice upgrade, but if I had to purchase again, I would choose the Nautilus."
77486,"I caught some grief with my initial review--with good cause.  I returned and carefully watched all of the first episode and have revised my rating to 3 stars.  It was okay--but formulaic and hurried.  The main female lead's acting began rather stilted but was beginning to improve as the episode progressed.  The predictable ""hunk"" with the 2012 police force, linked with the usual gun battle, the lame interrogation scene, and the gimmicky body suit, left me cold.  The characters needed much more early development so we actually cared about any of them, and were basically one-dimensional.  Perhaps subsequent episodes will eventually get to working on this.  Sure, it's science fiction and not expected to be reality-based, but the wildly improbable scene where a group execution turned inexplicably into time travel, left me groaning and rolling my eyes.  Way more background leading up to this would have been very welcome to make it more plausible.  The time travelers are a stereotypic group of personality-disorderd misfits and, even though they are presumably the ""good guys"", none were in the least bit likeable or sufficiently intelligent to have ever invented time travel.  I plan to try episode 2 but if the superficial plot and shallow characterization doesn't pick up soon, it may be my last."
77487,"Per the usual, Meyers oozes sex with every role.I thought his American accent was corny but maybe that was part of the show...I recently read this show is likely to be cancelled so if you don't want to be disappointed if the show isn't renewed then I would pass.They left a lot of room to develop the story of the secondary characters but I don't know how they could have prolonged Dracula's story, maybe if they started him younger like they did with the Tudors."
77488,Sherlock Holmes as he would have been if he were born in this century. Very good series and great stories.
77489,Needed for our Camco Outdoor mats for when several are put together and there aren't any other gourmets on the one.
77490,This is an enjoyable series. I love seeing a young female having such strength. There was a time in the recent past that such ability in a woman was seldom if ever in Media.
77491,"This is a great product if you are like me and prefer using natural pool products instead of swimming in chemicals. This is the second product you use to keep the phosphates down after using phos free. Phos free brings phosphates down, pool perfect plus phos free is the maintenance step to keep them in check. Algae feed on phosphates, so remove the food bye bye algae. Note when algae die they put off phosphates as well. Once you get phosphates under 500 you can use this.If you have an algae bloom like I did before finding this stuff this company also has a super concentrate called first aid. I used a product called banish as I did not know about first aid at the time. I slowly reduced the phosphates after the outbreak although you can dump a whole jug without any issues.You must still watch your chlorine levels and don't let them drop, but you can use less chlorine, or in my case turn the salt water generator down some."
77492,this show is hilarious. It is great to watch while hanging out with friends. I can't wait to watch the new season
77493,"It works great for five of my lower power pedal type items, including my Line 6 wireless receivers, Shure wireless receivers, and several other pedals like my Cry Baby, etc., all at once.  However, the transmitter for my Shure wireless in-ear monitor, which requires less power than any of the other two items combined, will not run, even by itself, when powered by the 1 Spot.  Switching power supplies like this can have a mind of their own, and there is probably some little quirk in the Shure transmitter circuit that this power supply doesn't get along with.  For most of my stuff it works great, and eliminates a bunch of extra power supplies and cords."
77494,"This very intelligent and entertaining series is finally coming to an end.  I, for one, am caught up in the game: Who's the last Cylon?  I don't think that the series creators are going to go for the clich&eacute; ""it's the Admiral or the President"", but for the life of me, I don't know who that leaves.The entire series has been an adventure that parallels our current political atmosphere but translates it into a sci-fi journey.  This is what this genre does best - it holds up the fun house mirror for us to view ourselves in a distorted perspective.The mood of BSG tends to be quite ""Film Noir"".  When I looked up a definition in Wikipedia I found the following:""Film noir is often described as essentially pessimistic. The noir stories that are regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations (which, in general, they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating), striving against random, uncaring fate, and frequently doomed. The movies are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt. Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era.""I thought this was a pretty good account of all seasons of BSG.  Another film noir factor to take into account is the general moral ambiguity.  It seems that the Cylons are the ones who are now taking the moral high ground and seem to be more open to weighing the pros and cons of each ethical decision.  They are becoming the principled ones and the humans have adapted an ethos of ""if it's different, it's bad!"" and not to be trusted.  Lifelong friendships are dismissed in an instant if this person (entity) turns out to be a ""toaster"".This may be a foolish question but I wonder if the Earth they found is real? I'm going to miss this show.  The acting, writing, directing, music and all other aspects are a tribute to each and every person connected with this fine series...bg"
77495,"Discovered the series by accident, visiting family and ordered from Amazon.  Every series has come in perfect, new condition with amazing speed.  Just need the 5th season now!"
77496,"Out of all the Chemical Guys products I've purchased, this is my least favorite or ideal product...Mainly because... IT LEAKS (as a product solution, it's more problematic than it actually solves).Although to solve the leaking problem w/ any 3 bottles it must maintain a perfect upright position !!If you keep it in your car and it tilts over to it's side ...you'll be leaking $$ product. Something youdidn't expect to happen. The spray nozzle-tip doesn't &#34;cap-off&#34; shut (as a normal sprayer would),so this means the &#34;slightest&#34; touch or &#34;nudge&#34; of the trigger will set it off & shoot/drip a stream of$$ product. Another thing you didn't expect to happen and yet another thing to wipe down. Eachof the sprayers has a serious &#34;hair-trigger&#34; on them and it's leak (when tilted); IT ISN'T PERFECT.The only thing keeping it from rating it a 1 or 2 is due to the fact of how it &#34;Sprays&#34;...when used...The &#34;trigger-action&#34; and the &#34;mist-ing&#34; (of the $$ product) results are damn near perfect !! It doesproduce an &#34;even and uniform&#34; mist (in my case: CG Detailer Spray) ,,, PERFECTLY. But, overall,with a bottle that leaks, no shut-off cap, and with the hair-trigger... I'd have a hard time endorsingthis specific (16oz sprayer) product from CG to other people."
77497,"Great characters, great plot lines!  Given that the season / series was ending - enjoyed the wrap-up.  The writers rushed a threads of the story to complete the ending, but well worth the time."
77498,"This is a great filter for the money. It's equal to the Mobil 1 M1-110, but cheaper. I use this filter on my motorcycle with good results."
77499,This is very well made and hopefully holds up to the sun which usually discolors the plate covers. Can't complain on the Bell cover so far.
77500,"They work great, they're quiet and they're cheap. What else can you ask for? I'm very happy with the product"
77501,A funny light hearted look at the people who run the show.  Just folks in a crazy place and time
77502,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing a unit I received for free through the Vine program.Well it is a decent string trimmer. Here's what I compare it to/against: I hate gas trimmers, have 2 broken ones that won't start (one 2-cycle, one 4-cycle), cluttering up the garage. I also have a smaller Worx cordless electric trimmer (with 18V NiCad battery; &lt;http://www.amazon.com/WG150-1-10-Inch-18-Volt-Cordless-Electric/dp/B000NKPCDM>), and a broken ancient Black & Decker EdgeHog cordless electric trimmer that died years ago.Pros:* It is cordless electric, not gas. did I mention that I hate gas string trimmers and have 2 broken ones?* It is well balanced, so even with a slightly heavier battery up top, overall it's not too tiring to carry and wave around for a while.* For an electric trimmer, it is relatively ""heavy duty"" (slightly thicker string, and larger spool holding more string, than the Worx electric trimmer; longer handle too). I was surprised that it was able to whack some pretty thick-stemmed nasty weeds, and some nasty tenacious vines (thanks to global warming, we get more and more nasty vines every year lately).* It comes in the middle price range, for cordless electric trimmers -- more than the $60 Worx GT 18V (http://www.amazon.com/WG150-1-10-Inch-18-Volt-Cordless-Electric/dp/B000NKPCDM) but less than some Black & Decker's.* The 24V lithium battery does last longer than NicCad batteries of lower voltage (in the Worx, where there was actually a recall & free replacement last year, of bad old batteries). or compared to the ancient Black & Decker EdgeHog whose battery died like 7 years ago. We have a few acres although I only need to weed-whack small areas around the house; still it takes over an hour to do a complete job; in the 2 times I've used this Toro electric trimmer so far this season, the battery lasted most of the way, though not all the way (I had to switch to the Worx electric trimmer to finish the job, after this one's battery finally gave out).Cons:* The edge guard was a joke. It snapped off and got lost, after the first 45 seconds of use, in a heavy patch of weeds, and I never found it again!* The automatic string advance doesn't work, not for me at least. Even the manual advance button doesn't work for me either. So I have to take off the cap from the spool, and manually lift the spool up to let out a few turns of string, every time I need to advance some. Now maybe I've got something screwed in the wrong way, I don't know, but I've tried removing the spool and putting it back, twisting this way and that, and still nothing works, neither the automatic advance nor the manual button.(contrast this with the Worx electric trimmer, which has smaller spools and thinner cord, BUT the automatic advance works great there)* The spool refills aren't free (contrast with Worx electric trimmer, which offers free replacement spools for life! you just pay shipping & handling)* It does cost more than the Worx GT 18V, which does have the free lifetime spool replacements, plus you can buy a 2nd battery for the Worx, to make up for its shorter battery life, total still less than this Toro's price. The Worx did have a horrible problem with its batteries going dead after just a few uses, but Worx has a recall + free replacement program now, for the bad batteries, so you might give the Worx a try to save some money.*  It does only have one string outlet from the spool, so there's only 1 piece of cord flying/cutting, which is typical for electric trimmers; gas trimmers, on the other hand, usually have 2. ALthough the trade-off is that with only 1 outlet for 1 length of string, you also don't have double windings of 2 separate cord lengths in the spool/housing, so this one is much simpler than those in gas trimmers."
77503,Just love this show! What a wonderful re-make of the original UK version of the Tomorrow People. This show is very modern and keeps you at the edge of your seat. I hope there is a season 2 because it's like the movie Jumper but for television!
77504,Revenge from the pilot episode has been on the edge of your seat riveting LOVE ITCant wait for the next showing
77505,Alton Brown is engaging and funny all while teaching you how and why you prepare food the way you do. Great for learning chemistry in baking.  I highly recommend it to pros and baking beginners.
77506,"This has it all, high drama, credible plot, family feuds, emotional highs and lows , the thin line between good guys and bad guys.  When does a cop cross the line and become a bad guy as Dennis Quade comes close to teaming up with the mob.  The mob, on the other hand, has its good guys and bad guys and at times you really like the bad guy who becomes a good guy just trying to keep his job, just like any other corporate manager. There is something for everyone here, love, sensuality, intrigue, intelligence, mystery, tough guys and sexy women.  What's not to like?  Keep this show going, its a keeper."
77507,"Although I have come to the conclusion that where a product is made is no important to me (it is made in China), I am giving this bird-feeder four stars because it is well-made and very attractive. It looks just like a barn on my daughter's farm. It is red, has a weathervane on top, windows and a metal roof. It is supposed to be a deterrent for squirrels who sit on the bar because they weigh too much. Our backyard squirrels hang upside down on the post and get into anything, but so far they  have not been attracted to this feeder. I have the old feeder up in the backyard and the birds loved it. It is just blue and clear plastic- we stopped putting birdseed in it when the new Perky-Pet Country House feeder arrived. It has been up for six-days and today is the first day that I was able to observe a sparrow actually eating seeds from it.  Apparently, the birds are taking their sweet time in adjusting to their new source of bird food.  We feed our squirrels peanuts I buy by the sack and because we gave a resident feral cat who is blind and old, we also get a possum and very big raccoon coming to our back-door to eat cat food and drink fresh water. This bird-feeder is an attractive addition to our small back yard and I trust that in time our usual back yard birds (Cardinals, Finches, etc.)  will return. The Mourning Doves eat the seed that falls to the ground and since there hasn't been that much activity at the new red feeder, they too aren't visiting us too frequently. I am giving them all time to adjust to their new food source.Well, here is an update: after using this bird house for approximately two months, it has broken. The metal rod that holds the rooster on top (this secures the top of the opening where seeds are poured into) has vanished. This morning I found the roof of the birdhouse on the ground and cannot find the rest of the pieces anywhere. Perhaps an outraged squirrel or large bird came along and broke it to get at the seeds inside. I now would recommend that you do not buy this bird feeder unless you just want it for decoration."
77508,"Purchased the first one for myself, re-ordered more for my Wife and children.  Amazing product, exceptionally useful, leaves zero sticky residue.  Do yourself a favor and get this."
77509,"I got this based on all the reviews I read.  I read other reviews of tire shine and they said they didn't last long, sprayed everywhere after application, shine not good.  So I got this stuff and the bottle was bigger than I thought.  You get a pretty big bottle for the price.  And this is quality stuff.  Just spray it on tires like it says and let it sit for like 5-6 minutes.  It pretty much dries to the tire, with some drips that you can wipe away with a microfiber cloth.  Excellent shine to it as well, close to the Tire Foam I used to use which is what I was looking for.  I still think Tire Foam shines a little better, but this stuff will probably last longer than that stuff only lasted a few days.  This stuff is thick and feels like it should keep the tire looking black for at least a week.  Mother's is a great brand.  This is my first experience with them and they remind me of another company and for like 1/4 of the price."
77510,"I love BBQ. For convenience I have often used a gas grill, but really do love the taste of meat cooked over charcoal (PAH and NCA risks notwithstanding). I have often cooked turkey breasts for Thanksgiving, and particularly love the smokey flavor that comes with it! Alongside baked potatoes and fresh veggies (extra nice on the grill), I have a special meal that is actually healthy.So when my last gas grill bit the dust, we went back to the old fashioned way of cooking! Real charcoal, real delicious smell, real delicious flavor! I suggest that you consider using theWeber 7416 Rapidfire Chimney Starter, so that you can have the purest taste without any chemical oders.A funny thing happened when a dear friend came by to visit ... Her son was entranced by the fact that we didn't have any fuel for our BBQ.  Times change, but old fashioned flavor doesn't. This grill made  the move with us recently and now sits on our new deck waiting for spring, or at least a nice sunny day!"
77511,"it clenas very well using the gilmoure foam gun, nice suds, better then other shampoos, but it leaves still soap spotes on paint, but much less than other products, and leaves the car with a nice shine, may be what i need is a pressure washer , maybe then the results will be even better with zero water or soap spots, but at the end its an excellent product, compared to other car shampoos, and i will keep using it in the future."
77512,More of Jack Bauer and his over the top method of saving America from terrorists. Very intense at tomes. Enjoy all of it.
77513,This was the one items that many Ford enthusiast site recommended for the f150's with the eco-boost to cover the big hole. No exception this thing fit the gap perfect. It was easy to install. and well made. Most people think it is a standard feature of the 2013 F150 that I drive.
77514,"This thing works just like you'd expect and has all the connection options you need.  I mainly wanted it to use as a backup power supply, paired with a 12V deep cycle battery, in case of a power outage.  I hook it to the battery with the alligator clips (included), turn it on and it works no problem.  It recharges my Android phone (via USB) and I tested it with a 200W personal heater (via 2 prong plug) and that worked just fine with the 12V battery.The cigarette lighter is a nice option too, basically giving you a generic way to power devices without having to get the ""car adapter"" for that particular device.  Note, though, the warning that cigarette lighters are for 100W.  If you want 500W you need a battery to connect to with the alligator clips.Basically if you have this, a 12V battery and a battery tender/charger, you've got a nice, generic home backup power supply which, while not remotely as robust as a generator, is a cheap and convenient way to power your gadgets in a power outage."
77515,"I already own aMighty Bright LED Book Light with one lighting head, but I bought this light as a semi-permanent fixture on myDocument/Book Holder, which is mounted on anarticulating arm(took a little DIY'ing).This music light has one drawback; it doesn't have a master switch. To turn on both lights, you would have to independently turn on the switch atop each light head (two switch presses). To turn off both lights, you would have to independently double-click each light head (four switch presses) -- the first press brings the light to a lower level and the second press turns it off (each light head has two light levels: bright and medium-bright -- for a total 4 illumination combinations).I use this light for music sheets, documents, and books. The &#34;mighty bright&#34; label is no misnomer to be sure; these lights ARE mighty bright. They provide more than enough illumination to make even smaller texts readable in low ambient light conditions. Each light head provides very even illumination for a letter size sheet (the light starts to get dimmer just beyond the fringes of the sheet), so two light heads will provide sufficient illumination for a good-sized area. It will simultaneously illuminate the verso and recto of even the largest books. The flexible goose necks of the music light allows you to easily position the lights to reduce glare (which is inevitable on glossy or semi-glossy pages).This music light is a mighty sweet deal because:(1) it comes with anAC Adapter(which doesn't come with the book light with a single lighting head and has to be purchased separately). The adapter works on both this music light and the book light with a single lighting head.(2) contrary to the product description, this music light DOES come with 3 AAA batteries (at least mine did).Important Note: If you switch from using batteries to using the AC Adapter, the 3 AAA batteries will first have to be removed from the battery housing or the light(s) won't power on.I picked this music light over theMighty Bright Orchestra Lightbecause:(1) I've had my single head book light for many years and I trust this book light to offer the same durability (both lights are indistinguishable save for the single/dual light heads)(2) two goose necks offer more lighting flexibility(3) this music light is about half the price of the orchestra light.---The Bottom Line: The lack of a master switch on this music light makes turning on/off the lights somewhat of a hassle (an unfortunate but tolerable drawback). All the same, this music light is very functional, and as far as durability is concerned, I'm quite confident that it will last me for many years to come (it has the same build quality as my Mighty Bright single-head book light, which I've had for many years). Recommended!"
77516,The shine is pretty good and it still shined after 3 consecutive rain days. A little lasts a long way so use thin multiple coats instead of one thick coat. I had a little difficulty buffing off the haze at first (cos I let it dry too long) but i applied a few drops of water on the cloth and the haze came off pretty easily.
77517,"I bought this used from the Amazon warehouse.  I have a small yard and I was surprised at how much bigger and more expensive the trimmers had gotten since the last time I bought one.  The used one from the warehouse was under $30 and included free shipping.  It arrived in perfect condition, including one double spool of line already installed, and a spare that is full.  As far as its operation, it is working perfectly for me.  It seemed a little heavy for its size at first but I quickly got used to it.  The auto feed is working perfectly and I like the feel of it during operation. And finally, this thing may be on the cheaper, smaller side, but trust me, its darn powerful enough to take down anything most people will have in mind for it.  I had no problem cutting down anything I tried it on.  It was very impressive in that sense...As far as any negatives to it, there are a couple of small issues.  One is the fact that even though the shaft on this thing is adjustable, it really doesn't get very long.  I'm not a tall guy and I still have to bend over some to use it.  Not really uncomfortable for me, but it could be an issue on a tall person.  Also, even though the auto feed is working fine for me, I have mixed feelings about it.  It feeds new line every time it you start it or restart it.  Whether it needs new line or not.  This is rather wasteful to me, and I have a tendency to walk around with it on to save line.  Not really that much of an inconvenience, but sometimes the old bump system doesn't seem so bad.  Some of the other reviewers here talk about the auto feed system jamming and having to pull the line out manually once in a while.  But in all fairness, that happened to me all the time with my old bump style system too, so I can't hold it against this one with its auto feed feature..In conclusion, when it comes to smaller trimmers these days, they have unfortunately gone the way of the biggest and baddest in many respects, as well as gas models really taking a bigger part of market. Not much to choose from in the smaller, less powerhouse models now. I have no need for either a big trimmer, nor do I want to mess with a gas one that I have never had any luck with in the past anyway.  This Greenworks model is quality made, works very well, and is one of the only real choices for a smaller unit that still has some respectable power to it. I got mine for a bargain price used, but feel that it is worth every bit of the money they are asking for it new.  I love mine and highly recommend it... : )PS:  This weeder takes a double line spool, that is currently unavailable, and according to the description is also ""discontinued by manufacturer"".  Unfortunate for its so much easier to just install a pre loaded spool.  However you can still buy the .065 line and wind it yourself.  That's what I did for years with my old trimmer, and will with this.."
77518,"Wow, unexpectedly great show--I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Dr. Lightman (Tim Roth) doesn't just read facial cues to tell when folks are lying--he's pretty darn good at telling lies himself. This show is fresh, original, and addictive. I never would have thought the show would work with Tim Roth in the lead but he's terrific as are the other 2 main characters--you want to know what's going to happen to these people. And unlike another reviewer I liked how season 1 ended. These folks who study the science of lying have a gift, and that gift is both a blessing & a curse as you will see thru the first 13 episodes. Can't wait for season 2."
77519,"If you are on the hunt for a new thrilling and suspenceful horror flick, then IFC Midnight's latest release, Rites Of Spring, is the one for you. Written and directed by Padraig Reynolds, Rites Of Spring brings the thriller and horror genres together in perfect harmony. This film delivers on all cylinders with an exciting story line, a believable cast and tons-o-gore.While two stories are being intercut during this film, one being more of a thriller and the other a straight-up horror piece, Rites Of Spring delivers a perfect marrige between the two. With a creepy old farmer preying on young women in one, and a kidnapping that doesn't go as planned in the parallel tale, a great deal of mystery plays out in both.The cast found within this film are all lesser known/unknown actors who obviously have a passion for film. Anessa Ramsey delivers a spine-tingling performance as the character Rachel and after this film, she is destined to be called upon for many more horror roles in the future. From her line delivery to her trembling hands, Ramsey's screen presence is remarkable to say the least.As the film progresses, the blood begins to spill more and more. There are a few effects, that looked to be done with After Effects, that can be done without, but overall the look and realism of the gore is well above average. A round of applause must be give to the practical effects crew as well as the members of this production who came up with the look of the mysterious monster-like killer. This very scary and realistc looking crazy killer dons old rags and maggots as he brutely murders his victims.Rites Of Spring was a surprisingly fun and blood filled ride from begining to end."
77520,"This stand is small, compact, and sturdy.  It holds my tenor uke just fine, and when folded, fits into the pocket of my uke case.  It's perfect to take along to a gig or practice, and therefore have a safe place to put the uke down."
77521,Great story line and continuity from episode to episode.  Falling skies should be around for many more seasons.  Have been a fan of Noah Wyle since his ER days and the Libranian episodes.
77522,"Small enough to keep along with your guitar to make sure it is in tune each time you play a little. I wish it was a little faster but it is close to as fast as my Sony and Korg plug in tuners. It clips onto the guitar easily, stays put, and is not intrusive by weight or size. The bars are easy to see and are accurate."
77523,Really enjoyable and much more believeable than some other monster hunting shows. I really hope that one day they will find something that convinces Ranae that Sasquatch does exist.
77524,Had this strap for 20 years now and still going on strong. Just a simple well made product that does the job. Perfect for those who use the instrument very high on the chest. Looks classic too!
77525,Great product.  I have at least ten of these.  I wish I could buy the tripod without the brass sprinkler head.  I replace those with Naan quiet heads.  I hope Orbit maintains the quality.  The two I bought yesterday seem to have cheaper connector.
77526,"Used to see so many of these type replacement trimmer units sold on TV and always figured they were junk.Now they all seem to be gone from the marketplace except for two types that I found, I bought this one because it uses plain heavy duty .095 trimmer line and not special made blades that might be hard to find at some point.This can be set up to use 2 or 4 sections of line (bent double to be 4 or 8) I've been using it with only 2(4) so far and it works at least as well as my old stock unit that kept needing repairs and wasting line.Cutting pretty well, but makes the engine seem to run a bit slower and I feel the need to give it more throttle.I might try it with all 4 lines at some point to see if there is an improvement in cut, but happy as is and saves line too. (8 lines in use after you fold them over and insert) not sure what all 4(8) lines will do to the RPM range however, might not let my engine come up to full speed.This same item is also sold under the ""Rino-Tuff"" brand, but made by the same company.Check the pre cut replacement string package, for just a dollar or so more you can get 100ft of .095 line and cut 100 pcs pretty quick.Was quick and easy to install and has given no trouble so far with a few hours of cutting with it. (still the same line that came with the unit)They claim 20x the life for the line, but who knows.. even if it gets the same life per foot as the old coil loaded in, it's still easier to deal with no mechanical parts and uses low cost rolls of line.On the subject of line life, one thing to keep in mind is that when you do wear line it is not replaced by more from a spool so just gets shorter and shorter.. how long will you keep using it at it's shortest length before you put in new line?  A variable that will cause owners to report different findings on line wear times I'm sure.Claims to fit 99% of the gas trimmers out there, but no way one person can know if this is true.  Does come with a good assorment of sizes for nuts and bolts to fit what you have though.No way to know how this will hold up, but time will tell and I'll be back to say if it didn't do well 8-)NOTE;  Be sure to read the comments attached to this review before you buy"
77527,"The show is good and it's fitting for our how our culture revolves around technology and the companies that make it.  If anything, it shows how Silicon Valley will pay any amount of money for a goofy idea - a realistic and funny notion.  The characters aren't deep, but they each have potential for growth.  The leader will lead and go after the VC girl, the older guy will prank everyone and be a general goof, the young guy will pine after the girl, and the ""smart"" guy will be neurotic and funny.  A formula that can work."
77528,"I was very excited to see a new show by the ladies who formally did Blue's Clues as it's still one of our faves.I watched the pilot with my 3 year old. She was mesmerized even with the rough cut. We are an arts and craft family, always doing a new project, so we really loved the whole arts theme.I think it's a great concept and also feels a lot like Blues Clues in the way things are presented. It really engages the preschooler and educates them in a way that is different from the typical letters, numbers, and reading that other preschool shows do."
77529,The acting and writing are sensational and I can't wait for Season 2! I particularly like Annabeth Gish's ice queen portrayal of a widowed gold digger. Deserves Emmys all around.
77530,"I own 5 of these, one for each of my cars.  I find the Accutire gauges to all be consistent with one another, and they all match the pressure reading of my far more expensive garage dial gauge (within .5 psi)."
77531,If anyone knows about fuel pumps ? The best way to save your fuel pump is to keep a clean fuel filter.Well just so happens the best fuel filter is ACDelco.
77532,"This series gets a bit beyond lackluster stereotypes except for the therapy part where platitudes seem to be the cure for every ill.  Dani is an o.k. therapist, I guess, but most deluded when it comes to her own relationships.  Matt is a trip down memory lane hoping and praying for a do-over of her past.  Nico represents the future and, I wish, a much better prospect for a mature and grown-up Dani looking ahead.  These two very different men are the subtext to the overall theme of a therapist with high-powered clients who play games for a living.  Dani, though diminutive in size, can stand up to the toughest client both emotionally and physically.  There is enough of a story line where another season would be appreciated.  However, the ""getting real"" is as much of an issue for the writers of this series as it is for their characters, Dani especially."
77533,Just like the others have stated. It came with chipped paint. Fit in the receiver very loose. I am going to use it when I need it. But the chips were most likely from the was it was packaged for shipping. The loose fit is from the manfacturer not doing their homework and taking their proper measurments. Fits to loose.
77534,"I bought this along with alot of others to make my own starter kit by chemical guys. The product applys very easy and with almost to effort. The product when on the car provides a really nice glass like finish on the car that looks very sharp. The only reason that it dident get 5 stars is that it doesent really have a anti static finish about it, it tend to allow things like pollen attach to it. Overall though it cleans really easy when things get on it."
77535,"These are no cheaper, or smaller than any of the name brand pads - but they cost a fraction of the price.  I use these to wax, and to apply leather conditioner.  They've worked great, and I have no problem recommending them to others!"
77536,"I received a sample size a while ago, used it on my family's vehicles and not only did it made my cars look great, it protected from the harsh salt and salt brines the city uses to treat the roads in the winter months.Has a nice scent to it as well, so it makes application a breeze....wipes off fairly easy once dried...just make sure to apply super thin....I used my DA polisher.I was sooo pleased with this sample I ordered a 64oz bottle from amazon....but unfortunately, the bottle arrived with a crack on the bottom and the contents leaked out :(This bottle was ordered from Amazon Warehouse deals...it appears they don't pack fragile items very well.Great sealant but poor packaging from Amazon."
77537,"Yes, it's another cop show...and it's a good one...with a dark, serious edge, yet retaining sober realism and pacing without relying on over the top, hyper-graphic situations and visuals, so often used as an easy crutch to artificially impart dramatic tension for the ADHD generation.  Make this one, Amazon."
77538,"I don't know what to write. This show is bad. Corny dialogue, vague apocalyptic event that has caused mayhem in the world and uninteresting characters. Not for me."
77539,"All the actors were excellent.  Pilot grabbed my interest.  Can't really judge if I would keep watching until 2 or 3 more episodes.  Will it get too funky/bizarre?  It is skirting that line and I like that, but if once it gets too too unbelievable and weird would likely drop it.  Jeffrey one of the very best living character actors.  Very cute in lipstick!"
77540,"This Duracell ""Powerpack 600"" works well to jump start cars (we have used it twice now) and as a portable AC source while camping (used it twice on extended trips). We bought this to replace an olderXantrex XPower Powerpack 400 Plus Portable Backup Power Sourcethat no longer holds a charge after six years. This Duracell unit has more ""cranking"" power and also powers my electronics longer when camping, so I am pleased with the general performance.We have also used the AC output to power a GPS enabled telescope and it easily lasted for the three hours or so we were in the field.My major issues with this are relatively minor, but worth mentioning. The charging adapter does not store in the unit, the clock can not be disabled, and the radio quality is marginal (picks up very few stations compared to my other radios).This is was a good choice for me since the positives outweigh the few negatives for my uses.Recommended!CFH"
77541,The stand arrived very quickly.  Came in a few pieces but took all of about 45 seconds to put it together.  the neck is adjustable which will allow it to hold multiple sized guitar.  Excellent product.
77542,"Upon getting the spray, I had a hard time getting the sprayer to prime up. It took about 5 minutes or so of opening and closing the nozzle and holding my finger on it blocking the spray hole to get it started. Once i did, it was very good. It has an easy adjustable spray tip that goes from an almost mist to stream. There's just a slight smell from it but its nothing offensive at all, reminded me of yogurt. It has a slight milky color to it which is nice because you can see where you've sprayed. The main ingredients are egg, capsacian and garlic. Pretty simple ingredients and the label says its harmless to animals and humans. I believe its USDA approved for organic gardens which means it should be safe but one never really knows.I've only had this a few days and will update in a few weeks but so far, the squirrels aren't attacking by bird feeders. They can't resist sunflower seeds which are for the birds not them and climb right up the thin wrought iron plant hangers. I wanted to give this a try because I can't spend all day chasing them away. They keep the birds from coming and can go thru the entire feeder in no time flat. You'll get a batch of squirrels that are very bold so I hope this stuff continues to keep they off the feeders. I don't care about the grounds but not on the feeders. I sprayed the polls and the feeders, without getting the openings for the seeds. I also sprayed the surrounding grass and plants under and around the feeders.The birds don't seem effected at all. They eat from the feeders and the grounds under them with no apparent issues. There were a few squirrels but they didn't stick around long. Not sure if it was the spray or that they saw me watching them...lol.  Again, I'll update this in a few short weeks and give my final thoughts. Keep your fingers crossed!UPDATE 6-14-12:No Good, it seemed to work for a few days but now the squirrels are back and climbing up the plant hooks again. I sprayed the hooks and the bird feeders till they were dripping with the spray and it didn't stop them. Oh well! on to other inventions."
77543,"If you haven't read the book, you might like this.  Other reviewers have said it all!  I do recommend the book."
77544,What can i say?  this is a xlr cable.i just have to stress if you want gear that will last for a while and not have a crappy connection somewhere buy decent cables.This one has quality ends on it and that makes me happy that this investment will last years down the road.So buy a decent quality cable like this one and not the cheapest!
77545,"I am a Destination Truth Junkie! I love the show and waited anxiously for the season to start. But it seems to me that it ended just as quickly as it began. There are only 7 episodes to this season?? Totally not enough! I am sure it takes much longer to make an episode than any of us could possibly imagine, but there must be more?"
77546,Quality show and safe and fun entertainment for the whole family.  There are not many shows out there that you can say this about.  A & E had better keep with this show or another network will have no trouble scooping them up into their line up. :)
77547,Handle and adapter are well built and performed as expected. Cheaper than in any of my local RV dealers by about $.50 to $1.00.
77548,"My 20-month-old daughter loves this show!  It's cute and not annoying like some kids shows.  I like that the animation is simple, too."
77549,there is a good balance for much drama and they do not disappoint .  I found I like this show more than I may have intended when I purchased it.  I'm a fan now.
77550,"Overall I enjoyed the story of the movie and I felt like the visuals and environment supported the overall feel of this dark supernatural medieval tale. It left me wanting more from this world. I liked that the 'hero' actually did not just waltz around winning every fight.. he took some nasty hits and nearly died himself.Pros:Great StoryDark and Realistic WorldBadass Anti-HeroAwesome Evil SorcererGreat ActingCons:Lots of Blood (This seemed to fit for me, but it could be a negative for some.)Death of Innocents Including Children (But boy does it explain Kane's determination.)"
77551,I liked the clay-mation effect of the animation.  The premise is good and the characters were funny. I will definitely watch this show if they make more.
77552,Interesting
77553,My 2 yr old grandson loves watching Diago. This is a great program that helps kids learn some verbal skills.
77554,"Walter White's (Bryan Cranston) life is not what he expected nor wanted. A mild mannered high school chemistry teacher, he just turns 50 as the show starts. His wife is expecting another child, his first some is a well adjusted 16 year old with cp and life for Walter is just, well boring.Walter's job doesn't hold the glamour for him that it did when he began. After years of teaching (or at least trying to teach) kids chemistry and trying to pass along his passion for this knowledge, he now faces a generation that more so than the rest just doesn't care or take an interest. His second job working at a car wash results in an extra income but more degradation as the owner routinely disrespects him and has him do menial jobs.The worst finally comes around when Walter collapses at the car wash and is rushed to the hospital. Not informing his family, Walter is told by the doctors there that he has terminal, inoperable lung cancer. Where does one go when their entire world collapses around them?For Walter it comes in the form of his brother-in-law, a tough talking jovial DEA agent named Hank (Dean Norris). Cajoled by Hank time and again, he takes him up on his offer to go on a ride along when then next meth lab bust takes place. There is method to Walter's madness here. He wants to get a glimpse of the set up being used with plans of making meth on his own to sell and make a fortune that he can then leave his family. Fate steps in as Walter sees a young man escape from the house next door and recognizes him as Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), an ex-student of his.Walter tracks down Jesse and offers him a proposition. He wants to be the chemist involved in making the meth that Jesse would then in turn distribute. A straight business deal that would yield them both a nice wad of cash. To do so they need a place to cook and with the DEA seeking out houses being used, Walter comes up with a plan. A Winnebago, a meth lab on wheels.They get set up, make their first batch and Jesse is stunned by the purity of the product. Walter gets in a poke at Jesse concerning his ability to listen and learn, something he didn't seem to do in high school. Had he done so in chemistry class, he would have learned the tools he needed to become a major drug provider.So here we have the set up. This is a true anti-hero if there ever was one. A mild mannered suburbanite turned into a major drug dealer? Yes this is the basis for the series. But don't misunderstand. It doesn't glorify the drug culture or Walter's decision to create drugs. The story more involves Walter's attempt to do a good deed in providing for his family but at the same time making decisions that place himself and them in jeopardy. It's more about living with your wrong decisions and watching as Walter and Jesse attempt to save themselves from the decisions they made.As the series progresses (only 7 episodes) we watch as Walter comes to life. Perhaps it's the sense of danger, perhaps the fact that he is living outside of his comfort zone or perhaps it's that he is facing death by cancer that has made Walter change. We see him move from mild mannered chemistry teacher to a man willing to walk into the home base of a wild and jacked up drug dealer to demand respect and money.But the series isn't just about that. It's also about his wife and her love of her husband as she tries to understand his change, not knowing until halfway through the series that he has cancer. It's about his son dealing not only with his own problems but with a father he loves but hasn't quite learned to respect. It's about a man driven so far to the edge that he gets involved with drug manufacturing even though his brother-in-law is a DEA agent. It's about a man who when faced with what he feels are no options, turns to the darkest part of his soul. It's about life as we probably all wish we never have to experience.The series is not just a hard edged drama though. Throughout the escapades of Walter and Jesse we get plenty of actual laughs. Whether it's Walter standing in the middle of a road in his tighty whiteys with a gun he doesn't know how to use or Walter grabbing his wife's thigh in the midst of a PTA meeting, there are some truly funny moments.When I first heard of this show it didn't interest me, it didn't sound like something I'd like. The more I watched it on DVD though, the more invested in these characters I became. I liked Walter but not what he did. I felt for Jesse but wished he seek treatment. And I hoped that this family would find a way to survive everything that happened to them.It might not be the cup of tea that the average renter would enjoy. But the dark humor, the danger and the interest in the main character make this compelling viewing as it progresses. Cranston and Paul do a fantastic job as an odd couple for the current state of affairs. And once the series ends, you find yourself looking forward to season two (coming out on DVD soon as well as season 3 starting on AMC in March 2010).One thing that has to be mentioned again about this series. It's the story of a man who produces crystal meth. It would be easy to write the series off as an homage to meth dealers and manufacturers. But that isn't at its root what the story is about. It's about a man who makes the wrong decisions for the right reasons and then has to face the consequences. Movie makers have made films about bad guys doing bad things for years and yet we've found ourselves both enjoying the films and rooting at times for the bad guys (think BONNIE AND CLYE, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and possibly even Hannibal Lecter when he snacked on characters we learned to hate).My biggest fear with this series is that it will become the norm. With series like WEEDS where a recently widowed mother becomes a major marijuana dealer or DEXTER where a serial killer becomes a hero for killing bad guys and other serial killers, a trend seems to be starting. And with Hollywood being a place that loves to imitate or repeat past successes with poor quality knock offs, this could turn out to be just the first of many shows like this. Let's just hope that they know it's good and don't move forward with plans on shows about loveable hit men, goofy corrupt politicians or silly next door neighbor pedophiles."
77555,"I love Parenthood. I was disappointed when Amber's boyfriend, Ryan, rejoined the Army. However, I have read that he will return.Overall, an excellent and true-to-life picture of family life."
77556,"I don't have a lot of experience with effects stomp boxes, but enough to know when I have a winner. Behringer's TM300 is made from tough plastic. The 3 other Beheringers I have had about a year don't look warn and scarred, and sound as good as the day I got them. The tube mode pedal has an incredible flavor of tones. Fender clean, bright, British crunch and distortion, a hot  Gain and sweet smooth California sound.  I am playing out of a Peavey, but I hear a tweed. Amazing clarity, and worth the $28 and change. You won't be disappointed."
77557,"I believe this will be a big hit. I can't wait to see more of this drama and explore the eccentricities of the main character. I think the cast was chosen well for this production. This detective is a driven and bent on making sure that the case is solved no matter whose toes he steps on and all the while he is on trial himself for a supposedly &#34;bad&#34; shooting of a serial rapist. This show is based on the books by Micael Connelly and if you are a fan you want to watch this series. I give credit to Titus Welliver, who plays the detective, for making his character believable. It is well worth watching."
77558,"However the car seems to run better.  Cooler engine temps?  Not sure how.  Anyway I use this on all my gas powered stuff.  Lawnmower, pressure washer and both cars.  I put in my buddies car and he loves it.  He says better gas mileage.  However he does nothing to tune his car etc....  Would buy again."
77559,It seems to turn on at slightest motion and I think the frequent on-off cycles cause it to eat batteries.  I've gone through a 9v battery every 2-3 weeks so far using this.
77560,Fits my 6 gallon water heater in my 35ft Keystone Laredo. Looks just like the one that came with it.
77561,"Dont waste your time with Plastix, just buy this kit. All you need is this kit and a power drill. Restores old headlights to brand new condition. Well worth the money. When I wear out this kit for detailing cars I will buy another."
77562,"This film is about things that are reversed:  people look in the mirror and see the reverse image.  They look into X-rays and see a heart that's on the wrong side.  They look at their spouses and don't recognize them at all.  But it's also about things that are broken:  those same mirrors moments later, the windshields in their cars, and even broken people and relationships.It's hard to review this film in a way, because if you discuss any of the plot, it seems that you may be introducing a spoiler.  But in reality, even after watching, I'm not completely convinced that I know exactly what happened.  I will say that I considered an alternate universe idea -- with an evil doppelganger, perhaps everyone has one (physicists would argue that there are infinite universes, and in each of those, at least where ""you"" exist, ""you"" are different) -- and I did consider the old she-died-and-is-in-purgatory-but-doesn't-know-it-yet idea.  But the ending seems to at least dispel the latter.  I'm still not sure about the former.This film was filmed mostly in London, a city where I have been.  I liked ""The Tube"" scenes.  ""Mind the gap!"" is all that I could think about while watching those scenes, especially when the lead risks her life to fish a photograph off of the tracks.  At any rate, ""mind the gap!"" is surely advice that Americans should heed more often here in the States.  Especially lately.I also really liked the color palette that the director chose; mostly cool and cold blues to set the mood and tone.  And I definitely liked the fact that this was more of a psychological thriller than what Hollywood seems to like to pump out on a constant basis.  Aren't you as sick as I of all those slasher flicks?  At least this is a ""thinking man's"" -- or ""woman's"" -- film I suppose, even though I'm not convinced that all that thinking did me much good figuring out what was really going on.Maybe more of a 3.5, but I'll round up and give them an A- (or B+) for effort.  For execution?  I'll let you decide on a minor recommendation."
77563,"This hitch is a complete P.O.S.  The pin box (the 2&#34; receiver box) was welded in crooked.  It was so bad, I could tell immediately with the naked eye upon test fit.  I verified how crooked the receiver was with a level.  It was off at least a 1/4&#34;.  Absolutely no excuse for this poor workmanship...even for a Chinese-made product.  Mounting a trailer to this hitch would have been unsafe.I learned my lesson.  No more will I opt for the cheapest priced item.  Rugged Ridge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this unit to be sold with their name on it."
77564,"I have several stands, and this is the second one of these I bought. It works fine and will hold any size acoustic guitar."
77565,"Ok, this season is a mixed bag in that the first five episodes sucked. The reasons for that were iit felt like a lot of time and progression had passed since season 2 ended so it was harder to figure out where characters stood, also characters started keeping secrets from each other again which I hated and I actually ended up changing my thoughts on the Bo/Dyson/Lauren triangle.But after those episodes the season got a lot better, the secrets were finally revealed, character archs developed, new characters were introduced and they were surprisingly nice to watch, the humor returned and the end of the season was great.Ultimatly, it turned out good and if I could this would get 4.5 stars."
77566,I wish i would've bought this item before the backyard boys glass squirrel feeder because the food disappears so fast in the glass feeder that I can't keep up with feeding them.  this feeder and the squirrelog feed are keeping the squirrels busy and because they have to gnaw on the log the food doesn't disappear as fast which is a good thing for me.  they seem to love it.
77567,"Great hydraulic oil. Quality comes in an entire package. This includes the container, the pouring spout and the way the spout can be retracted with the cap on for storage. One can is enough to flush and refill the entire power steering unit.j After changing the fluid, my power steering is noticeable smoother and quieter. Very pleased with the performance of the product."
77568,"My package arrived intact and was easy to assemble:  insert hose into the container, screw cap back on, and unlock the sprayer.  When done properly no liquid and its smell gets on your hands.  This is good for those who don't want to deal with any overspill, smell or residue.It took a while for the liquid to come through the nozzle but it did spray out evenly over the surface I was using this on:  a sun-drenched dirt area of my garden popular with cats in my hood.The spray does seem to keep the cats away.  I haven't seen new poop in a while.Two complaints, though.  This stuff is expensive and it doesn't last as long as advertised.  The battery-powered sprayer seems more like a gimmick to me.  I'd prefer hand-pump action instead.I live in the high desert where dry, warm weather persists long into the year.  We don't get deer down here (they stay higher in the foothills) but we do get our share of stray dogs and cats roaming through at night.  This stuff keeps the cats away, but so do other Havahart products that sell for much less."
77569,Great filter cant beat it for the money.. Stay away from fram filters def recomment all purolator products for sure
77570,Wow what some egos in this.  New levels which I've never really seen before.  The plot line is pretty good & is fun to watch.
77571,"We will see about durability, the jury's still out. But on my truck, 2004 Silverado, they are not able to follow the curvature of the windshield so the blade does not contact the lower right hand portion of windshield. They do look good and where they contact they are OK. When these go bad I will switch back to old style because of this fault.ONE YEAR LATER: Well it turns out these don't last any longer than the usual blade. The first meaningful rain in a year and after one day they are chattering badly. The blade, when it reverses direction does not bend, instead it keeps the angle inward, so it chatters and grabs on the return stroke leaving streaks of rubber. The rubber in this blade deteriorates in sun just like any other cheapo. Damn made in China junk."
77572,"The actors are great....Love the story lines.....Boyd and Rylan , play there parts great....Very well written..,..Don't miss one of the best TV shows around....."
77573,"It is enjoyable sharing the experience of discovery with the participants in this show as they search through the items in the lockers they won by bidding.  It is amazing how often they find very valuable items abandon in storage lockers.  The participants are each in their own way interesting and enjoyable to watch but, for me, Barry is the most enjoyable and likeable character of the group.  I like it when he makes a valuable find and I feel sorry for him when he strikes out, which happens often.  If you like watching competition along with an element of mystery then I recommend this show"
77574,"cant wait for the season to start, hope they never cancel it...amazing, amazing, amazing. cant say enough good things about it. very family friendly!!!"
77575,"This wasn&#8217;t a bad movie at all.  It may not have been what I thought going in (the summary made it seem a lot darker than it really was), but overall it was a decent movie.  When Wes Bentley&#8217;s character first meets the reclusive millionaire you get the feeling that something shady is going on (i.e., he&#8217;s having him film kids playing on a jungle gym).***Spoiler***The ends up not being the case at all.  He has a very personal reason for wanting Bentley&#8217;s character to go out and film various locations (one I won&#8217;t spoil for potential viewers).  The movie has a relatively good ending and message about what&#8217;s really important in life.  If you are a fan of artistic movies or just art in general you may really this movie.  I found it very interesting myself.  Some of the art displayed in this movie was extremely impressive.  It&#8217;s worth checking out.T.S.

77576,Nothing like worm poo to help fertilize the garden.  Worm poo is supposed to be spread at a rate of 1lb of poo for every 10 square feet.  So be mindful of how/where you need to use this stuff.  I purchase it for my raised garden beds.  It is one of the things that I use to refresh the garden at the beginning of the season.
77577,"Husky Floor Liners front and rear for a 2013 F350 Crew cab.  Good heavy duty material, perfect fit, looks like if called upon to capture water, mud or just dirt build up off of boots there are more than capable of doing so.  I purchased these used from the Amazon Warehouse and saved a pretty good amount of money.  They looked like they had never been out of the box."
77578,This is another winner from  Fiskars. It is well made and comfortable to use. I do a lot of tinkering with the plants in my raised garden bed and this is one of the tools that makes my tasks much easier. It is a perfect size for my needs and when I need to move some soil around this scoop comes to the rescue. Very fine tool.
77579,"I had gotten some new mulch spread around the house and flower beds.  I wanted something to kill the ants if any came travelling in the mulch.  This product was easy to spread, you just sprinkle and go.  However, within a day we had ants everywhere.  I don't even know if the mulch had ants in it but after using this product I had ants coming and going.  They were in the house, on the countertops, going back and forth across the deck.  They were under the bathroom sink for goodness sake, in and out of the dogfood bowl, up and down the walls.  I can't say enough but we had ants everywhere.  So I guess if they product works depends upon your definition of effective? Did it get rid of the ants from the mulch? Yep! But it didn't kill them they just went berserk. It has cost me a fortune for using this product because now I've got borax and chemicals all over my pantry and countertops to actually kill the ants that are now all inside my house.  I think it ran in ants that were quite content living in the ground OUTSIDE my house. Be forewarned."
77580,To many back flashes to suit me. The story line is very good but just get on with the show.
77581,"This movie requires patience, but if you don't have it just fast forward till it looks interesting.  This is a decent thriller, but not overly thrilling.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I watched it but I found myself fast forwarding which I don't do very often.  I think perhaps this movie needed better editing, there was to much footage of mountain scenery, parade, et cetera.  Had they trimmed there and developed the characters more it would have been better.  It doesn't take all that much to figure out what is going on, and they dragged us with all the extra footage.  There are some great scenes of them escaping the bad guys, but they needed a bad guy boss on the scene with some character.  The bad guys are okay but nothing made me think, oh those guys really scare me (see John Lithgow's great performance in Cliffhanger).  In fact I think they were made to look so cold blooded I just didn't care about them at all.  The five people on the mountain are decent, but only a couple I halfway felt I knew a little by the end.  The police that try to help are barely developed so once again they are okay.  They needed more screen time because I started to like the black cop, but didn't get time to really know him.  The girls father at the end was more interesting because you could feel his intensity.  All-in-all a pretty decent movie but it had a lot more potential had they developed more of the characters and spent less time on the surroundings. I love scenery and sets, but they don't make the movie, the actors and story do.  At this less than seven dollar price it is worth buying.Recommendations:Shoot to Kill,Cliffhanger, andThe Eiger SanctionCA Luster"
77582,"This product works extremely well and is extremely reliable. Anyone complaining about the short cord didn't do their homework. The pictures clearly illustrate a short cord. A 12 foot cord would be ridiculous on a car mountable charger. I like to use those 9 inch lighted extension cords sold atwalmart and Amazon.com, These give you a lighted indication of power when plugged in. My charger is under hood mounted and has seen over 110 degreeswhile running highway speeds and charging in summer heat. Frankly I'm amazed it still works 5 years later. I will buy another if it quits working."
77583,"I continue to be intrigued by both the main storyline and the very human back stories. Although the acting could be better all around, the storyline and all its twists and turns keep me engaged and eager for future episodes."
77584,"My grand daughter absolutely loves Duck Dynasty and so we are watching it for about the 20th time, but it is a good show with good values and she could be watching some real junk, Duck Dynasty is good values show with people who though a little crazy represent all the is good in America today.  I do wish Amazon would carry more G, PG and PG-13 movies and TV programing it is hard to find good TV, its either murders or sex or both and bad language abounds even in the PG-13 so we end up watching a lot of Clean House, we've watched all of a lot of the series and find it hard to find new ones that we enjoy because they are so limited.  We do not and will not watch R rated and will shut off smutty PG-13.  So when we reach our limit on what Amazon offers we will leave it for another channel.  There must be someone who respects the adult viewer who doesn't care for R or close to  it TV"
77585,"The point of this series escapes me. All the characters live in a moral cesspool of broken promises and self-delusions. It's anthemic puppetry at its worst, with a cast of low characters who hold onto codes unfit for a colony of rats scurrying about on a sinking ship. Any tether to &#34;Hamlet&#34; is castrated by respective beliefs systems that are impossible to fathom. The only character that emerges with a wit of self-awareness is Jax's former girlfriend. I must be mental for watching the first five seasons to arrive upon this conclusion."
77586,These strings are performance value and always give me a great sound.  I have been using Elixir's for 5 years now and they last longer (even in this salty air environment by the beach) and sound better than anything else I have ever used.
77587,"Amazon recently ran this for $36.70, including super saver shipping.  I had looked extensively in brick and mortar stores, and this umbrella for that price cannot be purchased in those places.  The cost will be more like double at best.  The umbrella opens and closes easily, which I appreciate.  The metal construction is definitely welcome; my last one was wood and warped in one season.  The thing I like best is that it looks so much more expensive, and it is very sturdy as well.  I will update this review later as to how the umbrella frame and fabric withstand the extremely hot weather we get from July through October.  I bought the green one, and the color is dark, and just what I wanted."
77588,"This is a quality feeder at a reasonable price and it's good looking too.  If a feeder is hard to clean, human nature being what it is, it will be cleaned less often, and this results in an unhealthy as well as unsightly situation.  With this in mind, the best designed feeders are those like the Perky-Pet 8117-2:  a bottle that threads into a base containing the feeding ports.  The Perky-Pet base is in two halves that come apart when the bottle is unscrewed, making cleaning simple.  Unlike every other feeder I've had, the Perky-Pet base is made of metal, even the flower shaped feeding ports are metal; hopefully it will be long lasting.  The antique style blue glass bottle is as attractive in use as it is in the Amazon photos.  The 16 ounce capacity is, for me, the ideal size; the 8 ounce feeders need filling too often, the larger feeders produce a lot of wasted sugar water if filled to capacity.The metal hanger on the 8117-2 has a small loop that doesn't quite allow it to fit on my feeder poles and makes hanging it clumsy, so a separate S-shaped hanger would seem to be a necessary accessory.  For my purposes the 8117-2 is incomplete as is, so only 4 stars.Hummingbirds can perch on the edge of the base while feeding.  Any hummingbird feeder should be located out of direct sunlight to keep the sugar water from evaporating and turning bad; I'd think that the metal perch on this unit makes it all the more necessary to keep it from getting too much direct sun in the summer.  This is my only reservation about this feeder."
77589,I really liked the series and the cast and the story line and like so many other reviewers I am disappointed that there is no second season.  I wish another network would continue with it.
77590,Great Mini-series. Missed it this summer but now I can get it all here. Thanks Amazon Prime! If you have not seen it yet I highly recommend it.
77591,"I know its a show but the graphics are sub par and the story line is boring.  For some reason, I don't like the main male character in this show.  Sadly, I only watched one episode so I may be judging too early.  The game on the other hand is great!  First true MMORPG for a first person shooter.  I give it props!"
77592,"Bought this pick looking for options around the old ""dropped pick"" syndrome. I was skeptical, as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most. However, once between thumb and index finger, these darlings hang on!"
77593,"After the slow start  of season one , as in comparison to the first uk version. This show got better and found it's own way. By now these are well established charactors and the show hums along very well each episode.  This season is doing a fine job as you would expect.  Even by the end of season one , it was obvious that this was going it's own way and was getting down to making this world a complete one.  This season is as strong as the last so far. And that's a good thing.  The uk version ended last year and it was always more edgy for certain but this one is more about the 'human's' in the storyline.  I will miss the other show , but at least this one will be around for at least a few more seasons or more.  And it deserves to be."
77594,I like the spikes. It makes keeping my plants in good shape so much easier than mixing a fluid mix. Just pop it in and you're good to go!
77595,Ya this movie started off ok but then slowly declined into a crappy horror movie with some music thrown in. Pretty much the same songs are  just used over and over again throughout the movie and are not clever at all. Acting is ok but nothing special. The killer was kinda cool but even that annoying after awhile. I wouldn't recommend this at all.
77596,My husband and I started watching Survivor as a fluke because it was on Amazon Prime.  We have bought all of the seasons available and are looking for more Amazon!!
77597,"I'm not sure what is so appealing about mealworms, but whatever it is, it's making my chicken who love me, love me even more, and making the chickens who are scared senseless of me think that I am the best thing in their world...EVER!  This stuff should be named ""better than sex cake"" for chickens!  It's that crazy - all my chickens love this stuff, the dog loves this stuff, and heck - if I would let my kids eat it, I bet they'd love it too (bugs are cool to a 4 year old apparently...no, I did not let them eat it).  The price on Amazon is also over HALF the price in any pet store.  I just bought a bag today at a pet store because I didn't want to suffer the wrath of 12 little beady eyed terrors because they didn't get their hit today, and I paid $12 for a 7 ounce bag.  Argh!  Definitely going to order some more right now...gotta make sure I've got happy chickens to get happy eggs!  According to my hens - HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended!"
77598,These are laser cut pads for your studio monitors. I feel more vibration from a hard drive spinning on my desktop than the sounds coming out of my speakers. And they look professional too.
77599,"I have to admit, I was disappointed upon opening my package. The chain had become loose in transit and from there it was downhill. We were able to get it attached again, but I never got over that initial disappointment. My initial reaction was, &#34;oh, flimsy plastic&#34;.  I didn't want to even waste the time or money to buy an additional jar of jelly, so I used what we had in the house. I haven't seen a bird go near it yet, but it has held up.  I am giving the Perky-Pet Oriole Jelly Wild Bird Feeder a neutral review because it does what it says it does, but I am not a fan."
77600,"I was really getting into this one (about half through the season) when I found out it had been cancelled. How frustrating! It was still entertaining and worth the watch, but man I wish they would quit cancelling shows left and right."
77601,"This ice scraper is very well designed. It is sturdy enough to chisel through ice, and brush away large amounts of snow. A lot of ice scrapers have chisels and brushes at opposite ends of the handle, which makes using the chisel cumbersome (since you have to hold the device by the brush). However, the Hopkins Ice Hammer placed both the chisel and brush at the same end of the device. Overall, I am very satisfied."
77602,"So, I have both a Battery Tender Plus and a Junior.  They're great devices; I've brought batteries seemingly back from the dead with them when some other chargers I had could not.  However, there are two points worth making:The Junior and Plus have the same logic; they only differ in the maximum charging current.  Basically, the Plus will charge a battery up faster.  If you're only using them for storage or you're not in a hurry, save nearly $20 and get the Junior.  But I expect that you'll be happy with either one.The one complaint I have is with the Warranty.  My Plus stopped working recently.  I'm not sure why; perhaps a power surge or something; it's not like I've ever dropped or abused it.  In any event, since they have a 10 year warranty, I called Deltran up.  I can send the unit in (which will cost me $8+ for shipping with some kind of tracking so I can verify that it arrived) and then they charge $17 and change for a ""warranty diagnosic"" and return shipping.  So, it basically costs around $25 to get my $40 device serviced under warranty.  It's not a completely unreasonable sum, but if Deltran really had faith in their products, they could easily eat that cost - I think I should at least not have to pay for a diagnostic fee on something under warranty which I've already proven to not work in multiple outlets and on multiple batteries. I think I'll just pay the extra $15 to get a brand new one, and use this as a paper weight.But anyway, the products work really well.  My advice is just to buy this assuming there's really no warranty; as long as that's your expectation, you won't be disappointed."
77603,"I hated Mark Harmen for years.  I saw him in 2 roles where he was a really bad dude, and so convincing I decided he must be a bad dude for realz.  When NCIS came along I said &#34;I'm not watching that A hole&#34;.  The everyone kept telling me how much fun it was and how I was missing it.  I got the first couple seasons on sale and decided to give it a shot.  All is forgiven Mark.  The show is smart, funny and fresh every time.  they do not go too far on gore or violence and they always look good, even in a prison camp which is not easy.  You can start with any season and still enjoy but I suggest begining at the begining."
77604,"When I saw this series twenty years ago, I was very affected by the way the families and royalty of Rome must have lived. It is shocking to see the evil that flourished in the Roman Empire at the time.Rome may have been the Cradle of Civilization, but it was also the cauldron where the seven deadly sins could nurture and grow and repeat generation after generation. Serial killers seem to have abounded there, and if that didn't affect you maybe the lead in the drinking vessels did! (That was not mentioned for obvious reasons). Livia really scared me; Claudius was a real survivor and by the end, I was not surprised of his entire life being one of abuse from others (with a few exceptions that I was glad for). What can I say about Caligula that hasn't already been said? He is so thoroughly evil and misguided and insane.They say this miniseries is the most watched of all time and I can believe it. It is a fascinating study of the darkest parts of humankind. It is very well acted and well written. I can't help but give it 5 stars! Thank you!"
77605,"I simply do not understand all these rave reviews. This was probably the pilot I was most interested in, as I'm a fan of both Coppola and Schwartzman (as well as many of the actors), and love classical music.But this not good. Shades of Smash (in tone) - schmaltzy, not funny, cliched. I don't feel any evidence of the pedigree here. I did enjoy / laugh at the Styx musical, but found the rest dull (endless game of spin the bottle) or groan-worthy (musicians have sex like they play instruments!)"
77606,"Where I live, it seems there are more deer around than birds in the sky. We live in very northern Minnesota and are about an hour outside of the areas largest city. In a tiny tourist town that's surrounded by national forests, we live where people come to camp on the weekends. So to say we have a lot of deer and other wildlife locally would be an understatement. The deer walk in herds comfortably through town all day every day. While most people driving through a neighborhood might have to worry about someones pet dog running out into the street, here you can hardly drive to the local post-office without having to dodge groups of white tails.One of the reasons the deer come into town is because of the easy access to food. Everyone has bird feeders, gardens, and some even buy cracked corn and place it outside in the evenings just for feeding the deer specifically. So at any time of day, locals can look outside and usually see the large pests chowing down on just about anything found in their front yard. The deer here are not easily scared. Barking dogs, cars going by and people walking aren't a bother to them at all. A few years back, I opened my front door to let my 3 dogs outside to go to the bathroom, and found a huge deer had walked up onto my porch and was eating the flowers out of my potted plants. In the process of opening the storm door, I bumped it right in the rear, not knowing it was there. It just turned and looked at me, annoyed that I had interpreted it's meal.However one thing the deer definitely don't like is being squirted by water. They walk past the yards that have running sprinklers, and of my neighbors have motion detecting systems installed, so that when a large animal comes into their yard, a sprinkler system goes off. However I''m not looking to spend that kind of money to install such a large setup, just to keep the deer from eating my potted plants. Also I have 3 large dogs, and I don't need something going off every time I need to let them outside. I need something extremely simple. Something that doesn't require being hooked up to my hose all the time. And I wanted something that didn't need power cables run to it. This Havahart Spray Away is just that.This system is exactly what I needed. I am able to put the Spray Away unit right in front of my porch, where my potted plants sit. I love that it's mobile, not affixed to the ground and no need to have any power cables or hoses hooked up to it. If I decide to move my plants to get better sunlight, I can move this unit right with them. The solar panel provides all the power it needs, and inside of it there is a water reservoir for filling so there's no need to keep the hose hooked up to it. You don't even need to hook up the hose to it to fill it. This is a big plus, since I need my hose for so many other things in the summertime.You can change the sensitivity levels, so that it's not going off every time a bird goes by. Or if you're trying to keep birds like crows or seagulls away, you can set it super sensitive so that it goes off when they get within a certain range. There are two light indicators on the side that will flash to let you know if your water in the reservoir is getting low, or if the solar battery is running low. It does need a few days of sitting in the sunshine before the first use so it can get a full charge. Also if the battery completely runs out (days of raining/cloudy weather) it will need some time to charge up again. This does run on sunlight, so it if sits all day in the shade, it will run on the stored solar energy and then need recharged before using it again. If you use this in direct sunlight, recharging time won't be a problem, because it will be able to keep drawing on the solar energy each day.This is the perfect solution for keeping deer away from plants, stray dogs out of your lawn or just about anything else you want to keep away from something. With the adjustable sensor, you can set it to the size of animal you want, and the distance away that it is before the unit spays them. It can be set to keep something out of your yard, but not squirt people as they are waling by on the sidewalk. With the great portability it has (no power cords or hoses), the low-cost when compared to built in deterrent system, and the range of settings it offers, this Havahart Spray Away is just what I was looking for. Love it!"
77607,They are well built and can hold almost any speaker system you throw at them. I have already recommended these to a friend and he bought them. He likes them too.
77608,i live in a haunted house and these stories are very similar to what I experience on a daily basis.
77609,"These filters are a great buy at this price point, and really improve the taste and odor of most campground water supplies."
77610,This pedal is a must have for any pedal board. I love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray. Thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best.
77611,"I put this around the perimeter of our home, per the instructions, and so far so good - no bugs close to the house (but then before the application, I didn't have any either).I DO have some active ant hills in the yard (in the grass), and I put this generously on those, and waited a week.  Today I checked, and some of the ants are still there, active and happy.  I'm NOT.  I'd rather use a liquid that I can pour on these ant hills and kill all those nasty bugs, as that seams to work better than dry granules, bait, or whatever this is all suppose to be.  I won't be purchasing more of this."
77612,"It does work. It is a bit flimsy, but one shouldn't be scrubbing hardwhile washing your vehicle. If care is taken, it should last. Microfiberhead is not very plush like my Griot's mitt, but I use it to do the hard to reach areas of my SUVonly, then switch to mitts."
77613,A great price for a great product. I have used meguiar's products for years with great results.  Highly recommended for car lovers.
77614,"Great wiper blades,not just for snow and ice work great for mud on the jeep.I run them all year around."
77615,"A rich heiress ( Gemma Atherton) is kidnapped by two ex-convicts and a ransom demand of 2 million pounds is made. Most of the plot, if revealed, will lead you think' Haven't I seen this movie' but leave these assumptions aside as this movie is a twister with turns happening at every interval and the balance of power shifting between the kidnapper and the kidnapped. This is a very difficult movie to review because writing about the plot would give a lot away. Still, it is a treat to watch. Three stars. 2/3/11"
77616,"Guitar pics, what more can I say.  Nice feel and look.  Never can have enough because they seem to be prone to theft! :)"
77617,Fits Curt 13534 great.  Looks good.  Has a built in holder to avoid loosing it.  Easy installation.  I am very satisfied.
77618,This thing is a waste of money for your 30&#34; Masterbuilt smoker.  It is of cheap material.  Easily blows off if you live in a windy area (like I do) and will certainly degrade quickly in the elements.  If I had to do it over I wouldn't waste my $ on this.  If it was half the price I would buy several but for what they are charging you are better off coming up with a cover solution of your own.
77619,"For some reason the first episode was released early, but for those watching now or watching on the 15th, the show has great potential. Its not perfect, and the first episode has its slow parts, but overall it was enjoyable to watch, especially as you get to the battle near the end. This is the first time a game and tv showed have been tied together like this, and as a player of the game I really want to see Defiance end up successful for everyone involved. We need more companies, and people, willing to try new things and I hope future episodes continue to improve as the story expands and the cast gets used to working together. The cast itself is pretty solid overall with a few well known names involved. Jaime Murray (Spartacus/Warehouse 13) and Julie Benz (Buffy) being two of my favorites. Farscape fans will also notice one of the people behind Defiance is the creator of Farscape, Rockne S. O'Bannon. We need more good sci-fi shows out there and so far Defiance looks like it could be the next one to watch."
77620,I really couldn't see this as the basis for a television series.  I was wrong.  It's visually beautiful and very well done.
77621,"so bizarre, each of the room mates is so strange in their own way but it is all laugh out loudable"
77622,"got it quick, works great love it ,easy to read nice and small easy to carry and easy to store."
77623,The characters are unique and their relationship s add greatly to the plot. I THOROUGHLY ENJOY. I wish there were more episodes.
77624,"Its sweet endearing and funny. Mindys brand of adora-quirk is even better now than on The Office, where I loved her character.  Theres a cute token British guy, and Chris Messina is super hot in this show as Danny."
77625,This show rocks!I agree with the majority this is a great sci-fi show and I look forward to the next episode to see what is really going on with Dr. Woods character. Extant is really a great show and every moment there is an interesting plot going on. It's certainly worth the time to see and glad to see Halle on television.
77626,"In television the key to a long running series is the interplay of the characters on the screen more than the actual story line.  In the book series King and Maxwell play well off each other, can the TV writers continue that, that will be the key to the future of this TV shows.It doesn't matter that they butchered the story &#34;The Sixth man&#34; for the pilot show, it gave them some characters that they will need to make this a truly interesting series.  It also doesn't matter that the Series Sean King is only 6 ft, not 6 ft 3 like in the book.  And Ms. Maxwell is running around in high heals.  I don't know what it is about Hollywood that they think all women run around in stiletto and can run and jump and kick ass in them.  If you have the chance to view any woman in Michael line of work, the the last thing they wear is a stiletto.  Don't get me wrong, I love to see a woman in 6 in stilettos, I don't know how they walk, I just enjoy it.That being aside, the show is working hard to create that interplay between the two stars to make it work.  What makes the shows like NCIS, Law a& Order, Bones and all the great shows stand the test of time is that interplay.  Being a fan of Baldacci and his work, I would like to see it last, but not if it will denigrate his work.  I've watched 6 shows, and it shows promise.  Now if the writers can continue with quality scripts, but the most important thing, is the King & Maxwell relationship."
77627,"This has a nice simple clean and sweet smell to it. It does not smell like old dollar bills, cigarettes and stale beer."
77628,Was hoping this product would help deter our outdoor cat from going places i do not want it to belike our back deck and using it as a scratching postwell i sprayed it on the trees and shrubsgave the deck a good sprayingeven sprayed the place the cat likes to sleepi am trying to get it to hang out a little farther awaynot much luckhe slept in the same spot the next nightsure as i was spraying it he would stay clearbut hours later he was right back in the spot i had sprayedso i guess back to the citrus and vinegar sprays i have been using
77629,"I watched this show when it first came out on H.B.O. and I really liked it. If you like shows about Romans and such, give this show a try. The show follows two family's. One rich and one poor. You really get hooked trying to figure out what will happen to these two family's."
77630,"Note: I have seen every episode of this show in HD via XFinity On Demand.WARNING: CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!!!After a fantastic debut season, minus the disgusting and unneccessary gay romances, could SMASH maintain the momentum and story for season II? Well, it's no fault of the actors and writers. They certainly tried their hardest, and for the most part, it worked very well. The episodes were finely structured, and the characters more than two-dimensioned. Some traits, however, came completely out of left field and were entirely unneccessary, both from a creative and dramatic standpoint. Example: It was so never hinted at that Kyle was gay until he's seen kissing a guy in a bar, who shortly thereafter breaks up with him because he sodomised another man, and the scenes of guys kissing each other, and being in bed next to each other were totally unneccessary, as they added NOTHING to the plot, and above all, they're immoral, both socially, and Biblically. The Bible saith, ""Thou shalt not lie with a man as one lieth with a woman; it is abomination."" The show could have succeeded without that garbage in it. However, that is the only fly in the ointment of what was otherwise a spectacular television series. Kyle was a sympathetic character, and I think he & Karen would have been a perfect couple, had things not worked out with Derek & Karen.I was very disappointed with how the show ended things, in terms of relationships. Karen & Derek should have ended up together, Jimmy should have died, along with Sam (good idea to excise him for a number of episodes; shame that it wasn't permanent, though). Tom also should have gotten a girlfriend, and stayed with her. The drama with Daisy should have been explored more (I would loved to have seen the coup the dancers did against her, and the confrontation between her and Jerry when Derek tells her that there's been a change of plan. Season I had a lot of great songs. Season II, though, not so much. The quality of the storylines were still strong, minus the gay b.s., but the overall quality of good songs just seemed to drop drastically, though there were some good ones. So, in regard to the male/male gay stuff aspect of the show, SAYONARA, PIGS!!! Good luck finding another mudhole. Katharine McPhee, Jack Davenport, Debra Messing and Anjelica Huston were really good in this show, and Ms. McPhee has a big future ahead of her.Rated TV-14 (gay people kissing & in bed, moderate profanity)."
77631,"I'm primarily a guitar player, but I do have a decent mandolin that had factory strings on it.  Those strings made it hard to play, so I tried these D'Addario mandolin strings.  What a difference!  These strings are great!"
77632,Perfect fit for my 3 series BMW.  Looks exactly like the OEM blads/arms that came with the car.  Clears the window great.
77633,"Ordered these to go along with my new Race Ramps.  I wanted to stay with a rubber product for use on the ground and especially on the Race Ramps because I didn't want to risk damage to the ramps.  Really nice and heavy, does what it claims, prevents wheels from moving accidentally.I also have a pair of metal wheel chocks that are made in the USA and while I still use those, these have become my favorite, the metal ones have shown their age with rust around the chocks.The only negative that I can post about is the cost.  Ideally, it should be much less than what Race Ramps charges for the chocks.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
77634,"I gave this unit a 3 star not because the scanner is bad . its not thi unit works great . finally a unit that works and at a great price.However there is a problem with the Scan Tool CD sent with unit . Its a 2006 dated CD .The info on it is outdated and not even understood by BAFX representatives. Spent alot of wasted time trying to get BAFX to answer questions regarding Scan Tool. Gave up  and after  researching  Scan Tool  contacted  Palmer Peformance  Engineering who informed me that BAFX was not authorized to supply this CD and had been asked not tosupply it.Rather than get confused with Scan Tool CD contact PPE.I ended up using  Touch Scan with the Elm 327.PRO's  Definitely puchase ELM 327 from BAFXCONS  Thow out the CD and contact directly an appropriate software provider { Not Torque , who offers little to zero support}In addition Touch Scan has 14 day free trial  offer."
77635,The writing was bad. The acting was bad. How can you ruin a bloodsucker show ? Watch it if you like but I would save my money if I where you.
77636,the first thing that happened was that the two end caps fell off. where? i don't know. but i hope to find them. i really think this is a 1 inch capacity lopper. in my experience there is no way this can cut 2 inches of wood. what kind of wood can it cut 2 inches of? yes it is a great tool but for 1 inch branches or less. i am happy that i bought it but it is for light duty and it does a great job of light duty work. i have been outside clearing a lot of branches and brush and i cannot ever see this cutting 2 inches of anything.
77637,"I love this wall hanging mount. Of course, you should use longer screws than what they give you and you should make sure to mount it in a stud, or use drywall backing screws, etc, but that's just common sense.The actual product works perfectly and exactly as described. The arms are adjustable & stay where you put them. This fits my 5string Fender Jazz Bass as well as my acoustic guitar & violin (and even holds the neck without touching the pegs, if you want it to). I will be buying more of these for my other stringed instruments.This is a very well designed product that works just like you want it to."
77638,I think it's boring but the Mr. likes it.  Not much changes from episode to episode.  It must be a guy thing.
77639,Good quality and fits.
77640,This is by far the best brake controller I have ever used in 30 years of towing. Has a wide range of tow setting to accommodate different trailer weights. I wouldn't use anything else!
77641,Great show love the characters and the action and the love story part of it it's different from all the other vampire love story's
77642,"This season of Supernatural was fairly different from the others. While still carrying an episodic feel there was enough of all elements/characters recurring that it wasn't exactly the same as the first two. This season also started to mix in more light hearted hurmorous episodes among the darker and intense ones, which I didn't mind as I had grown to really like what humor had previously been shown.As for the additions of the female anti heroes, I actually grew to enjoy their presence on the show. Yes, they made the Winchesters look childish but that's actually how they have behaved previously, just no one called them out on it. Also it was pretty interesting to have demons be given more personality and learn that not all of them are completly evil and have motives.Despite that, I did find some flaws within the season. Sam and Deans arguments got even more repetitive, a couple characters from season 2 were written out of this season and the demon army didn't get mentioned that much, which was surprising as I thought total choas would've erupted from the release of those demons.All in all, the show took some new steps that I liked and keeps it going."
77643,"Doesn't take much per bucket, so this will last me quite a while, especially with my tiny smart car.Does a good job cleaning, as others have said, little residue so it rinses well and with a chamois dry, leaves the finish looking very good.And doesn't ""funk up"" your washing mitt and other washing accessories as some other products I've used in the past did."
77644,"In spite of the low cost, the design of this unit's circuitry is fairly robust -- better than some DIY designs you will find on the web.FTDI usb to serial interface IC (FT232BL), and LM393 dual voltage comparator for dual K line level conversion (only). (OK)The main drawback is that the supplied software is useless (ancient), and the instructions are useless (non-applicable to any recent versions of windows). It is also understood that there is no support.Initially installing the USB driver from FTDI web site seemed to work, but did not. Strongly consider using the latest drivers from windows update site, which work properly with VCDS lite and (of course) are signed and work well with Windows 7 (in my base 64 bit version also).Also when checking connection using VCDS lite, ""options"" (per instructions), make sure you do this _physically_ _connected_ to car's OBD port, and _not_ with other serial ports (which will falsely pass ""test"" in VCDS lite ""options"" pane). These are the two most common setup/install problems you may encounter.There is no support for this product or the software you might run with it, so take care to follow the directions precisely. If you do so, you will have a good chance of this working with recent versions of windows and vcds-lite (or other free/share ware for VW/Audi OBD).Where my sample fell short is in proper function; tested this with multiple computers and known-compatible cars (that work with other OBD-II readers); it did not ever establish a connection to the car. Software used included the VCDS freeware version, as well as two other open source tools.When checking the connections and soldering under microscope, I found that the OBD connector (J1962) that connects to the car jack was poorly soldered. Otherwise the device appears well put together.Amazon processed a refund properly; boost review a star given huge value and good fallback if all else fails.BTW purchased the similar, but better-built cable, from ecstuning for about 3x the total cost. Very happy with that bit of hardware."
77645,"Hi all. I used this to connect the Midwoofer to the crossover module in my Infinity Components. And used a wiring adapter to connect the Factory Harness to the Input. Now I when I need to, It will be easier to remove my front door panels. As I only have two plugs to remove for the speakers."
77646,This series is not for the faint of heart. It is very intense and unpredictable. You can't wait for the next episode.
77647,"Throughout its phenomenal 1994-2004 run on NBC, FRIENDS demonstrated that familiarity doesn't always breed contempt, but isn't it nice that even after 10 years, we could still learn something new about these intimately observed characters?Tidbits revealed in the episode &#34;The One Where the Stripper Cries&#34;: Ross (David Schwimmer) and Monica (Courtney Cox) used to entertain at family gatherings as Donny and Marie; (&#34;Oh God, that's right,&#34; remembers Rachel. &#34;I blocked that out.&#34;) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) kissed Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) at a college party in the 1980s. The best was saved for &#34;The Last One&#34;: At one time, Ross (David Schwimmer) pursued being a professional dancer (&#34;Do you realize we almost made it 10 years without that coming up?,&#34; he remarks).This 2003-04 Season is all about life changes and closure. Monica and Chandler buy a house and make plans to adopt a baby. Once New Age free spirit Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) gets married. Rachel is offered a job in Paris, prompting Ross to finally proclaim his love. Two of Friends's most invaluable players are granted worthy send-offs.Janice (Maggie Wheeler) resurfaces as a prospective homebuyer in the house next door to Monica and Chandler in &#34;The One Where Estelle Dies,&#34; and Central Perk fixture Gunther (James Michael Tyler) at last professes his adoration of Rachel in &#34;The Last One.&#34;MARRIED WITH CHILDREN's Christina Applegate makes a welcome return in &#34;The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits&#34; and Danny DeVito is the unlikely and very temperamental stripper in &#34;The One Where the Stripper Cries.&#34;Greg Kinnear is at his smarmy best as Ross's new girlfriend's Nobel-prize-winning ex-boyfriend in &#34;The One with Ross' Grant.&#34; Dakota Fanning has a sweet scene with Joey (Matt LeBlanc) in &#34;The One with Princess Consuela&#34; and Anna Faris joins Paul Rudd (Phoebe's husband Mike, a.k.a. Crap Bag in &#34;Princess Consuela&#34;) as a recurring cast member in &#34;The One with the Birth Mother.&#34;FRIENDS 10th and final season quickly recovers from the Joey-Rachel misstep to find its consistent and satisfying groove. As each Friend turns in their key to the apartment each had shared at one time or another over the past 10 years in &#34;The Last One,&#34; could Friends end on a happier or more poignant note?This final addition to the FRIENDS DVD library, too, rises to the momentous occasion with a more generous package of features, including a lengthy gag reel and reflections from the ensemble.The worldwide smash-hit comedy returns for a 10th Season! For a hilarious look at dating and working in the big city, delve into the hearts and minds of 6 friends living in New York City as they explore the anxieties and absurdities of adulthood.During this exciting time when everything seems possible, even marriage, parenthood and career moves, they know they will always face the future together--because they've got Friends.This 2003-2004 Season of FRIENDS also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 31 going on 32 years old when I was engaged to be married to my wife and when we had all those fiscal budget cuts going on back then from the recession we had in 2003-2004 when George Bush, Jr. was our president."
77648,Keeps all the grit out of my water.makes car detailing so much easier.I may just buy another one!
77649,"Light weight, hose seems thin but these things never last very long anyway. I think it will be fine if I am careful not to drag it across the ground."
77650,"This is entertaining and I've enjoyed watching it. I hope there is a second season. This is brief because I'm not really prepared to write a review, but I wanted to give it the 4 stars."
77651,Does a wonderful job removing polish and wax - the material makes it effortless.  It's very absorbent and plush.  I would recommend and purchase again.
77652,"You either want to carry something on your key chain that will save your life, or you don't. Pretty much common sense purchase. It works."
77653,"I have to give props to the designers at FUEGO, the element manages to be incredibly functional while maintaining a very small footprint. It is a breeze to move around and there is plenty of room on the outside cooking zone (the grill has two zones with differing heat characteristics). I grilled 8 burgers and 6 bratwurst simultaneously using both zones. Assembly was quick and painless (&#60; 30min) thanks to very well thought out packaging. It felt like opening an iPhone; there was nearly no wasted space and you only had to unpack parts as they were needed. My only qualm with the assembly was that the quick instructions didn't account for a couple of included parts. They were however referenced in the manual, although in the parts list one part was called the ignition stick but in the instructions it was referred to as the lighting stick (just kind of weird considering how much attention to detail everything else was given). One thing to note is that in order to get the grill to temperature you MUST have the cover on. Even with the cover on, cooking took a bit longer than I was used to. Overall this is a sexy, sturdy, functional grill."
77654,"When I was looking for a nice storage box for my front porch -- I ordered this product based on the other reviews.  They were right!  It WAS easy to put together.  Less than 2 minutes, no tools, no kidding.  It's very sturdy and doubles as overflow seating when necessary.  Very handy.  I even went back and ordered the larger one.  One note on the color:  It's more of a light taupe than the whiteish tone you see in the picture.  No matter. I highly recommend it."
77655,"This item was purchased because my landscape trailer was constantly pulling my harnesses apart, they would drag the street all the time. This is a simple bracket you install on your hitch or bumper that keeps the light harness stationary. I will never again go without this bracket. matter of fact I plan to order a few more so I have them when I upgrade or buy more trucks for my company. I highly recommend this product if you pull any kind of trailer."
77656,"I liked the first two seasons, which I started watching because I have been attracted to Dana Delaney ever since &#34;China Beach&#34;. The incredibly beautiful and talented Jeri Ryan's appearance as Kate Murphy was another plus because, as 7 of 9, she almost single-handedly rescued &#34;Star Trek: Voyager&#34; from mediocrity, but in the third season Delaney's Megan Hunt has somehow morphed into a much more poisonous and disagreeable character than she was before, making her less easy to like or care about. Ryan/Kate's totally out-of-character (and somehow ridiculous) one night stand - much too gratuitously and graphically filmed - with the mysterious Ukrainian assassin/rescuing hero Sergei (Ivan Sergei) is jarring, but then I'm not one of those who enjoys being made into a bedroom, peeping-tom voyeur. I suppose such scenes are thrown in to pump up the ratings because that's what the viewing public wants, but they have the opposite effect on me, and it disappoints me that otherwise great actors are willing to participate in them - on sets full of film crew personnel. Such scenes aren't exciting - they're numbing and desensitizing and promote casual, meaningless sex as if they were advertising Happy Meals. With nothing left to the imagination, no imagination is any longer required - and all this stuff is available on prime time TV. Hard to believe the world was once shocked when Rhett Butler said to Scarlett O'Hara in &#34;Gone With The Wind&#34;, &#34;Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn&#34;. Of course that was 1939, but I can't honestly describe what we're routinely seeing more and more of today as &#34;progress&#34;. Windell Middlebrooks as Curtis is - I hate to say it - an almost stereotypical joke that comes close to being racist by making him seem too much like Lincoln Perry's character portrayal of the bumbling and stupid Stepin Fetchit from the 1930's. Geoffrey Arend as Ethan Gross is, to put it as kindly as possible, a witless, obnoxious jerk of very low intellectual candle power. The scripts are, for the most part, quite good and entertaining. The characters - like Megan's usually exasperating mother (Joanna Cassidy) - are, however, occasionally and sometimes always a bit problematic."
77657,"Well done version of Little Dorrit. Enjoyable watch, a little twist on the tricky relationship between Clennams and Amy Dorrit."
77658,"Someone described this before as the X files meets Twin Peaks, and they weren't wrong. But I think it may be even slightly better, as if those two shows weren't already wonderful.This is fresh and lightly done weirdness, with a picturesque town that seems almost normal, and yet just isn't quite. Full of characters, excellent twists on the mutant powers seen in X men and so many other works of fantasy, but described as troubles rather then gifts, mainly because whatever the new guy has got as his or her talent, just isn't under his control. And half the mystery of each show is simply trying to work out what power is at work and who has it, because they don't make it obvious early on.Best of all though, the ending. I won't give away any spoilers, but the twists were unexpected, not telegraphed in any way, and better yet, it doesn't explain all the mysteries. It saves that for season two.I can't wait.Cheers."
77659,"Great show. Have been watching COVERT since season one.  The characters are great. Special kudos to Augie and Annie.  You really need to watch from the first episode so you can relate to all the characters and how the plot develops with each episode.  The truth is I watch this show (like other shows I like) on Amazon because I really, really don't like commercials.The other great TV show I watch on Amazon is CASTLE. Like above, you really need to get into the characters to enjoy. Once you do, YOU'RE HOOKED! Glad the new season is starting soon."
77660,"I bought this specifically to clean tires and wheels and it does a great job!  Whether using wheel cleaner or soap, this scrubs off the grime on my tires and wheels.  I like this one slightly less than its short-handled cousin."
77661,"Falling Skies started to take a turn for the worse in season 3 with the subplot of Anne's freaky baby. That the baby was ""different"" could have been shown subtly and without making it silly (the whole dismal mess reminded me of Chucky from theChild's Play (1988)film franchise). Season 4 starts with a dramatic attack by the Espheni, thinning out the ranks of our ragtag crew of heroes. A divide and conquer strategy is put into place by the fishheads, and the Volm are not in much of a position to help the human protagonists. Both context and gaping plot holes are established quickly in the first episode of s4.The one thing season 4 has going for it so far is that an Espheni overlord suggests to Tom that overwhelming threats greater than the Espheni are coming to Earth. This is a theme in sci-fi that tends to work well. Your once most feared enemy starts to look like a puppy dog when compared to a bigger and badder foe that rolls into town. Take for example the Scarrans inFarscape: Complete Series, who made the Peacekeepers look like the Boy Scouts upon their entrance into the series.I am worried about the health of this serial due to the emphasis on Alexis the Supernatural, who is more fitting as one of Fox Mulder's cases than a character on the now classic Falling Skies. The special effects and the potential of meeting yet another race of aliens is currently keeping me watching s4 every week."
77662,"This is Matt Smith's final special. Wonderful, yet sad. If you are just beginning your Doctor Who journey, go back to either series one (Christopher Eccleston) or start with Series 5, with the beginning of Matt's doctor."
77663,That is until he installed it and you can't even hear the pump running.  It's almost crazy the difference it makes and I wouldn't have believed it had I not read all the reviews like the one I'm entering right now.  There is nothing more annoying than listening to a pump cycle on and off!
77664,"I absolutely enjoyed watching Transparent, there's nothing like it on TV right now. I'm curious as to where these characters will go and how they will deal with this new revelation, they could have never seen coming. But this is happening and has happened in households around the world. I would love to see a full season!"
77665,"This is a good series with procedural episodes that have longer multi episode story lines mixed in. The way they tie the effects of an artifact to it's historical background is ingenious. I give this 3 stars because it's the multi episode story lines that being you back for more. The individual episode sorry lines can range from very good to very corny. Some of the special effects are sub par compared to the quality of the rest of the production. I also personally feel they tend to lighten a lot of the episodes up too much with unneeded and often poorly delivered humor. Some people however will feel this is the charm of the show. At the end of the day, if you like syfy and can look past (or enjoy) some cheesy humor or episodes that break up the good story lines then this site is very much work watching."
77666,"First off, the folks who said that it requires a 15A fuse to operate are right and so be mindful of that. It won't run with my VW Bug and blows out the fuse. However, I bought it for my Pathfinder and it does have the 15A fuse box. I've got the big tires on my SUV and this pump works really nicely. It's solidly made when you pick it up too, no plastic toy, this one. The key to making these pumps last a long time, is to not get them hot. Run it for a while and then give it a rest to cool off. High quality item and highly recommended. The coiled green hose cord reaches incredibly far and the valve attachment is precise. I like it."
77667,Fun and basic education about Biblical archaeology.  The archaeologist-narrator adds a lot of humor and quirkiness to his colorful presentation.
77668,"The best drama ever. If you haven't seen this dark series, start from the beginning and savor every twisted and lush moment to the end."
77669,This cover has kept my smoker from the elements. It fits perfectly. The smoker cover and smoker reside under a covered patio so they don't see wet weather.
77670,"I love this show. It never seems to get old. The only problem with this show is that there isn't enough time in 20ish minutes to highlight each of the characters in a given arc. Such is life though I will go on.I have noticed with this last season that the humor is being based more and more on whats going on in previous episodes. It works well if you are a diehard fan like me but trying to watch it with friends for the first time can involve some explanation. As an example when Sheldon goes to Will Wheaton's house to confront him about Amy in the first episode, Sheldon forgets which knock he is on, because he is drunk. Its a really clever sequence but if you hadn't watched the previous seasons it doesn't make any sense that he forgets what knock he is on.No worries for me though I plan to keep on watching."
77671,"This pedal is remarkable for useful tones. The sound may not be for everyone, but i already have a Boogie for the really metal like distortion. I needed something that was different but still usable, and I feel this pedal fills the bill.  The low price tag didn't hurt my feelings either. This is a win-win buying decision as far as I am concerned."
77672,I chose 4 stars because this is a really good television show but I am saving the 5 star rating for a knock your socks off show. I really enjoyed it and if I had the option I would give it 4 1/2 start.
77673,I had a problem with the cheap controller that came with my RV (travel trailer). It didn't work very well. With this one I can see visually what is going on. Much better and well worth the price.
77674,Not a lot of shine here which is great for the dash.  The other Armor All dash cleaner leaves a grease layer on top of the dash which makes it ultra reflective on the windshield. On sunny days this can blind you as you drive and be dangerous!I use this product now because it leaves behind no greasy shine and cleans well!IMPORTANT:  Whatever cleaning agent is in ICE severely dries out leather.  Avoid any material that can be damaged by having the moisture sucked out of it.....ESP leather.
77675,Works for my Behringer XM1800S Mics. It came with a smaller thread adapter on it already. Idk what mics use that but is something to note.
77676,Great tool for clamping hard to reach radiator hose clamps.  Its multi-position locking mechanism will make sure to clamp and hold various sized clamps- unlike other pliers that can only hold in the fully close position.
77677,Enjoyed it very much. Just goes to show you how dangerous that kind of driving conditions can be and the type of stamina one must have to work long hours and rough conditions. Give it a try.
77678,"I enjoyed the series, but if you're looking for serious drama, this isn't for you. Pretty unrealistic-apparently one detective on the force, and his ride along partner is the medical examiner."
77679,"These work great.Only need a small flat tip screw driver to pull back on the clips to remove the old ones and install the new ones.  Don't remove the clips completely, just pull them back a little bit and lift the hood gently at the same time.  2 people makes this a flash."
77680,"Many automobile manufacturers, including BMW, claim that the transmission oil is a &#34;lifetime fill&#34; in order to avoid the expense of replacing it during their &#34;free scheduled maintenance&#34; period. Strangely, that recommendation only happened after they started paying for that maintenance. You really do need to replace manual, and automatic, transmission oil every 30,000 miles if you want it to last a while. This is the oil to use for virtually all manual transmissions that don't take ATF."
77681,"This was such a great deal 5 plugs in a bag for a great price. Purchased these to fill out an oil change kit for a VW TDI. It looks OEM, screws in like an OEM and has the gasket like an OEM. What more could one ask for and oil pan drain plug!Dorman 090-171 Oil Drain Plug - Pack Of 5"
77682,"Californication is a very fun, wild, and inventive show. In someways it feels like a highbrow entourage minus the literal entourage. The main character, Hank Moody, is a wild bad boy writer whose fun times usually lead him into some sticky situations. There is a solid balance between love, laughter, and over the top situations. At several times you will find yourself wanting to be in Hank's shoes and other times so glad you live a relatively benign life. A very fun watch and i would recommend it to anyone that does not mind excessive profanity and at times nudity."
77683,"Schaller is sort of a household name among guitarists, because they've been making the same product for so long now.  You probably already know what this thing is and what it does.  All my electric guitars are equipped with these."
77684,I have watched this series since it started.  I love it.  The interaction between the characters make one wish that they were working with the characters in the series every day.
77685,"Has a nice smell, works like a charm. This bottle will probably last me 10 years. Good cheap price...a recommended purchase."
77686,The cradle guitar stand was for a friend. He was happy with the cradle guitar stand. Hasn't had any problems with it.
77687,"Like the prior two seasons, this season was entertaining and a departure from the usual TV offerings.  The goal of the arc team seams unending and unattainable considering the few seasons remaining.  The creature fight scenes are sometimes laughable considering the limited and/or lack of weapon use."
77688,"The pin can be moved to either of two positions, giving it a pretty wide range of motion.  Using this to remove some pretty tight ball joints that a pickle fork and some serious persuasion with a sledge hammer would not budge, this did get the job done.  However, there's a steel ball in a recess on the end of the bolt to allow the bolt to turn while you crank it down.  I put a pretty good flat spot on that ball the first time I used it.  It still works, but not quite as smoothly as when new.  There was an incredible amount of force being applied to flatten about 1/4 of a ~quarter inch steel ball, and the tool didn't break, so I guess this is alright.  Either way, this worked on my '95 BMW 740i lower control arms, where a pickle fork couldn't get a good bite and where there was no room to directly hammer on the ball joint, so I'm happy with it.  I've used it on all of my subsequent jobs, and it hasn't broken yet.Probably the main thing I'd like to see improved upon would be the use of a flanged bolt head so a wrench (like a Gear Wrench) could be easily used without slipping up the head onto the threaded area.  But a socket on a ratchet handle (preferably a large ratchet) can be used just fine."
77689,"Get the idea I liked this series. I think the whole production was well done. Writing, directing, acting, all of it...just loved it."
77690,"Ripe and ready to spray in your car!!! Great scent. Not a cheap candy smell, but a nice real, rich cherry scent. The Guys have done it again!"
77691,"The title is accurate TOO CUTE.  To me there is nothing cuter than a puppy.  This program shows the little puppies lives from total dependence on their mother until they become little rambunctious and playful creatures.  Also, according to their breed, it shows how some will be trained for service and some too become show dogs, etc.  Anyone who watches, couldn't help but want a dog as a pet and a friend.  I have had five in my lifetime.  A puppy is not only an asset in a child's life but an adult also.  I highly recommend that you watch this program."
77692,I'm very impressed really thought it would be pleather but it's real leather highly recommend this strap and it came quick
77693,"Historically accurate, gives fresh insight to the Norse people who were pagans, but had laws to protect the people.  Life in a harsh environment means a hardy and sometimes harsh people."
77694,"This review is a work in progress. As I'm writing now, the date is 5/3/11. It will be updated by 5/31/11, and again as summer rolls on and I have additional information to report. That being said....We live in the Midwest where summer months are extremely important, as we all look forward to sunshine after months of snow. Our property is wooded, and mosquitoes are a huge problem, especially since we do a lot of summer entertaining. After learning how mosquito zappers kill all the bugs that EAT mosquitoes, we tried every other option from foggers to citronella, all with little success and lots of worry about toxins around pets.I installed this unit 4/23. I took a photo, and you can see how it looks in the yard. After some pots of flowers are around it, it will blend in nicely. Setup was VERY easy, and I already had propane tanks that are used for the grill. It needs to be started up early in the season. It is nearly noiseless, and operating perfectly on what seems to be very little propane. Although I'll be updating so you can use this review as part of your decision making for this investment, I do want to share the experiences of my neighbor, who also has the Mosquito Magnet. They have had it for over one season, and had some problems. She kept getting an error light, but was able to troubleshoot it using online support. She said she would not have purchased it if she knew she would be plagued with error messages. She hasn't cranked her older unit up yet, but I'll be including her experiences in my updates. I have it at 4 stars now, as it was easy to install, lets see if it loses those stars in a few weeks!EDIT MAY 26th 2011: One bottle of propane down, and another lure later...not very many skeeters caught. Perhaps I'll try changing location. I spoke more with my neighbor who has one, and much of her problem is blowing it clean when it gets restarted in the spring. More to come in a week or so....EDIT 6/14/2011....The net bag is filled with skeetos! NO other insects, which is VERY nice. So, as a conclusion to this review...This product worked for me. If you think you can set it up and forget about it, you will be disappointed. You may have to move it around to find the best spot in your yard. A few times I checked it only to find it had stopped running. Turning it off for a few seconds and turning it back on took care of that problem. It is expensive to buy, and expensive to run. We have spent about $25-30 this month in propane and the needed lures. Still, it is cheaper and safer than having a service come and spray. MUCH safer. For us, because we entertain outside, it is worth it. While it isn't going to make your yard mosquito free, it will reduce the numbers significantly. My neighbor recently ordered a new cord as hers got lost. It was $50, but it's nice to know they can help with any bits you need. It seems like the company responded to the reviews about poor customer service. If the rest of the summer goes smoothly, we may consider upgrading units next year, that is how happy I am."
77695,"I had the opportunity to try a set of Elixir Nanoweb light gauge (.013 - .053) strings in both Phosphor Bronze and 80/20 Bronze. Instead of writing a separate review for each, I figured I&#8217;d write one review for both types of strings and post it in both places for those who are trying to figure out which strings would best meet their needs.The Phosphor Bronze strings are mounted on a brand new Guild F-47 RC guitar. It is a concert sized guitar with a Florentine cutaway. The body is Brazilian Rosewood and the top is Adirondack (Red) Spruce. I have always heard that Phosphor is a bit brighter and sounds better on a Rosewood guitar. I would agree. The tone is nicely balanced &#8211; maybe a bit weak in the bass, but the strings are new and in a couple days I expect them to sound a bit better.  The notes are articulated well, and there is a nice midrange tone.The Nanoweb coating is nice. It protects the strings from corrosion (finger sweat really can do a job on strings) without dulling the sound. I think the guitar sounds much better than it did with the original (Guild) strings, and it just plays easier.The 80/20 strings are mounted on a Gibson Hummingbird &#8211; an iconic Mahogany body/Spruce-topped Dreadnaught sized guitar. Again, 80/20s are recommended for Mahogany guitars. As popular as the Hummingbird is, I was never totally pleased with the sound of it.  It is a great guitar to strum along with while singing, but it almost sounded too muddied &#8211; not enough articulation between the different strings. The Elixir strings really bring out something extra from the Gibson. It sounds a LOT better and feels easier to play. The strings are easier to play &#8211; partially because of the coating &#8211; partially because the metal used in the string seems to have a bit more elasticity &#8211; without going out of tune.The bass is tighter and there is an even spread of tone from the lowest to the highest notes. I am very happy with how much better this guitar sounds with these strings compared to the Martin SPs that were on it prior to the switch.Elixirs are not the cheapest strings out there, but since they last a lot longer than cheaper strings, in the end you won&#8217;t spend more money on what I think are far superior strings."
77696,"Quality product,fit 2013 nicely,but took off because it's plastic,trying to remove all plastic.one of those things you get without thinking about future upgrades."
77697,"Last season was somewhat disappointing as I grew incredibly tired of the ""Days Of Our Lives"" crap between the Sheriff and his whiney wife/lying, ambitious Deputy crap. Glad as all hell to see the Deputy gone for good.The new season of course has our survivor band off the farm and apparently looking to stake claim on a prison. The whiney wife is still a cast member but she has finally seemed to have learned her place as the cheating cow she is. Perhaps now the Sheriffs son might actually survive and is becoming quite the real man that he has to be under the circumstances.I just can't wait until the scriptwriters find a way to write out the mewly wife entirely eliminating her histrionics as well as an original cast members salary. This will help toughen up the series and also help to extend the life of the show as regards budgetary matters."
77698,"I&#8217;ve always been a fan of Miracle-Gro products. . . and I like this one as well.  Though you can certainly purchase potting soil at a local gardening place perhaps for even less, it&#8217;s really great to be able to order from Amazon at a reasonable price for simple house plants.  One thing I like is that I don&#8217;t have any &#8220;weeds&#8221; with this mix.  I&#8217;ve had &#8220;weeds&#8221; in the past when I purchased something which was a lot less expensive."
77699,"I like the style of the show and it seems to have a dry sense of humor to it, and the plight of the father, who's children can not see past them selves is really well done."
77700,"I fortunately read the reviews and ordered a size larger and it is still a tight fit!Leather is OK,but the seams inside are very uncomfortable.I suggest you spend another twenty dollars and get a better glove."
77701,"USA knows how to do summer television right. With hits like Psych and Burn Notice, it's difficult for the network to do any wrong. After tackling different sides of the law, USA decided to take on the unique and fascinating world of white-collar crime in their exciting new comedy police procedural White Collar.In White Collar viewers meet con man Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer), a sophisticated white-collar thief who has finally been put behind bars by his archnemesis CIA Special Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay), an agent in the white-collar crime division. Just months before his parole comes up, Neal escapes from prison to track down his ex-girlfriend, Kate (Alexandra Daddario). Peter hunts him down, but finds that Neal may be helpful when it comes to solving white-collar crimes. After solving their first case together, Neal joins up with the CIA as a consultant and works with Peter to fight white-collar criminals.The centerpiece of the series is the hilarious relationship between Neal and Peter and the way they play off one another - basically bickering like an old married couple. Though I admit this relationship feel somewhat strained in a few episodes, it cleans up as the show goes on and the actors become more comfortable with the characters. Aside from Neal and Peter, the eccentric, quirky Mozzie (Willie Garson) constantly battles the pair for attention on scene and, honestly, occasionally wins. Garson's whimsical delivery and throughly developed character is one of the highlights of the show, and it'll be interesting to see how he continues to develop. Of course, you can't forget 90210 alum Tiffani Theissen as Peter's wife Elizabeth. Though she seems weak aside from some of the other characters, she's not the typical TV CIA wife and grows into her own lively character as the season goes on.Unlike the popular prime-time franchise CSI, White Collar focuses on sophisticated, high-end crimes such as art theft, forgery, fraud and embezzlement rather than violent crimes of passion.This allows for a fresh type of feel to police procedurals, rather than chasing criminals around New York or LA after discovering a murder, Neal and Peter put their heads together to unravel complex, sophisticated crimes that take a few more brain cells than the average murder.This three disc set is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound, but only in English. Subtitles are available in English, French and Spanish.The bonus materials were pretty good for the first season of a new show that USA was taking a gamble on. They include DVD staples such as a gag reel and deleted scenes - my personal favorites - and a handful of features that include interviews with cast and crew and a discussion of the crimes that inspired the episodes ""Pro and Con,"" ""A Cool Cat in the Hat,"" and ""Nothing But the Truth.""White Collar is another wonderful series from USA that breathes a refreshing summer breeze into some exciting television. If you haven't see the first season, you should pick it up before diving into season two, or else you'll miss some important plot points. Don't let this white-hot summer series pass you by."
77702,"This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber, but other than that, the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that."
77703,"Revised April 7, 2012 EPISODES 1-13The action is okay, the animation is pretty good, the effects and sound are good and the music isn't bad but in the end this hero's journey is just too demoralizing.  The story is supposedly about Blade search for vengeance for his mother's death but while Blade has touching farewells with relative strangers, the farewell he had with his mother under similar circumstances was horrible creating an awkward comparison and severely diminishing the resonance of Blade's mission.Blade is depicted as needing to be rescued so often he sometimes becomes a secondary character in the series.  He is stomped emotionally, physically and even literally at crucial moments.  Tough fights?  Great.  Constantly getting beat down when it matters most?  Pass.  Blade has some good points, but the first installments will only be entertaining to those who enjoy watching the hero being crucified and the thirteenth episode will be even more bizarre than it is without them.Hold your holy water and wait for the next story arc."
77704,"This show really tells me that Whedon isn't in control of his own show. Maybe I just didn't pay enough attention to who's actually in charge, but this has been a rough start. The plot isn't that interesting and I really only care about Coulson because I've really had to no reason like the rest. While Fitz and Simmons are cool and dynamic there's nothing spectacular and this show doesn't hold a flame to other shows by Whedon like Firefly or, my favorite, Dollhouse. I'm really hoping things pick up as the season goes along."
77705,One of my favorite shows and it took long to get season two out.
77706,"This is the best pilot of the group.  The pace and comedic timing were perfect, as was the satirical sendup of our media.  I really hope this gets picked up."
77707,"So I am a big fan of the SM57 Microphone as a vocal mic due to its ease of recording and good sound quality.I have a bunch of the Large Style Condenser Microphones (Rode NT1-A, AT2020, SP C-1) and they are clear, but so sensitive that it's difficult to get a solid performance and mix without them either clipping or picking up everything in the room. So if you're like me andlike to let go a bit when you sing, you should try a Dynamic Mic for the wide range and forgiveness they can giveyou when you belt a little.I did an A / B test against the SM7B I just bought and the SM57 (I love) for vocals - with the exact same processing chain, cable, settings, etc. and just switched the mics out. I sung the same passage as well, and I have to say - the SM57 sounds muddy in comparison to the SM7B. If I didn't have this new microphone I would still like the SM57, but the Genni is out of the bottle now... so not going back. The SM7B is clear and sounds sweet in comparison and still handles the vocal sound dynamics very well.DYNAMIC SINGERS ( Rock, Jazz, GOSPEL, OPERA )= If you have the budget get this SM7B and if you don't, buy the SM57 until you do have the budget.QUIET SINGERS (ACOUSTIC , FOLK ) = If you sing softly all of the time you really don't need one of these dynamic mics, and would be better off with the standard Large Condenser mics as listed above. Of those type, I like the Studio Projects C-1 Best I think, but they are close."
77708,"Well? What we have here (like in Breaking Bad's character, ""Professor White"" is an easy going likable guy sliding down a path into evil deeds. This time, though, his allie in crime is a seasoned sociapath, unlike the novice kid Walt used to teach in class. The paths of the two men constantly cross as somehow Lester Nygard, follows his mentor (Malvo).down a path of evil to Hell. Lester could redeem himself, but he chooses worse & worse things to do that make him as much if a badass as Malvo.  Billy Bob Thorton as Malvo sends  shivers down my spine.  Considering his award winning role in Slingblade this definitely replaces the bumbling retard he played in that role.  Though, in Slingblade there was a certain amount of justification for his actions, in Fargo I don't see much."
77709,"Amazon supplied an exact fit replacement, for my RV water heater. The anode rod that is part of the water heater plug had broken [by intended corrosion] before it had been entirely consumed. this new one fit perfectly."
77710,I almost gave it 4 stars since you have to be smart to assemble it.  Directions don't include the proper details.  I would write them but that's their job.  I spend 20 minutes instead of 5 or so it they explained the process better.  The stand with my guitars looks awesome.  It's perfect for 2-3 acoustics and 1-2 electric guitars.  I wouldn't load it with 7 since they would inevitably bump while putting them in or taking them out.  Nice addition to my studio.
77711,"I liked the overall story. One of the main characters uses the medium of postcards to imagine the life he desires and he also uses writing postcards as means to escape his current status. The story moved along nicely but the resolutions of the many problems encountered were rushed and incomplete. Still, this was enjoyable to watch and is a 'feel good' story."
77712,"I admit -- I am a sucker for most &#34;superhero&#34; shows.  I find Arrow very entertaining.  There are definitely some cheesy factors...but all in all, the show is enjoyable."
77713,I really enjoyed and recommend it to anybody who likes politics and would like to know more about how our great system works. Great actors and great characters.
77714,"This is not just for those under 18, this is also great for adults! It's just as good if not better than the original Avatar: The Last Airbender."
77715,"World's Greatest Dad is honestly NOTHING like I expected.  I thought it was your typical ""Angry teenage son hates father/son and father eventually bond"" type storyline, but it's nothing of the sorts.I really don't want to spoil the storyline because it's important NOT to know what happens during the second half.What you definitely need to know is that the first half is extremely vulgar thanks to Robin William's son who acts completely obnoxious towards his father, his friends, his teachers and the other kids at school.  Basically he has no manners whatsoever, and what's funny about the whole thing is how Robin Williams father character appears to let everything he does go by without *any* repercussions.However, something extremely shocking about halfway through the film completely changes the direction of the storyline.  I don't want to reveal what exactly it is that happens, but trust me, you probably won't see it coming.  Let's just say, it's at THIS point that Robin Williams becomes the main character and gets the opportunity to live out a life-long dream of his.So I'd say World's Greatest Dad has a perfect balance of drama and comedy elements.  The comedy segments are unintentionally funny perhaps because you shouldn't find them funny (even though you can't help but smile at least) and the drama segments are a big joke thanks to the storyline.Overall, well let's be honest- I've never seen a film like this before, haha.  Whoever came up with such an unusual and shocking idea for a storyline deserves a raise!"
77716,"GOOD MIX OF A QUIRKY DETECTIVE AND HIS ENTOURAGE OF STRANGE, BUT ENDEARING COLLEAGUES MADE THIS SERIES JUST PLAIN FUN TO WATCH."
77717,Love NCIS - enjoyed Season 4.  Watching every episode of every season to date to have a better understanding of the characters.  This is an awesome show.
77718,"Life is one of those dramas that leaves you thinking about what you would do if you were in a similar situation. While the series was intended to go more than the two seasons available, it comes to a somewhat satisfactory close at the end of the season, but definitely wanting more. Damian Lewis is outstanding as Detective &#34;New Money&#34; working his way through cases facing the LAPD. Strongly recommended (both seasons)."
77719,"When you need to remove your door panels without harming the mountings, you will want a tool set like these.These are very effective, made of moderately firm but compliant plastic to get the job done.Unless you are a professional installer, these are a great choice for this task and do it very cost effectively."
77720,"There was a groundhog digging all around our shed, he had entrances at all four sides of the shed, and we couldn't get rid of it for ages. This year I applied the Critter Ridder at each of his holes and I see vegetation growing around undisturbed, and I didn't  see the animal since then.Most important, it didn't smell of urine as other repellents, so I could actually enjoy my yard after applicationMy only complaint was with the jar shaker cover, it lets too much product out so you should be careful and not dump the mix all in one big pile.Edit on September 28, 2012: the company representative commented on my post that the lid has adjustable opening, I checked the package, and it is true - you can open it halfway, and it ""clicks"" in this position, so it won't slide as you shake. I wish I realized it earlier.And I still do not see the groundhog, so the repellent still works, maybe it is because I applied too much of it earlier."
77721,"I love BBC and this is one of my favorite shows second to Sherlok.  It has some great characters and even when they change in other seasons, I loved then as well.  Great storyline, and the special effects are what you would expect from a BBC show.  They work with what they got and they do an amazing job."
77722,I hesitant to use this product when I received it. At least (5) warnings. Also Amazon will not let you return it!!! The product really works very well. I suggest you use it in a well ventilated area. It will make tired and worn vinyl look new. It is worth the price.
77723,"This is a must have for the little Intex pools. Not only does it clean up all the dirt, it sucked up almost of the dead algae that the filter is just not strong enough for. Last year I ended up dumping my pool due to algae..this year the Aqua Broom was a lifesaver! My pool was clear within a day! Used for the Intex 15' by 48""Metal Frame pool. Thanks"
77724,"Purchased this to maintain the battery in one of my vehicles that sits over the winter.Shipped extremely fast (received next day) and just got done hooking it up. I remove the battery from my vehicle because I didn't have any outlets near the car and I didn't want to run an extension cord because I am sure someone would trip on it or unplug it.This unit came with 2 cords to attach to the battery (via alligator clips or ring terminals). I ended up using the alligator clips and everything worked out just fine.I then plugged the unit into the wall and the red light came on which means that the battery needed to be charged. It's been on for about an hour now, but that's ok with me because I purchased this thing to maintain the battery, not to rapidly charge it.I do like the fact that the manufacturer offers a 10 year warranty for this item, however it clearly states in the manual that you need to send $15.95 with the unit for evaluation, shipping & handling. Then the warranty card states that if any repairs need to be made, the company will notify you of the cost. Sounds like some sort of a screwy scam to me, but if this unit ever fails (hopefully in many years to come) I will simply purchase another one because I am sure it would cost you about $5-10 to ship the unit back to the manufacturer, then you need to include your $16 fee and then pay for any repairs. The darn thing only costs $40...why would you pay and waste your time trying to collect on the warranty?All in all, I like this thing and as long as it works for many years I will be happy.***UPDATE 2/18***I ended up putting the battery back in the car and running a HD extension cord.I've checked the battery every few days with a volt meter and it is holding constant at about 13.27 volts.Still happy with my purchase."
77725,Just a smidge of this product will turn a once tarnished nasty piece of aluminum into a beautiful shine that you wouldn't believe. Really you can see your reflection in the surface after polishing it up. Will always purchase Mothers Mag and Al polish
77726,"As someone that has fought with more than my share of rusty or bent traditional tomato cages, I was happy to see this alternative.  Granted, it will be awhile to see if it shows weather wear, this is a solid cage that can be used to grow more than just tomatoes.  Any item from food to flowers could benefit from the climbing range and support.I prefer the shape of the support over the traditional round cage.  That circle shape was constantly getting dented or broken.  It just didn't make sense.  This gives more structured support and the greater height means I won't have plants breaking from climbing too high.I also found it easy to move as well as store.Overall, this is a great way to give your plants the best start to produce the most product...whether it be fruits, vegetables, or flowers."
77727,"At our local Ace store a 3.5 ounce bag of Kaytee mealworms is going for 13 dollars. Using that price as a barometer, this large bag of mealworms is a tremendous bargain. Our bluebirds like eating the mealworms, so we like having plenty on hand.They seem to like the mealworms even more if the worms are soaked in water or olive oil first. Maybe when moistened the worms look fresher to the birds.Bottom line - If you are going to buy mealworms, don't pass up this deal."
77728,These refrigerator bars work well to keep your food from shifting around while driving down the road. They are adjustable and have strong springs which allow them to be moved and remain in place. The fridge in our camper did not come with any devices to keep food from moving around and we would often open the door after driving and have some of the contents spill out. These bars will prevent most of that from occurring.
77729,"Educational and thoroughly enjoyable on many levels.  Highly recommended.  Great story with fantastic acting.  It doesn't get much better than I, Claudius."
77730,"I'm willing to give this more of a chance, but I don't want to waste too much more time on it.  A boring pilot is all I can claim to have seen thus far, with a simply horrible, irritating sound track.  I hope it picks up."
77731,"I love the music from this TV series. The only thing that hits it hard for me is that it is very controversial. It hits every controversial subject out there, and it feels like this year there is too much to take in at one time. They have the graduates come back as well as having all new people. The controversial issues in this series combined with the same ones as last year might be too much. What this series needs is closure so the watchers can move on. In this series so far they are becoming a little overwhelming with the issues and drama it sparks."
77732,The vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone. It now rest at bottom of a box.
77733,"I recieved this recovery strap and it was the same brand as advertised, however the loops on the end came with black durable nyon protection sewn in liike some of the others I've seen. This was good as I was going to purchase a more expensive strap because it had the reinforcements, but this one ended up having them too."
77734,"&#8220;Redemption&#8221; (also known as &#8220;Hummingbird&#8221;) stars Jason Statham as a former Special Forces coming back from Afghanistan, but those who are expecting something like the &#8220;Transporter&#8221; series would be disappointed with the crime drama set in today&#8217;s underground London. The brooding film is more like a character study, following the story of Joseph Smith (Statham), a veteran who goes AWOL, currently living in London as a homeless.Joseph is given a chance to start over his life, when he enters an apartment room of someone who is now away from home. He then starts working for Mr. Choy (Benedict Wong), a crime lord who is involved in human trafficking. In the meanwhile, he attempts to use his newly gained power to do the right things. The film also follows the relationship between Joseph and a nun Cristina (Agata Buzek), which is the most unique aspect of the film.So, in &#8220;Redemption&#8221; Jason Statham shows what he can do as an actor. Though personally I prefer to watch another &#8220;Transporter&#8221; sequel, I think he did a decent job. But, while &#8220;Redemption&#8221; benefits from Chris Menges&#8217; moody photography, the film itself lacks rhythm, suffering from the flat narrative.Probably &#8220;Redemption&#8221; will be remembered as Steven Knight&#8217;s debut work as director. Knight has been known for his screenplays for &#8220;Dirty Pretty Things&#8221; and &#8220;Eastern Promises.&#8221; In a sense &#8220;Redemption&#8221; may be called the third film of his &#8220;London underworld trilogy&#8221; and is the least effective one."
77735,"It's a pity there aren't other black male characters to balance out the characterization of Luther as being handicapped by his temper despite his superior intelligence.  Anyhoo, this show is much more watchable than the usual BBC fare including Doctor Who.  Of course, I prefer The Wire but this is okay as long as it continues to introduce such frightening English villians in every episode. Very scary."
77736,Good production and editing in the following of compelling true crime stories. Viewers follow the trail of evidentiary leads as law enforcement teams track murderers attempting to elude being identified and brought to justice.
77737,"This is an allegory for aging professionals who have sacrificed everything to do one thing well and would like to be more widely recognized for it just once. I'll bet Hollywood actors over 50 feel some kinship with this character.  In the end, it's not the size of the crowds but how much they enjoy it.  Like Bob Dylan, he just keeps going whether his popularity is up or down.  What else is there?"
77738,"I bought a new guitar & got it a day before my fingerease was delivered. My fingers were squeeking & sticking on the strings & back of neck, BAD!!After applying fingerease no more squeeks & much easier to move up & down the fretboard!!This stuff has been around for years.1st time I saw it was 40 years ago.Can't argue with that track record!!If you never used it get a can, you won't regret it!!Joe"
77739,"This is a great mystery series produced by the BBC highlighting the work of Inspector Lewis who is a good working class detective working in an intellectual community.  He does not relate well with the people around him both in the community and even, to an extent, his coworkers and supervisor.  They fight him at times but respect him for his doggedness and success.  This is well worth watching if you enjoy British mystery stories.  Think of a British version of &#34;Law & Order&#34; but without the courtroom portion."
77740,Love these pedals good buy
77741,"This is a stellar detective show. Serious, but not gruesome. It is very adult, but they all have a sense of humor also. First rate."
77742,This tool is the  epitome of convenience. I use it primarily in my raised garden bed to trim the tomato plants and other functions. The scissors are very sharp and provide nice clean cuts. The wire cutter comes in handy as well when I use wire to provide support to my lightweight tomato cages by fastening them to bamboo poles. One outer edge of the scissors is also very sharp and comes in handy when a slice is needed in lieu of a cut. The other outer edge of the scissors is serrated. The case that is provided is the best way to carry this tool  because its sharpness has the potential to perform unwanted incisions to certain mid-body parts if carried in a pocket. This is an excellent tool.
77743,"A strap is a strap, what can you really say about it? It was about $5 with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine. It's comfortable and fits my bass well. I'm a bigger guy and have plenty of length if I needed it. Nice value."
77744,"I'm loving this pop filter! It looks professional in design, and feels very sturdy on the mic stand. The built in shock mount is definitely a plus. I like it because some beginners try to grab the mic in the studio when recording vocals. This immediately let's them know to just speak into the microphone. Also offers the option of removing the pop screen if you want. Amazon was great in conjunction with the seller! My item arrived lightning fast! Amazon is like music to my ears, and that's why their products are in my studio. Simply THE BOMB!!!!!"
77745,"Do not expect a studio quality out put from this unit. That said, for the price it is an excellent product. Obviously, if you are looking for a studio quality mic you would not be here. This product does what it supposed to do and exceeds your expectations. For a normal use this is quite good. Feels little tiny but excellent gain. I would buy it again if required."
77746,"Figured I should buy this while I had to replace the knock sensors. Recently purchased a 2004 Tahoe Z71 that had the knock sensor codes and was recommended by many others to replace the harness while I was working under the intake. Well, I certainly NEEDED to replace it as I barely pulled on the rear one and it just fell apart in my hand. The front was fine but rear, almost crumbled in my hand! Was very glad these were perfect fit, length, etc. They came shipped in nice packaging and easy to install. I recommend the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002UEN1U/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5 to place on top to help prevent any further water from entering into the knock sensor chamber and deteriorating the new harness and sensor. Highly recommend this harness from this vendor."
77747,I loved when the Originals was introduced on Vampire Diaries. I was ready for the new show when it aired. I like downloading the episodes so I can watch them as many times as I want.
77748,"Being available at Amazon at a great price is only part of the advantage.  This is a LONG  tool, and would have been tricky to get home in a Corolla.  Amazon made it usual terrific to-the-door delivery.  The tool-user of the group took it in hand and proceeded to spruce the property, with a snickety-sharp blade that is a pleasure to use.  It is presently stored in a clothes closet, which is not ideal and not expected to be permanent, but that conveys what is possible.  No assembly was required."
77749,"It just arrived and took all of 30 seconds to install on my grill.I cooked my first chicken on it this evening and it was incredibly juicy and tender (I did brine it for about 8 hours) even the breast was juicy which normally ends up being dry with other cooking methods.The motor seems to have good torque, the spit turned very smoothly without jerking or jittering as I have seen with cheap rotisseries.I enjoy grilling but not necessarily when chicken is involved - steaks and chops cook fairly quickly but chicken needs slower cooking and you need to keep an eye on it - with the rotisserie I can get it going and more or less forget about for most of the cooking time.Glad I bought it."
77750,I wished the show was never cancelled .. So they could have finished the show but overall it was good. Story was very interesting made you think a lot .. At times it was a bit slow but it felt as they was holding back on the story to add into season 2 but the ending was really bad since it left me wanting more .. But overall the show was good
77751,"This is the kind of show I watch when I have something else to do (dishes, filing, whatever). It's fine, but by Season 3, the same themes of backstabbing and office politics/betrayal/OMG you didn't go to Harvard are becoming rather tedious. The women are poured into their dresses and teetering about on 5-inch heels, so that's fairly goofy after a while. The original premise of a brilliant, unconventional guy who has landed in the middle of a high-powered law firm carried the first season but now that his soul has been captured and he has become one with the enemy, I'm not sure I'll sign up for much more of this."
77752,"Life is a brilliant series that lasted only 2 seasons for reasons unknown. It is very sad, very funny, and insightful."
77753,"I really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use. However, it broke not too long after I bought it. One of the connections broke, that is. I think they might have made it a little more durable since then. Moreover, I sent it in and they replaced it, so that was cool. It would be nice, though, not to have had to do that."
77754,"I have 3 of these and highly recommend them as a ""deterrant"".  Yes, if someone is determined it can be broken off or they can stab the tank, but quick gas theft can be avoided if they can find a car with a non-locking gas cap (put a small sticker on your gas panel that states locking gas cap and the door may not be pried open, it may be passed up).  Avoid pranks, vandalism, and gas theft with these.  They are a little hard to figure out initially but simple after that.  I have never had a dash light come on from these for leaking, on '09 Tacoma, '08, '11 IS250, and '12 Tundra, or '04 RX-330 (different type/model number). Excellent value.Update Oct. 2012:Excellent device and value. Always works great and easily. Worth it with high fuel prices.Update June 2013:These work great and I bought two more; one for a Chevy Aveo, and one to replace a lost locking cap, as there is no tether, nor are they made for one. My wife and I have never had a bad experience with these. Easy to use, just practice with them before you get to the pump. It locks and clicks with the key out. When you want to open it just insert the key, turn it CCW, then CW to remove the key. It locks easily and is removed easily. I disaggree with the negative reviews, but I also disaggree with the sizing advice from Amazon, do some research. If yours screws do not get one without screws, if the OEM has no screws do not get one with screws. The photos seem to be accurate. Example: I contacted Stant and they recommended a non screw 10506 for my Tacoma and Tundra yet they take a screw type 10504, not the 10506, so do your research."
77755,"i did not 'expect' the twist of the female captains role, being challenged by the promoted assistant chief, but if the writing returns to what it was when the program was 'the closer' then a return of the former female deputy chief, Brenda, with a new role and job with the district attorneys office may provide more 'female clout and authority from both departments leading females, which is what I thought would take place when the changes were mentioned in the last season of the 'closer'. time will tell, and I will keep watching."
77756,Replaced the original filter with this one and haven't smelled any mustiness since.Perfect fit and inexpensive. Better than buying the OEM filter for sure
77757,"This has been a great set for me to use in my garden.  I particularly enjoy the numbers on the one trowel when I'm planting tulips and other bulbs in the fall (particularly since I've lost my bulb planter!) and the other two, well, I just use them all the time.  Like another reviewer said, you really cannot use these in thick, heavy soil because they WILL break.  However, if the soil is that heavy, you should be using a garden shovel anyway to loosen up the soil.Just a very nice set, rivals my solid stainless steel ones!  Recommend!"
77758,"Great product for the price. It's a good replacment wiper for my 2007 Lexus RX350 AWD (Rear). I have purchased several different brands (all at a much higher price), and this one seems just as good as the rest. Bonus it's cheaper than the rest"
77759,"I used this kit to restore my gauge bezel lens to my 1981 Trans Am. I was skeptical as my lens had both deep scratches as well as paint stuck on them. Once I got to the step of using the 3000 grit pad it became obvious that this kit was working. When I was done the lens looked brand new where I worked on it. In my case, I did not do all of the lens, I only focused my attention to where the lens will be seen through the gauges.The whole process I wore a mask and safety glasses. I can tell you if you use this system outside with a slow RPM drill there is not that much dust. I used my Craftsman 3C 19.2 volt cordless drill set on high with the clutch in ""drill"" gear. I used the variable trigger to feather the speed of the drill. I never let the drill go beyond 1/2 it's normal speed during the whole process. I spent most of my time using the 800 grit disk, the last two pads do not take long at all to clear the lens.There is another version of this kit, I think the number is 39045, that includes painters tape to protect your body paint around the headlights. That product is not necessary if you have painters tape or are polishing your lenses off the car."
77760,I replaced my burned out SilverStar with a set of these. I have not had them long enough to rate their life span but the emitted light is very bright and welcomed by my aging eyes. I would say they are brighter than my SilverStars but since I don't drive after dark very much that could not be a positive statement. I am very pleased with them so far.
77761,I just bought a season pass to &#34;Almost Human&#34; and I love it. It's a nice mix of robots and police men solving crimes and these two trying to get along. I think the endearing part about the show is that the robot is more humane than his human partner. There is a nice mixture of humor and high tech to keep me interested. I highly recommend it to anyone who liked Monk or Sherlock Holmes.
77762,Justified is one of the best Series that I've watched.  Every Episode and Season is GREAT!  I just wish that Justified Season 5 would become one of the Amazon Prime collections!  Maybe soon!
77763,"These rockwool cubes are a good way to start cuttings. Light, sterile, easy to handle and affordable. They do the trick."
77764,"Well, as I only received this about three weeks ago, and the box says very plainly that it takes 60 to 90 days to actually see what the results vis-a-vis this product and my collection of well-dried leaves and garden waste will be ... so I must defer final judgement at this point. Unaided, it seems to take at least six months to produce anything usable, so any promise of improvement on that is well worth waiting fore. I'll update the review then!"
77765,"I honestly thought that Bosch would be my favorite new original show, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mozart of the Jungle was just as engaging. The premise is nothing new, but the twist is that instead of country, pop, rock, or rap, we get a peek into the world of Classical music, one of the oldest and most revered styles today. This lends itself well to the decadent parties and attitudes of those who've made it, and explains the young but out there style of those still hoping to succeed.The cast is young, attractive, and most importantly talented. The lead is charming and engaging. Malcolm McDowell is flawless, as always, Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal plays the eccentric young genius very well, and Saffron Burrows smolders nicely as the experienced voice of wisdom. This show would be a get on any channel, so I certainly hope Amazon decides to produce more episodes."
77766,A very interesting concept done by the 2nd actor we're aware of with the name Robert Taylor.  We loved the first actor with this name & this one does not disappoint.
77767,"It seems everything I have read/reviewed has to do with the durability of the outside surfaces coming in contact with abrasive surfaces.  The other thing I have encountered in use, is the angle or grade is important to just how well camper holding tanks can be emptied.  We are using this in conjunction with sewer hose support brackets to control the amount of any dips that would try to occur over the length of the run to the  sewer connection or even the Thetford 40515 Smart-Tote when placed on a slope to help with draining the trailer tanks.Important to Note:  The tank holds 27 gallons, but be sure to take into consideration any fluids in the hose system when connecting and disconnecting to the main valve of the trailer.  I also made an anti-abrasive ground sleeve (we encounter a lot of gravel and asphalt) for the unit, with multiple handles that help us better handle the length of the hose, while spreading it out over the ground support brackets, and does not interfere with the brackets making solid contact with the hose."
77768,"That doesn't mean it was bad.  It was just that everything was just a notch under what would be on the big screen.I gave it four stars because visuals are not always what makes the movie.The plot was good; the acting was decent; the dialogue was very good, I thought.In the end, I was entertained.  To me, that's worth 3 stars and it was just a bit better than that."
77769,The plot moves slowly and the characters aren't that compelling. I go back to this series from time to time to &#34;cleanse my palate&#34; so to say.
77770,The CDs arrived timely and in good condition. NCIS just keeps getting better.  I do not fin d the interaction of Jethro and the FBI agent based on a mutual ex-wife of much interest.
77771,"I bought one for my tenor and a different brand for my soprano Ukulele,,  I found I like the snark better for the dollar more in cost..  the other has multi use ( bass, chord, ukulele ) and seemed cheap,  I liked the snark so much I bought this one for my concert ukulele,,  you might ask, Huh  why one for each ukulele,  if you play,, then the answer is simple, for 10 bucks I do not have to hassle swapping tuners out,, and can just grab my ukulele and go."
77772,"I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window, under an awning on the northeast side of the house, not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...."
77773,"As prompted, &#34;it's okay&#34; but I strongly suspect Season 1 will be enough for me."
77774,"Excellent fit in the end but very difficult to install with the tool provided. The tool sent was defective, too hard to use to connect the spring. I ended up just placing the screen over the exhaust and closing the door and it works well. I think the connection spring attachment and tool need a re-design and better quality control but I highly recommend these screens for hole protection. They just need patience and creativity. Modify the tool as needed before application.Update 6-21-13:I used one of these on my Tankless Water Heater exhaust Vent as it had a large space around it and there was plenty of room for nesting in the exhaust and in the compartment. Since I need to access the heater switch to turn it on and off, the screen cover would come off the exhaust port. The exhaust pipe itself has a larger-holed screen within. I ended up screwing the supplied spring to the approximate center of the screen cover to shorten the spring and improved retention then hooking the spring to the built in internal screen (with a just-found previously provided screen-spring tool). The screen stays on now when I open the decorative unit side cover.The manufacturer legally has to tell you not to cover vents (to keep out wasps), but, as long as you periodically check and clean the screen it in no way restricts air flow. The decorative side cover keeps the screen centered in the exhaust hole, to screen it off from invaders and the spring retains the exhaust screen cover when the side panel is opened.There is also louvered intake venting. I ordered a large flat SS screen and cut it to size over the internal louvers with metal snips. There is plenty of air space but no place for wasps or mud daubbers. This solved my problem with the Tankless Water Heater unit. I bought the preformed screen for my RV air heater and it fit perfectly. If you are concerned about restricting air flow, just inspect it when you go through your set-up list and use a can of compressed air (Costco) to spray it clear of dust as you like. If you do not have a wasp problem don't use them. Hope this helps someone."
77775,"This is the perfect title for this show.  I would call this along the line of the incredible hulk with an extra beauty as an addition. The way the guy is made up when he gets upset looks pretty damn good for being a ""beast"".  I have not missed an episode since it started.  The girl plays a beautiful cop with a bit of ""beast"" in her sort of like Chuck Norris. The friendship develops very strong and is a perfect addition to make the entire show."
77776,Easy to install.  Work great.  Last forever.  They use so little energy I never need to worry about killing the battery with the engine off.
77777,"It's easy to install, very tough, and I love how it looks. It can support quite a bit of weight (assuming you properly installed it on a stud, and not in drywall) and helps with cable management on a rough day."
77778,One of the Best Filters on the market.  Highest quality construction and features with an OEM fit.  A high performance filter that cost more but will keep your vehicle's engine components running smoothly.
77779,I should have had one of these long ago for my Harley and Diesel truck but was too tight to buy one. I did the old elbow grease job.I didn't think my battery powered drill would hold-up and I didn't wanna mess with a cord. The ball knocks the job out quick with my electric drill and when I get done with my Harley it gives me more time to ride and let momma luv on me from behind.The thing should last forever and the red makes it easy to spot by an old man.buy one or two and quit thinking stupid like I was.
77780,I decided I didn't need mine because my leveler came with a great ratchit. It's more of a pain to carry a drill than to use the ratchit!
77781,I love swamp people.  The first three shows of season five are not new though. They are replays of other seasons.
77782,"I gave it 2 stars because I liked the concept -- alien life purposely brought back to Earth, accidentally let loose -- so I decided to give it a go.  So not worth it. Nothing happens.  Nothing.  It is boring.  No, let me correct that.  It is BOOOOOORING!!!!  Way too many areas of the plot left unexplored; way too much meaningless conversation that does nothing to advance the plot; way too little character development; way too many unanswered questions; and the &#34;plot twist&#34; at the end was incomplete."
77783,"Justified never fails to be entertaining.  Character development is a real strength of this show.  Raylan's great, but his supporting cast just makes it better!"
77784,"This little show is great. The funny part for our household is that one of the ten kids in my daughter's play school class (she's four) wears an Angry Birds shirt so the kids know about Angry Birds (we don't let her play that game). Anyway, my daughter calls Peep and the Big Wide World, Angry Birds. For some reason I find this sweet. The show has nice messages and does a little Sesame Street style thing at the end of each episode where they show children working on something related to the message in the cartoon."
77785,"I thoroughly enjoyed this and can certainly related to geeky outsiders. Been there - Done that. But I have to wonder were can future episodes go. If they don't succeed - what's the point, and if they do succeed - what's the point?Now, someone could steal their application, and they could struggle to both prove it was stolen while trying to come up with a new idea, but that eventually gets resolved too.If there were in a regular situation where continual storyline could be fed in, like tech support guys. But this hinges on the success of failure of this current Application, and you can't string that out forever.Perhaps, there is a plan for the show, and I just don't see it ... then again, perhaps not.But I did enjoy it and I can relate to the characters. Also, I do think Geek-Sheek is a big thing. Once we were the unseen downtrodden, but now - Nerd is Cool.But, I still wonder where the series can go?"
77786,"very easy to use and set up and EXTREMELY well constructed. We had two rats running around our garage. Caught both of them, one after another, using peanut butter as bait. This trap will last for years to come if we ever need it again. Great deal, would order it again in a heartbeat."
77787,"London Hospital is the true story of this hospital's beginnings, as based on newspaper reports, diaries and other information.It gives a realistic portrayal of how the nursing professional came about, and how hospitals were founded.  The scripts are realistic, and the acting is great."
77788,"This is the only MG fert with Magnesium in the mix natively. It really does a good number as a General Purpose Fert for anything that likes a balanced diet ... Oh and Tomatoes really do like this one over the 24-8-16 mix which will just leave them flowering into October ... IHMO. ( Too much N compared to P and K you see, for a matto to go all the way. 18-20-21 is about perfect. )"
77789,I am sure this will work fine next fall when I put the bikes to sleep for the winter. I borrowed a can of fogger from a friend of mine for this winter.
77790,This adjustable flower pot is very easy to use. Just attach the L shaped brackets depending on the width of what you are hanging it on. It is best on something like a deck railing as the top of this will be about level with the top of the railing so most what you will see is the plant. It could be used on a fence too but may be a bit too high.
77791,Always interested in the &#34;Cajun&#34; genre' and was not disappointed with this show.  The characters (employees) of this department were each &#34;featured&#34; rather nicely on different shows where they encounter different problems but found the antics / teasing between the officers an entertaining way to end each episode.Keep up the good work.
77792,Replaced my beloved Small clone chorus with this pedal and I'm glad I did. This is one lush pedal and it's all analog. This pedal also sounds great with gain.
77793,"I can't remember how many years ago I started using this great stuff.  Like everything else, moderation is the key and having good clean neck and strings is where it all starts, but a quick spray and a wipedown with a lint free cloth does wonders before every time I play!"
77794,"Any film with Jude Law and Anthony Hopkins in it can't be bad.  This one consists of a number of vignettes from around the world with a cast of characters who are all interconnected, however tenuously, and are all changed in the end, definitively.  It's an illustration of Lorenz's butterfly effect, in which minuscule actions, like the flapping of a single butterfly's wings, can alter future weather patterns.  In this case, the decisions of individuals affect the lives of others more than they will ever know.  Life is a circle that keeps going 'round and 'round through our own tiny, individual actions.  It's an elegantly philosophical film."
77795,I have a 1993 Taylor which is in mint condition. I always use Martin on any acoustic. I bought the Taylor about 6 months ago and have found that the Medium Martin Strings are best for this particular guitar ... every acoustic is different though.
77796,"I enjoyed watching this show. Seems like the producers thought that they should limit filming of vacuuming gravel and sorting for gold. Actually that's the best part. To replace the filming of actual gold mining, they created false issues and fake fights. I didn't care for the fake drama. I wanted to see more of the mining and the gold."
77797,"I have to tell you that I am completely delighted with this vacuum-blower.  It fits my needs perfectly.  There are many elements to our home which makes this machine ideal for our particular needs.First we have driveway...long driveways.  These things constantly need cleaning, both summer, winter, spring and fall, as we have a very, very large number of very large trees.  This machine is ideal for keeping the leaves, twigs, crass cuttings and other ""stuff"" off of the roadway.Secondly, we have patios.  As with the driveways, they are surrounded by trees, trees and more trees.Third, we have a large screened in back porch.  This is where the dogs and I hang out most of the year.  This is also where I do my wood carving.  The floor of the porch is always covered with wood shavings.  I try to keep them swept-up....but he, you know how that goes.  This machine sucks the shaving up quite nicely and the dogs love to bark and chase the thing as I work with it.  I also store my birdseed on this porch in three large cans.  I am constantly spilling the stuff and making quite a mess.  Again, this little machine makes short work of that problem. They like to chase the broom too, but after they got use to it, the vacuum seems to give them more pleasure.Forth, we have a large number of oddly shaped rock gardens and raised flower beds.  Leaves are a real pain to remove; often requiring being on my hands and knees digging them out of crooks and crannies.  This blower and the vacuum cut my work in this are by at least  th.Fifth, this works great as a dust-buster in the house and in the storage sheds out back - including my workshop.  I am too cheap to buy a decent shop-vac and this will do nicely until the day I break down...if that ever happens.Sixth, this is a comparatively light machine and easy to handle.  At my age a few pounds makes a very big difference.  Despite the smallness of the unit, it does generate a great amount of power.Now is this unit adequate to remove or move heavy leaves from a large yard?  No.  But then I have a large gas operated one for that along with a leave removal machine for the back of my yard tractor.  This unit is meant for smaller jobs and it works much, much better than I expected...I am delighted as a matter of fact.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"
77798,"I ordered two of these, one to hold music, and one to hold a netbook computer. I am very happy with how it performs in both situations. High quality, solid support, and good design decisions all around. The angle adjustment is very solid and it should be able to hold a very heavy book of music or a medium sized computer.The arm is just long enough that if turn the platform sideways, you can lean the music stand back next to the mic stand that it is attached to. I will try to add pictures when I get a chance.This is really two products that work together: a short boom arm with a mic attachment, and a narrow music stand that mounts onto a standard microphone thread base. I am using one stand attached to a mic stand, and a second with the arm removed, mounted directly onto a &#34;Gibraltar Multi-Mount Microphone Clamp&#34;. Major bonus points for making a solid piece of gear that is also modular and flexible.Note: the music stand easily detaches from the adjustable-angle part for storage. This is great, but be aware that the lock nut does not do a good job of &#34;locking&#34;, so if you turn the stand upside down, the it will fall off. This could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations.Final verdict: I own two, and am considering buying one of the full-width (MUS-ARM 2) models also."
77799,"Screws, just the right size. Shipped free as an add on item, at the time. No brains er...what else?"
77800,Great product.  Easy and fast installation with great directions.  They even had pictures!  Nice product and it works great.
77801,Now I will have to go back to just hating politicians.  &#60;sigh&#62; So limiting.  Hands down this has brought some of the best actors and  writers to TV.  For those of you who think 'The Wire' is better...all I can say is you are out of your ever-lovin' minds.  I have never enjoyed disliking so many people in all my years of watching TV.  It has been to TV drama what Seinfeld was to TV comedy.
77802,The range is great and the temps seem pretty accurate. It's a great tool when you're doing some all day smoking.
77803,"Yes I enjoyed the first season of this show, that I thought was a summer fill in.  I was happy to suspend my disbelief in the fantasy premise of a boutique practice in the Hamptons. By the last show of the season the scripts had become boiler plates with fill in the blanks for the next show. The characters were one dimensional pulled out of a royalty free store for characters.  Credit is due to the strength of the cast. All are engaging and held my interest enough to watch through the end of the season. They all had the chops to make a cardboard character look like more than than it really was. In spite of the efforts of the cast this show was too thin for me to watch a second season"
77804,"This is a good homeowner-quality hedge trimmer.  It's not designed to be a commercial tool, nor is it priced in that category....there are other choices if you need to spend three hours a day trimming hedges.  All-in-all, though, I like it.Pros:- 24"" blade provides extra reach over most other trimmers.  Even the corded and gas powered units are mostly in the 18-22"" range.- The 24 volt battery should provide (at least theoretically) more power than the 18 volt versions.  Being battery powered, you have, of course, unlimited portability.- Well balanced and easy to hold.  This is obviously important if you're going to use it for any length of time.- A 3/4"" branch will fit between the teeth.  Anything larger and you need a good pair of loppers.- Being bright orange, it's almost impossible to accidentally leave it outside.Cons:- Only one battery is included with the trimmer.  Fully charged, it lasted for roughly 20 minutes of cutting time.- The standard charger takes NINE HOURS to charge the battery.- The battery is Nickel Cadmium, not Nickel Metal Hydride, or a lighter weight, higher energy-density Li-ion battery.  NiCd batteries have a fairly rapid self-discharge cycle...just sitting on a shelf, a fully charged cell will lose a significant amount of charge in a couple of months.  They also suffer from a significant memory effect.  If you repeatedly only partially discharge the battery, it'll eventually lose the ability to retain a full charge.- A spare battery and a high-speed two-hour charger are available, but basically double the initial cost.- The blade cover works, but it's thin floppy vinyl.  I doubt it cost over 5 cents to make.It was really a toss-up to give this three or four stars.  The battery is clearly its weak point.  My standards for tools are pretty high.  As I said at the beginning, this isn't designed for heavy-duty use; rather it's targeted at homeowners.  And from that perspective, it's pretty good.  It's certainly fine for my needs."
77805,"I've owned six different types of rodent traps. This one has been the most consistent. It has even caught two birds! (birds were surprised, but uninjured and released healthy) We have have many species of rodents around our house, but only two create a health problem or damage problem.  This trap humanely captures all of them, and allows us to release the non-harmful rodents uninjured.  The harmful rodents can then be euthanized humanely. This is the most humane and effective process for small animals I've found so far. Yes, the trap can trip from strong winds, and yes it can be tripped without a catch. It's also a one-shot deal so you get one animal per setting. We can live with this - nothing is perfect. The trap can be a little frustrating to set if you've had too much coffee as well, but you get the hang of it.Update 7/10/12Be careful not to get the ""Grips"" livetrap which is a knock off of Havahart. The trigger wire does not have a flat spot which makes it very difficult to set and it trips without trapping frequently. Grips also appears to fall apart easily.  The Havaharts have been catching mice, voles, chipmunks and ground squirrels more effectively than any other trap.  Is also completely humane. We're only after the mice and voles (they damage things) so we let the others go without injury. CHECK YOUR TRAPS OFTEN or these become quite IN-humane."
77806,Love this show.  Its fast pace and female lead character make it a good choice.
77807,"look into the world of people who choose to live life differently, more independent and self supporting life style with hardships that make them stronger"
77808,"I dont really like violent films unless its creatures againts manking kinda stuff.And these days there's a lot of gore and violence out there in movieland.Someone lent me this movie and i decided to watch it. I did enjoy it becausewe kinda care for that hobo as he ends up in a town from hell that is been heldhostage by a kingping and his sons in a type of cartoon violence, a bit like the old batman series. Anyway its over the top, i did reckonized abunch of Canadian actors...(ricky from trailer park boys) and i would recommendit for what it is."
77809,Some very strong character development from all the actors. It is a pleasure to watch something that doesn't bill itself as &#34;reality TV&#34; yet continues to make me believe in what's happening.  Keep up the good work!
77810,"The up and coming female lead just landed a role in a new American TV series due to launch in summer of 2014.  She under acts just about everything and while refreshing (not leading with cleavage like most American actresses) it is a bit slow at times.  I do love the ornery, alcoholic boss and the rather commonplace fellow detectives because they lend a bit more credence to the story although there are lots of reflections of past British mysteries (e.g. overweight cop with eating disorder in Blood in the Wire).The plot line is standard very good British mystery and well worth the watch for the entire series."
77811,"This is a great brush and it's very inexpensive, what more do you need to know?Okay, so a few more details:The brush has a nice curved shape to it which really conforms nicely to a normal size tire (low profile tires may not work as well).  The bristles are plenty stiff for cleaning a tire, if they were any stiffer you would tear up the rubber.  With a good cleaner (I use Meguiars APC+), this brush will work great to agitate the cleaner and remove grime and old layers of tire dressings.  The handle is very ergonomic and allows you to apply a good amount of force into the scrubbing with minimal discomfort.Overall a good brush and well worth the $7.  It appears very sturdy and I am guessing this will last many years."
77812,"With the limited counter space, this fits the bill in my camper. I really like this and the delivery was fast. This was a great find and buy."
77813,This show has lots of action and the drama is not to much.  The story keeps you on your toes.
77814,The acting and the story line was excellent.  It provides many hours of entertainment.  We highly recommend this outstanding series.
77815,"DO NOT WAX OR POLISH YOUR CAR WITHOUT DOING THIS FIRST!  I was APPALLED at how much grit my clear coat was holding on to.  Ever walk through tall weeds and get burrs on your jeans?  That's what your clear coat does with dirt, brake dust, and other nasty grime that actually sticks to your car & SOAP & WATER CAN'T WASH OFF!After washing and drying your car, take a small amount of the clay (enough to fit in your palm, knead it so it's warm, and make it flat, about the size of the thickness of a pencil & large enough to fit flat on your palm).  Spray a small amount of the lubricant (that's what that stuff is meant for) and then gently without any pressure slide the clay along where you sprayed.  At first the clay will grab and you can feel it getting caught.  This is the clay actually sticking to the stuff on your paint & as you move the clay back and forth & around, you'll feel it starting to glide with zero interference or effort.  Now, take the clay off the car and look at it.  See the black stuff?  That was IN your clear coat!  Simply fold the clay a couple times and then flatten it back out to the size of your palm again.  And now with your finger, feel where you just clayed, and then move your finger to the next spot you're about to clay.  See?  Repeat until you do your entire car.  Should take maybe an hour at the most.Now it's time to wax/polish your car.  If you have a random orbital polishing system, use it now.  Your clear coat will be smooth as glass, and it's NEVER felt that smooth.Quite honestly, this took a 10 year old (what I felt was well taken care of) paint and made it glass smooth.  Feels like a show car now!"
77816,I like the whole process of screening a chef and have learned so much about the restaurant business. I also like Ann in this series. She is more of a mentor and coach and seems to care about the chefs as well as the owners. She shows a tad bit of softness which I like.
77817,The writing is excellent and borders on unbelievable unless you have been part of a dysfunctional family.  This group definitely put the FUN in dysfunctional and the actors are perfectly cast and do a wonderful job with the dialogue and situational comedy/drama scenes.
77818,"Just installed these and it was a breeze. I put one in and compared with stock and it was noticeably whiter and maybe even a tad brighter (then again that could be due to the whiter color).These are a good in-between from OEM halogen and those third-party HIDs. The third-party HIDs are no good as they blind oncoming traffic. So for the price, these are worth it to me.Now we'll see how long these last, but the first install and test looks good."
77819,When I first saw this show I was like nope. After watching it a couple more times I saw the good message it sent & my daughter loves to dance & sing a long!
77820,"I have been watching this feeder for a few days now. The birds land on the feeder, take one beak bite out of the feeder then hop off and repeat. So the birds are using it but it seems to be slow going for them."
77821,"I've enjoyed previous seasons of Bones more than this current season, although it's still a very good show.  I definitely prefer watching it week-by-week on Amazon Instant over waiting for it to show up on the network's website or on Netflix."
77822,"mobil has the best researchers in the world designing their gas,oil and filters.....more than 50% of the NASCAR racing cars use mobil 1.....if you have the time and research oil and filters you will see that mobil will always be on the top...a few may be as good....but none are better....wait for sales....but always buy the best for your car....anything cheap will always cost you more in the end.....cheap gas has no additives and leaves your engine dirty....mobil gas has detergents that keep your engine clean....its in the tier 1 group which is the best available....for gas,oil and filters stay with mobil and your car will thank you for it......joey"
77823,"This filter is 1"" thick so you don't need stones or gravel in the bottom.But it won't be making your flower pots much lighterunless you stack several on top of each other ~which is exactly what the instructions say to do.This 9 1/2"" x 1"" diameter disc is just that,and not a 'roll' as it is also referred to in the product discription.This product is handy for less dirt loss out the bottom.The appropriate size round disc will cover the entire bottom of a pot.Therefore covering all drainage holes no matter how random.And drainage ability is greatly improvedover the broken flower pot pieces I now use.The disc can be used in flower pots in doors or out.They can be rinsed and reused.A variety of sizes are available, small, large, and irregular.The disc can be easily cut with sissors for a custom fit."
77824,"I've had this now for a while. It is heavy duty, stays in place, well made, stays pretty clean, easy to take on and off, well designed, good-looking. I have it on a Weber Summit."
77825,"As someone who remembers the original Dallas, this reboot is fun, sexy, soapy and just the right amount of shirtless guys.  This is primetime soap at its best."
77826,"I've been using the &#34;humane&#34; traps for a while now, but recently the mice have somehow found a way to claw out of the lid.  Finally got fed up and got these instead.  Worked overnight, quick, easy, and painless.  You don't see the gory mess afterwards because the lid automatically pops up after a catch, at most you'll see a tail."
77827,"This is an excellent product, and it does exactly what it says it does.  It gently buffs out those irritating swirls that somehow develop over time in the finish of every car.  I use a Porter Cable 7424XP buffer, and it makes for a great combination.  I've recently started using more and more Meguiar's products,and I haven't been disappointed."
77828,"Was concerned the door would slam based upon the other reviews so just mounted the one spring.  If you open the door all the way, i.e., right up to the outside wall it won't pull it shut unless you give it a little nudge back but opening halfway it gently closes the door.  Installation was straightforward and easy and I am not particularly a good instruction interpreter."
77829,"You cannot use the entire container. It states you can, but if you do, the lower third of the container will be full of seeds that either won't sprout or barely sprout at all. That makes for a container full of seeds, some having sprouted and some that haven't. If you dump the whole lot into a tray, then when it's time to harvest, you'll have that bottom third not ready to harvest. It's wasted unless you wait for it to catch up.In order to use this container properly, you can really only put one cap full into it. One and a half will fill it up once most of them have sprouted, but it will leave about a 1/3 unsprouted. If you put that much, something happens, either due to improper drainage, air flow, or pressure from the weight of the seeds above, that makes the bottom third of the container non-sprout.If I had to guess why, I'd say it's due to airflow being blocked (too many seeds in a vertical column).Aside from this, I also use a cylindrical glass container combined with a 6"" or so bowl-shaped strainer. It's just as easy as this thing is, but you're just left to rinse off the strainer. Just press the curved side of strainer into the top of the opening, tilt, hold strainer to the opening, and let it drain. It can even be flipped completely upside down. It isn't perfect, but neither is this thing. I find they both work the same, and at least with the glass container, I can flip the entire container upside down since it's larger and have the seeds at the bottom get moved around. You can't do that with this difficult sprouter because the container is small; the seeds can't be shaken and mixed up as well once they start sprouting."
77830,"The characters are interesting, and so is the back story.  We still have much to learn about the world of Defiance, and I'm looking forward to the next season.  This is a very entertaining show!"
77831,My daughter can't get enough of H2O. She loves the show an it is family friendly. It seems to keep her attention and I don't have to monitor it for bad issues.
77832,I don't watch this series but my son purchased this so he could pass time on the airplane.  This was a win-win for both of us.  He kept from getting bored and I got to finish some work while he watched the video.
77833,"Serial horror with standard horror conventions is a new product for American television and in the last year we have gotten American Horror Story and now the intriguing show The River. The River has an interesting premise that has the potential to last for more than one season even if the first central mystery is solved.Dr. Emmett Cole is the host of a documentary reality show that seems vaguely anthropological in focus. Dr. Cole, his wife, his young son and his staff and crew spent the 1980's and 1990's touring the world in their boat, The Magus and exploring the cultures of the world. The past is shown in flashbacks that add to the story and break the tension in a good way. Every moment of Lincoln's childhood was spent chasing the magic and mystery of the world and before the artfully hidden cameras. Lincoln of course rebelled and his mother and father had the usual marital problems when one partner has obsessions the other partner only partially shares. Thus, Dr. Emmett Cole has taken one last trip into the Amazon alone to seek the magic and sorcery of the indigenous peoples of South America and ultimately spiritual enlightenment. Before this is done his family and friends may wish he had been attracted to a Buddhist monastary. And apparantly he finds that magic and it is all too real as he has disappeared leaving tapes with tantalizing glimpses of the magic he has discovered.Dr. Cole's wife is determined to find him and heal the rift between them, even though both of them have had affairs over the course of their marriage. She pushes her reluctant son Lincoln into accompanying her on the expedition because the network is funding it, but only if every moment of fear, anxiety and family discord can be caught on camera. And of course the long-time crew is just as much a part of the story as the family, especially in light of the fact that Dr. Cole's first companion on the quest is dead and his is the first ghost the party encounters. Filled with standard horror tropes and the magical realism of South America (in one episode a spirit enters one of the characters via a dragonfly) and the drama between the nicely drawn characters. Another episode features an indigenous Stone Age tribe defending their territory. As a tribe recently appeared out of the jungle and started putting arrows in people in real life, this is more than believable.Three episodes in I recommend this to anyone who likes horror, adventure and mystery. I know I will be watching more episodes as they air. Well-written, filmed in an interesting style and incorporating elements not usually seen on American television this is worth investigating."
77834,"I enjoy watching Witches of East End, it's just a little different."
77835,"This was great. After using Mother's Clay Bar System, I applied this wax and it was as smooth as a baby's butt. Some other waxes that I have tried were much more difficult to apply and buff off."
77836,I was expecting more clay but I guess for the price it is okay. I have had to park my new car under trees and the paint has gotten all sorts of specs and things that appear to be imbedded in it. I hope this product works; I have not had the time to try it out yet but only expect the best from Meguiars.
77837,"""All great films, without exception, contain an important element of no reason.""  The movie opens up with a type of disclaimer about what you are about to see, summed up in the line, ""The film you are about to see is an homage to no reason"".  The audience then watches the tire (yes, the movie is about a tire) escape from the ground and start on its path of destruction.  To me this movie is a type of satire about ""Reality TV"" and the people who watch, complete with a full audience commenting on what they see.  I really had no idea what to expect with this one, and I was very, very surprised.  This is one of the funniest, most original movies I have ever seen.  This is a movie about a tire that is alive and has psycho-kinetic powers.  To explain more will ruin the experience you need while watching this.  Very surprising and hilarious.  This is a definate must see, but if you don't like the first 10 min you will probebly not enjoy the rest of the movie.  Go in with an open mind and you will love this as I did. Not being a fan of reality shows helps too, so you can get the subtle jabs and the irony.  I give it an A-.Would I watch again? - I would, but it would be better to watch with someone who hasn't seen it yet.*Also try - Honestly, there is nothing else like this, which is what makes it great."
77838,"I needed some more of the Speed Shine, but saw this and decided that I also needed some microfiber rags to go along with it. These rags are awesome feeling. Works really well with the speed shine to deliver a smooth, even finish."
77839,"Only had the need to use this tester a few times over the years but its holding up well, gives a nice stable reading, and comes with everything I have needed so far to get the job done."
77840,We use this in the vent above our bed and it works perfectly at keeping that early morning light from coming through the vent.
77841,"I absolutely adore this show. It's my kind of humor. It pokes silly fun at people from Portland, pretentious health concious hipsters, too hip for their own good.Ordering food in a restaurant becomes a five year trip to an organic chicken farm run by a charismatic cult leader who imbues every encounter with God-like love.The handsome goofy mayor is all over the place mentally, deciding to get together a baseball team for Portland which ends up with whatever pot luck players want to join, including an old man who is deaf, a very obese African-American, etc.The long haired proprietors of a bookstore carrying only books about women's issues are snobby space cadets, unable to make change without closing up shop and going to the bank.The title of the show is a combination of the words Portland and Utopia. In one episode, it is explained that Portland has never left the 1800s. Men have long beards and handlebar mustaches. People make their own beer. Bikes are the main transportation and they are uncomfortible ones. People raise their own chickens.Until I can arrange to visit this strange and funny place I can watch this, although there weren't enough episodes.I find this show a breath of fresh air. It's off the wall silly and I love it."
77842,"This is a apocalyptic movie about a strange virus that is destroying the senses of humans one by one. However, humans quickly adapt and move on with their everyday life.Eva Green is absolutely fantastic (as a statistician working in an hospital) in her role like in all movies that she appeared (Cracks is my favorite for the moment). I wish she would appear in more movies.While many people may not like the movie, from a scientific point it makes sense that a virus can and may be one day infect a particular cell population in the brain that is responsible for our senses.We have officially five senses: Sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. It is quite amazing how the movie demonstrates the adaptability of humans. Once a sense disappears, after a few weeks of panic, people adapt and move on with their life. That is probably the best part of the movie, beside the love story between Eva Green and Ewan McGregor.The movie is well done and while it is focusing on the two love birds, we get the message of adaptability.Without being a spoiler, four of the senses disappear during the movie and the one not gone by the time the movie is over (touch) is the most intriguing of all. Once I got into the movie, I was expecting to see what would be the consequences of losing the touch feeling. We will never know since the movie doesn't tell us but we can guess many different scenarios.Great movie, five stars all around for everything!"
77843,"Bought this as a gift for hubby and he absolutely loves it.  Made great points with this purchase.  It was easy to put together and the first time out he smoked a turkey.  All I can say in YUMMY!  What a different between a smoked turkey and a baked one.  We will never go back.  Since we live in California, we can use our smoker all the time."
77844,"""Crime in this city has become an embarrasement.""  After getting off a train in ""Hope Town"", the Hobo (Hauer) thinks he has found a new start.  What he found is a city bathed in crime and trash the likes of which the world has never seen.  After finally hitting his breaking point he decides to clean up the town, with a shotgun.  The next movie in the ""Grindhouse"" series.  If you have seen the others or are familiar with the old style ""Grindhouse"" movies you will know what to expect.  If you are are unaware of what this is you will be shocked beyond repair.  This is not a movie for everyone, if you are at all queasy or easily offended then you should avoid this movie at all costs.  For those that know what this type of movie is you still may be shocked.  A lot of the way you feel about movies has to do with your expectations going in.  If you have low expectations even a bad movie can seem good.  That is what this was to me.  After watching ""Machete"" my theory was that this will suck.  This is by no means an Oscar type movie, or even a good movie for that matter, but it was much better then I expected.  Like the other ""Grindhouse"" movies this one is very, very over the top in terms of gore and violence.  The one thing this had that the other three didn't is that this one tried to be more serious.  While there is definate cheese in this, it didn't try to be something it's not.  Overall, the only thing I can really say about this is that this movie is exactaly what you would expect from a movie called ""Hobo with a shotgun"".  I give it a C.Would I watch again? - I don't think I will*Also try - Machete & Death Proof"
77845,"These little mirrors are real life savers, but this one could be a good 30% bigger, and one of them was immediately scraped off in the car wash, so a stronger glue is also needed."
77846,Always looking for a new episode to watch during the TV dog days of summer. Can't get enough of these history lessons.
77847,"Here we watch the master of serial killers weaving his way through the lives of FBI profilers, agents, doctors, law enforcement specialists, troubled victims, and other active or potential serial killers.  A master of disguise and manipulation up to his own nefarious plans, feeding his own bloody desires, and puppeteering the weak-minded and the innocent.Let me promise you this:  Hannibal's plans are interesting.  His deeds are dark and exciting.  His deft handling of people is inspiring.  His opponents are just as intelligent, but not as crafty.  Also . . . and most troubling . . . his meals are surprisingly mouth-watering.You've been warned.  This show will sweep you up into its arms and mesmerize you.  It is twisted, bloody, macabre and intelligent, clever, and thrilling.The characters are each unique, unpredictable, and brought to life by the best of actors.  They each have their own personal troubles to augment the main storyline of each show and the over-arching storyline of Hannibal's manipulation.Not only is this series a homage to Hannibal, but it is an evolution of Thomas Harris' beloved characters.  This series can go on in many transmutations for years as long as it pits the troubled minds of Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter against each other.This is one of greatest dark stories on television.  Move over Dexter.  This is serial killing brought to a whole new level.Thrilling and full of twists.  Nobody gets out of this series unaffected, unharmed.  Even Hannibal himself!Good stuff!  WATCH or BUY it NOW."
77848,"What it does:The Havahart Spray Away Elite II is designed to scare off critters that come to eat your garden vegetables. It does this by spraying a jet of water to startle the creature. When a creature ventures into the field of view of Spray Aways sensor, it activates and fires a jet of water. The intensity is similar to a garden hose with a nozzle being turned on at about 75% of full blast for about 5 seconds. The water jet sweeps a few degrees and makes a startling noise. Spray Away does not directly target and shoot water at animals (unless it gets lucky). It detects heat and motion at a distance of 30 feet from the front of the unit. It covers a 180 degree angle. It can't detect animals coming from directly behind it. The solar powered battery can fire about 5 times a day. There's no need to hook up a hose like some other similar models. It has 2 led lights which flash when water is low or the charge is low. The LED lights are not bright, but are visible even in bright daylight. Maintenance is rather minimal, only requiring twice a week water fill up (but this depends on how many animals cross its path) and wiping the solar panel and detector surfaces clean. Fit and finish quality are high.Set-up:I found the set up very easy. You fill the tank with 3.5 gallons of water. Choose the sensitivity from a dial and turn the unit on. The sensitivity setting is not well defined in the instructions, but I assume it's based on the size of the animal you are attempting to deter (contact with the company confirms that the settings are based on animal size, 9 being most sensitive for small animals). Strangely, instructions do not tell you exactly what a 'large' or 'small' animal is in terms of measurements. The higher the sensitivity setting the smaller the animal the unit will detect. A very high sensitivity may produce false activations. For example, a tree limb moving in the field of view or a butterfly might cause the unit to spray. Therefore, you may need to lower the sensitivity a bit or move the unit to a different location. I have mine set on 8 out of 9 to deter pesky rabbits. I have not experienced any false alarms.  You can adjust the spray jet to travel about a maximum of 25 feet. The spray head also rotates during squirting so that the jet of water is always firing somewhere different. This keeps the unit from becoming predictable to animals and losing its effectiveness.Conclusion:My only major complaints are the instructions and the indicator lights. The manual says to set the sensitivity values based on ""small"", ""medium"" and ""large"". Large what? I assume animals? How big? Not sure. The indicator lights are positioned on the front of the unit. If you forget to turn off the unit and try to read the LED lights, you will get hit with a jet of cold water. Also, the top of the sprayer is a place where birds like to roost and, of course, poop. The poop lands on the solar panels. Hopefully, on the next re-design of this product, the Havahart engineers will make that roosting spot a little pointy so that birds will avoid sitting there.So far Spray-Away has been very effective. Rabbits devouring spinach and lettuce were our problem last season. I have not seen one rabbit (or any other varmint) in our 25' x 30' garden area since placing the unit on the perimeter. They actually seem to be avoiding the garden. We left some ""bait lettuce"" in the garden for a few days as a test and so far it is completely uneaten. I have had no problems with inadequate charging of the battery. It always seems ready to work.I think the Spray-Away is worth the extra expense. It's actually fun to use and is a much better alternative to applying chemical deterrents (especially in an edible garden). If you have a huge garden, you will probably need additional Spray Aways and of course, this could be costly. Also, if you expect many animals to be crossing through your garden, you may want to get the version with attached hose, as you don't want to have to fill up the unit with water constantly, but remember that animals will eventually learn to avoid the Spray Away's path and therefore, it should spray less and less.I highly recommend this product if you have a garden munching animal problem and a little extra money to spend."
77849,"The premise, a couple of future slackers become unwilling minions of the evil galactic conglomerate, is so clich&eacute;, so uber-PC, so lefty Hollywood snarky inside-joke stupid it might have been funny. Except that the jokes fall flat or are flat out distasteful (""I'll get you a hooker with five vaginas""). For heroes we have a fat, dorky stoner and his friend, an even more pathetic, down on his luck looser who is looking for love. Hilarity does not ensue. The highlight of the episode, and the stand-out in the cast, is the rebel chick. Unfortunately she comes with a stereotypical self-absorbed, narcissistic pretty boy sidekick--a total poser who loves to get stoned and quote Chairman Mao. Instead of being witty Dark Minions is banal; instead of being edgy it is foul mouthed; instead of being good it is simply bad. What makes shows like Big Bang Theory geeky and good is they have real science jokes and plot devices, matched with sympathetic characters possessing depth and believability. This pilot has none of those characteristics."
77850,"It's great to go on a vacation or a long drive and have something which I can easily use to recharge my digital camera, android pad, Nintendo, iPod, and plethora of other small electronic devices while on the road and in the car.  This worked great!  I love that I can plug something into it that has regular household prongs and that it has a USB adapter for charging the small electronics.  I would not plug anything that requires much voltage such as blow dryer or space heater, but for a small radio, cell phone charger or light, it works nicely!  And it tilts so that if you need to adjust it somewhat you can do that.I now keep one in each car.  Really nice to have if you need to charge something along the way."
77851,revenge season 3 definitely out ranks season 2 you are on the edge of your chair with every episode. wow
77852,"Loads of funny bits, great acting good story and character development. Can't wait to see what happens next. Love the phone wife!"
77853,"Steve and Danno make it worth watching, and Steve with others helps.  Kono and Chin are the best, and deliver the most feeling and believability.  Writers need to give better material to them, but yes, I realize it's prob not their decision."
77854,"Here in Las Vegas we have a great number of hummingbirds, these feeders have been very popular with the birds."
77855,I'm not at all sure there is anything better than an exclusive tour of other people's filth. THAT is entertainment!
77856,"Like the other reviewer, I use this for both automotive and general garage needs... I actually stumbled upon it sitting in my toolbox and had an air hose leak that was bugging me for a while because I am horrible with the sealant tape and applied a little bit and tightened everything down and no more hissing... A good idea is never overkill.  Can't go wrong with the permatex line-up, I use this and anti seize lube religiously."
77857,"Chick Flick Alert! No one can do them better than director Nick Cassevetes (""The Notebook"") when he's in the mood. Working with writer Melissa Stack in her first full-length project (I'll keep an eye out for this talented gal), this pair knows how to deliver a punch straight to where we live. This guilty pleasure is a perfect showcase for the hilarious Leslie Mann and the fearless Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (in a wild departure from ""Game of Thrones""), but the others are laugh-out-loud funny, too.Being a successful lady killer can have its perils when the ladies involved are:* Cameron Diaz (""Bad Teacher"") as Carly, as successful attorney betrayed by her lover...* Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (""Headhunters"") Mark, who is the irresistibly handsome Lothario married to...* Leslie Mann (""This is 40"") Kate. After an initial rough patch, the wife and the mistress quickly discover that he is also courting...* Kate Upton (""Tower Heist"") Amber, who feels betrayed when a fourth woman is spotted being seduced by this three-timer.* Nicki Minaj (""Ice Age"" voice) is Lydia, the brassy secretary who tells Carly that ""liars live longer.""* Don Johnson (""Machete"") is Carly's proud father, often married, rarely sorry.It is clear that we are in good hands when the movie opens with a gorgeous aerial shot of New York City and Etta James singing ""I Want a Sunday Kind of Love."" ...sigh...Rated PG-13, you will see no nudity and hear no profanity, but there are several segments where the women get drunk together. I have never seen such terrific physical comedy that features women! I'll buy the DVD from Amazon as soon as it's available because I know there were whole chunks of the witty dialogue that got by me."
77858,"This is part of the pilots that are being tested. This one was decent for a first try, I am not sure how much I would be interested in watching it if it became a series, but I would not totally be opposed to trying it out."
77859,"I love this show. This episode had a pretty convoluted plot. Can't wait to see what happens to Artie and perhaps all the rest of them, next."
77860,"The characters were fun and had their various flaws. I hate that this show was cancelled before the writers could explore the flaws. Although the show seemed written around Renner/Tamblyn as the primary cop-couple, each cop-couple seemed pretty interesting and there was a lot to explore in their various relationships.In the end, I think my favorite character was going to be the recurring character of Marvin. The two episodes that he was in were fun and he was great as a sympathetic criminal. Too bad this show didn't get a chance to develop. Dumb decision makers!"
77861,"I gained +positive performance, after changing my stock tires of my 2012 4x4 ford expedition from Pirelli 255/70/R18 to Michelin 275/65/R18, the car went a bit slower than before, but after I installed this filter it seems my car received more air ratio. Much better shift firmness. I am so happy and thinking to buy more stuff from K&N"
77862,"Love that it is a continuation of &#34;The Closer.&#34;  I like everything about the show, hope it stays on years!!"
77863,"I don't watch such graphic shows as a rule.  Got hooked in the beginning.  Now I have to see it through.  The acting is outstanding; the story-line intriguing. Again, one needs to start at the beginning or be forever lost in the tangle of Harlan County, Kentucky."
77864,"The video quality was very good.We had watched season one, but then the satellite company and AMC had a falling out so we missed the second season.We were happy to find it on Amazon and we got it through Amazon Prime."
77865,"Come on, I have lived in British Columbia and knew some real mountain men... these guys are NOT. Real mountain men do not have airplanes, snowmobiles, sawmills, cars or handy neighbors just to name a few things.Then on top of that the show tries to make it seem like these guys are &#34;lost&#34; or in danger when it's so obvious there is a camera crew with (for one example) stage lighting making it much easier to fix the broken snowmobile in what should be darkness. How dumb. Are we not supposed to notice that or are we supposed to think the whole crew was in such peril?On top of that, it's almost as if there wasn't enough dialogue to fill up the time slot with the same dialogue being repeated over and over ad nauseum.This must be one of the worst put together series I ever saw on TV (or in my case the Internet). I found myself watching more than just a few minutes of the first episode because I couldn't believe how poorly done it is.I could make a camping video with more realistic danger than this show."
77866,"I bought these for a set of Work Meister S1 wheels and so far like them.  The lugs are impressively small and have a snug fitting key adapter.  I have used a number of lugs before and these are probably the smallest I have seen.  The diameter of the the outside of the lug (with the key on) is no bigger than the diameter of the 60 degree lug seat.  This means it should theoretically fit in even the tightest tolerance wheels.These are spline drive lugs, so a standard lug wrench won't get them off.  This likely provides a small degree of security by itself, though for expensive wheels I would recommend a good set of locks.  I picked up theGorilla Automotive 71631NBC Acorn Black Chrome Wheel Locks (12mm x 1.50"" Thread Size), Pack of 4.  The finish will likely hold up well over time.  This is due to the nature of the finish itself and the fact that the key fits very precisely and will not slip across the splines.  I find that one of the main reasons regular hex lugs get scratched is ill-fitting wrenches which slip and slide across the surface of the lug.  You will get none of that with these lugs.The key for the lugs has a section for a 3/4"" wrench and one for a 13/16"" wrench.  I would suggest using the 13/16"" since it is closer to the middle of the key, and is a larger diameter.  This will put less stress on the key itself, reducing wear over time.Overall a very well designed set of lugs for tuner wheels."
77867,"Great charactors to &#34;watch out for&#34; in this story.  At one point I truly could barely wait to see the following week.  But, overall it is very entertaining and good for temporary escape"
77868,This show gets better each season.  I'm so glad that this was available online since my DVR is usually pretty busy!
77869,the foam ball prevents wind pop and it also doesn't get smelly like some other foam would be. i would highly recommend it.
77870,"This product will do what is says it will do.  That being said, it does not inspire confidence in heavy use situations.  It does not appear very rugged.  Nice that it comes with the mount, but again the mount is very thin and light and probably won't last very long.  Also, the wire coloring does not match with the standard US codes.  White is ground on the item, while in most cases in the US, black is the ground wire.  Where was this thing made?  Again, it is a good price, and a useful product, but just beware it might be very rugged or reliable.  Make sure to read the enclosed documentation so that you match your wiring correctly."
77871,"this is the perfect amp for bed practice! i just plug near to me and practice when i like to practice, no heavy amps to move just plug and chill , not a great sound but is for practice not for concerts!nice item good purchase"
77872,"We have experienced both squirrels and rabbits in our yard last season, and I picked this up to prevent the same from happening this season.What impressed me is this is not poison to pets, since we have three small chihuahuas and two cats who are at risk in our yard. Instead, it uses egg to make it smell like something dead, and capsaisin to make it taste awful. So when you spray it, it is safe to spray directly on the plants that you are using in your garden.In fact, this is approved by the OMRI as an organic product, so it can be used safely!The sprayer is a bit cumbersome, but it is still a lot easier to use than a simple spray bottle and allows it to be sprayed over a larger area. This larger bottle covers up to 1000 square feet, and will more than cover my anticipated garden area for this spring."
77873,"I have not purchased more as I have not had time to veiw. But if the others are as well done, I am sure I will like those as well. Will keep rating up to date as I go.."
77874,Season 4 continues the saga that is warehouse 13. It's a fun show and if you've made it to season 4..nothing in this review will persuade you one way or the other.
77875,"The information on this product states that this item it will fit most RV's.  Not so, not even close.  There is no way to even motifiy this item to make it work.  Was a total waste of money.  I've had RV's for over 40+ years, and have never even seen a gutter even close to what this will fit.  Not even worth sending back due to the shipping return charges being more that this product cost.  Would not recommend this product to anyone. To bad you have even give it one star, in order to leave a review"
77876,"I had two Delco batteries die after  four year period of five years in my low mileage Corvette.The battery fits perfect and the red top looks great in my red Corvette.The car turns over faster than it ever did,even after sitting for a few weeks.I hope that it lasts more than a few years.If it does not,I will add to the review."
77877,This guitar strap is very  comfortable and was easy to fit onto my electric Yamaha guitar.Very durable and affordable.My only gripe is that the color doesnt match my guitar as well as i thought it would.Colors are abit too flashy.
77878,"Might have been fun for them to make, but I couldn't sit through more than 15 minutes of it. Indie bad."
77879,"Perfection, NV: A tiny western town of dust, sand... and giant carnivorous graboids burrowing underground.And after three movies of battling the graboids, shriekers and ass-blasters, fans of the ""Tremors"" series finally got a (tragically short-lived) TV spinoff. ""Tremors: The Complete Series"" takes everything fun about the movies tacks in some conspiracies and freaky mutants -- there are a few mildly grating characters, but it's still deliciously fun and strange.A new guy named Tyler Reed (Victor Browne) rolls into Perfection, intending to take over the Desert Jack Graboid Tours... just in time for El Blanco to go on a berserk feeding frenzy.It isn't the last graboid-related problem -- Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) and the other Perfectionites must deal with a gourmet assblaster, a scientist training shriekers to be rescue animals, a graboid attacking a town of UFO-fanatics, graboid-rights activists who claim the Perfectionites are killing El Blanco, and a pair of mob thugs who run afoul of El Blanco and lost a very important key.And pretty soon there are even worse problems. Burt finds that a strange substance called MixMaster, leaked out of a secret laboratory, begins to infect the valley and turns the creatures into bizarre hybrids -- giant shrimps, omnivorous termite/maggots, a mineshaft ""ghost,"" or an acid-spitting reptilian plant.""Tremors: The Complete Series"" was cancelled after only thirteen episodes, but those episodes are brilliant from beginning to end. And they have everything you'd expect from a Tremors series -- lots of big guns, explosions, orange goop, and highly imaginative ways to kill various monsters (including with weather balloons and tar).For the record: the MixMaster, the secret lab and the eccentric old scientist all seem rather hokey, but soon they mesh nicely into the existing ""Tremors"" mythology. Think a funnier, lighter ""X-Files"" vibe. And the writers do an excellent job, weaving clever plots with plenty of action, a bit of tragedy (Cletus and Project 4-12), and lots of hilarious dry humor, especially regarding Burt (""Somebody get up on the wrong side of the bunker today?"").Gross is, as always, brilliant as the endearing survivalist Burt -- he has to start a survival school, wrangle with a hard-headed government rep, and deal with a town of hostile UFO-fanatics. Browne is decent as the new ""everyman lead,"" and there are some solid supporting performances by Lela Lee, Marcia Strassman, Sarah Rafferty, and especially Christopher Lloyd as a wonderfully eccentric scientist-turned-desert-hermit.Two of the cast aren't quite as endearing -- J.D. Walsh's pushy ubernerd just ends up being annoying. And Gladys Jimenez's Rosalita is a fun character (an ex-showgirl with a shady history) but sometimes it feels like she's there to run around in filmy shirts.""Tremors: The Complete Series"" has a couple bumps in the road, but overall it's a brilliant spinoff to the classic B-movie series. A must-see... or if you're a graboid, a must-eat."
77880,"I have been using this Hummingbird feeder for the last few weeks and I love the design and the quality. I have total of four feeders in my backyard in the midst of flowering plants, and they are doing a pretty good job in attracting the Hummingbirds.This pretty feeder is large and holds about 32 oz of nectar; bigger than the other three I have. The metal base and five flower feeding ports give plenty of access to the nectar. This glass container has a wide mouth and working with this is simple and easy. Simply unscrew the bottle from the base and pour the nectar, and it is also very easy to clean. I have rated four stars for its design, quality and overall satisfaction."
77881,"I've been using a California car duster for 20 years. Once they get too dirty, they kind of just push dirt around instead of picking it up. I buy one of these about every 5 years or so, so it's a cheap investment and helps me keep dust off my cars so much easier. This is a MUST if you have a black car. Black looks great when it's clean, but once it gets dirty (like 2 mins after cleaning) it looks horrible."
77882,"These wipers come with four different types of adapters which should make them compatible with most car makes.My car uses the most common type of adapter, the J-hook.  I have always gotten blades that have an obvious hook on them and have snapped them on without even having to think about it.These required several minutes of me having to think about which adapter to use, although the pictures showing each type of adapter on the inside of the cover was pretty straightforward.It took me several minutes of struggle to get the adapter for the hook type mechanism to fit securely onto the blade.  At first I had simply put the adapter into the connecting place on the blade, but it clearly wasn't secured and would simply lift right off.  After a few minutes of puzzling over the installation picture, then trying different things on the adapter, I finally was able to get it to snap securely onto the blade.The adapter seems a bit big and bulky.  It's a minor point but still, it is definitely bigger than other wipers have.Right after I installed these on my car we had a nice downpour here, our first in many months.  These performed flawlessly.I did not remove the little sticker that covers up the yellow wear indicator.I can tell when a wiper blade needs replacing easily enough and don't want a yellow reminder to look at.  Here we get so much sun glare year round that I replace wiper blades about once a year, and tires every two or three years, even though they still have plenty of tread, due to rubber rot.These seem about as good as the Bosch wiper blades they replaced, although not quite as simple to install due to having to attach an extra piece."
77883,Still have not blown out on me as other people keep saying. I can't help but wonder if they know not to touch the bulb itself.  It can be difficult to see improvement in a headlight on any regular night but I have found on wet and rainy nights these bulbs make a huge difference.
77884,"Worked great for us, nothing super special but nothing to complain about either. If you need one this will likely work just fine."
77885,This show is well done though at times I feel like going out to stand in the sun after watching it. The theme is dark and the lighting is often dark. Very well done.
77886,"I must say I was surprise with the first season ending and then with everyone getting their memory back, etc.  One of the best things about this show is that the pacing is just right.  For other shows it wouldn't be until the last season that you would get this much of a shift in the plot."
77887,These guys win! They are two of the funniest people on TV. It is worth watching every episode from every season.
77888,"Safer is a brand I trust.  I used this spray to battle aphids on pepper plants and a few other pests on other vegetables.It's more expensive than mixing your own solutions, but very convenient.Most of us who garden lack the luxury of time and it's often wiser to have a quick solution than waiting until you have time for a cheaper one.  Worked for me."
77889,"I've purchased the first couple episodes, but, there is no &#34;up&#34; in this show like there is in Pretty Little Liars. While taken from the same book series, this one is just gloomy, without interesting characters to perk it up. Heck, not even fun to just look at the ridiculous clothes like on Pretty Little Liars. I'll be waiting for the Netflix version."
77890,"Kit comes with literally everything you need to wash your car, and then some. I usually keep it relatively simple -(1) wash with soap and water(2) detail spray + claybar(3) waxThe only thing I bought in addition to this kit were these sponges (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GJ3FEC/ref=oh_details_o07_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1)Soap works great, and this is the same claybar I've used for years. Have yet to test out the ScratchX, and PlastX is actually recommended for clearing up foggy headlights!"
77891,"The cast is largely the same, that's good. But the whole movie just doesn't &#34;gel&#34; with the excitement and sparkle of the original TV series, the first two, anyway. There are flashes of the old character's great acting and it gets better as the movie progresses. But I was left disappointed, I'd expected more."
77892,"Two thousand years ago, northern Britain's native people, the Picts, rallied against the Romans.  In the northernmost outpost, a small garrison was massacred, except for second-in-command Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender).  He is rescued by the Roman's Ninth Legion, commanded by popular General Virilus.And then the Picts take on the Ninth Legion.So this is a sword. spear, and archery intensive, blood spattering (as in the300), chase, get caught, and escape type movie.The Romans, supposedly one of the most sophisticated and well-trained armies of the world, don't fare very well.  And why does escape seem to involve tramping over snow-covered mountain ridges, sensuThe Lord of the Rings?  Aren't there better ways to escape detection and get from point A to point B?There were just enough problems like this that made the plot irritating.  Be warned."
77893,Be sure to vacuum the carbon dust off first before installing or the black particles will get into everything. Otherwise it's a perfect fit.
77894,"I didn't expect much from this cover considering the price, but I was surprised at how cheaply made this cover is.  I broke two of the four straps that are used to secure the covers - they just pulled apart from the cover.  I do not recommend these covers since the fastening mechanisms are faulty."
77895,"i can watch this show forever, but will the rest come out in dvd/bluray soon? at all?police language is totally correct also!"
77896,guitar string 9.5 between 9 and 10.  Does its job for those who want strings that are easier to bend than 10 and not as noodlely as 9.
77897,This is such an easy way to check the wiring.  I used to use a voltmeter and this is so much simpler.  Highly recommended.
77898,"After reviewing people reviewer, I had no dout, It great and it sure was.  Snark has a GOOD TUNER for low price.  Thank to Amazon and Snark, I think anyone needs a tunersnark is the best for your money."
77899,"After watching the first 4 seasons of Chuck, I just HAD to get the last season as well - and it was money well spent. It was a little sad knowing the series end was coming, but the writers did a good job of keeping the action flowing right up to the end. All of the characters seemed to get their special moments during this season - the only character I missed was Anna from the early seasons.I don't want to spoil anyone's surprise, but we get a few visits and flashbacks to old characters, as well as a few new ones along the way. Most of the Chuck fans should be happy with the ending as well. Boy, it is ahrd to talk about this season without giving something away, so I will just summarize:If you watched the first four seasons, this season falls nicely in-line, but with a wrap-up in the final show instead of a cliff-hanger season ender."
77900,"i bought one, then i bought two more, then i bought two more.these things are well made (in the good ol' US of A), look good, and are a deal.  none of my guitars have fallen off of the wall, which is good, right?"
77901,These work great as low-wattage interior lights in my forest river R-pod (R-177).  I have one installed over the dinette and one installed  over my bed.  They are great for dry camping!  The color is very white-blue.  I use them as night lights when I'm only running in or out of the camper for a beer.  The one over the bed is very sufficient for a reading light.
77902,We missed this episode so bought it last night.  Didn't want to miss one!  Love the stars of the show!
77903,"During the early years of the cold war, I can see some of these thing going onand no one would have thought it was going on our streets of quiet Americabecause it all happened some where else and not here. Not so true nowwhen every one thinks anyone could be a trader or building or cooking somethingup that can kill. We are no long that place where bad things happen!!"
77904,I tried to give this pilot a chance just like I did with a few of the others and this one did something that the others did not...bored me from the beginning.  The show &#34;The After&#34; and &#34;The Rebels&#34; caught my attention from the very beginning while &#34;Gortimer Gibbon's Life on Normal Street&#34; lost me immediately.  The writing wasn't as great as the other shows and while Fionnula Flanagan is quaint as Miss Hudspith and Robyn Lively is more beautiful than ever the rest of the show has its flaws.  The children in the show don't have the ability to deliver the so called &#34;punchlines&#34; and there is just no chemistry.
77905,"One thing that I've noticed in looking at television reviews is that many people feel that if they watch a show, it automatically qualifies for a five star rave. I'm somewhat more pragmatic. I watch a variety of TV, not all of it is spectacularly good. In fact, I'd rate the shows I view regularly anywhere from 3 stars to 5 stars (I've even watched a few 2 or 1 star seasons when a program I liked dipped in quality). I'm mentioning this in preface to my comments about ""Primeval: New World"" because it's a show that I genuinely enjoyed as a lark. If you like dinosaurs, it's a bit of fun to pass the time. If you had the opportunity to watch it for free on SyFy (where it aired), I'd say ""go for it."" I'm a little more reticent about a full fledged DVD/Blu-ray purchase, however, because I'm not sure if you'd sit down to watch the series more than once. On the plus side: It's fun, lightweight, has an attractive cast, and some good dinosaur effects. Realistically, though, the monster of the week theme gets a bit repetitive. As the show tries to expand its mythology and intrigue later in the season, it does show signs of ramping up the drama to the next level. But just as things start to look more promising, the season comes to a close. And as the program was canceled, we'll never have the chance to see if the story lines would have deepened and gotten more rewarding.""Primeval: New World"" was a Canadian twist on the popular British series that ran for five seasons between 2008 and 2011. The original ""Primeval,"" which also struggled to find its initial footing, had a number of things going for it. In tone, it could be both exceedingly dark AND ridiculously goofy. The cast had a quirky energy and grooved together well, each playing a rather distinctive role. As the episodes progressed, the relationships and plot strands got progressively more twisted and complex and this kept things interesting. Not to be too harsh, but ""Primeval: New World"" is a decidedly blander affair in comparison. In this update, the dinosaurs are the stars and they are impressively rendered from episode to episode. Dinosaurs: FIVE STARS! The human storylines, however, are somewhat less interesting. Aside from the lead character (Eureka's Niall Matter), you don't get to know anyone with much depth. Sure, everyone is likable enough. And when things are kept at a breezy pace, this might be enough. But I really think that the show had the potential to be more impactful with its characterizations and plotting. The typical plot week after week is that when a dinosaur appeared, the crew faced it down and returned it home. This might be entertaining, but it certainly lacked imagination.Andrew Lee Potts (star of the original), as Connor Temple, makes a cameo at both the beginning and end of the series and it's great to see him. Matter plays a wealthy businessman/scientific researcher who has his life upended when his wife is killed by a dinosaur. Obsessed and driven, he has dedicated most of his time to tracking down where this beast came from and discovers a series of anomalies that create time portals to past eras. In each episode, as I mentioned, a new creature squares off against the Canadian backdrop to create havoc and worse. Matter's team is comprised of Sarah Canning, Danny Rahim, and Crystal Lowe. He also has a potential love interest in Miranda Frigon, and their on-going relationship is one of the more successful elements of the series. Also invaluable is Geoff Gustafson, an offbeat government official who may be an ally or he may be a foe. Of all the characters, it is Gustafson who remains the most mysterious, intriguing, and gets the best lines. Late in the season, a surprise appearance by Matter's Eureka co-star Colin Ferguson is also a big treat!Toward the end of the series, the dinosaur hunters are facing a more dire government conspiracy as well. I really liked this angle, but it still lacks some depth. In the end, ""Primeval: New World"" is not particularly ambitious on its own. If you like dinosaurs, this may be just the ticket. But if you're a fan of the original, I suspect you'll notice the more generic tone of this piece. I enjoyed watching these episodes, but it's not a series that I would revisit and/or remember as a new TV classic. Pleasant enough, though, at 3 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 8/13."
77906,"I am sure that there shows that are worse, have even more ridiculous clich&eacute;s, worse acting, cheaper display of endlessly insufferable stereotypes. Might it be that even worse writing is possible. I am very grateful that I have not seen it."
77907,"Real substance and content matter, with great acting.  What is there not to love? I'd love to see this quality content in a series. Pick it up, Amazon!"
77908,"They make a lot of assumptions regarding human history. We could have been eating wheat products all along, but only as it grew in the wild. They don't talk about eggs when they dismiss dairy. All animals eat eggs of birds when available, so did we. The biggest omission is the fact that we need fiber and whole grains to force the impacted feces from our bowel and large intestine. If you have an impacted large intestine or bowel, you can't eat green foods because when the decompose they also produce gas that is very painful if it is not passed quickly. I know this because, well, take a guess."
77909,"I don't think I've ever been so excited to get something in the mail! Could have been the super long and miserable winter, but I could not WAIT to get this set up. Luckily, setup was a breeze and required no tools whatsoever. Screw about six things in by hand, loop the hammock over the hooks and you're in business. In less than ten minutes, I was enjoying my first hammock ever!Some others mentioned an odor/smell, but I didn't notice anything. I set this up outdoors in about 70 degree weather and didn't notice anything and I'm highly sensitive to smells, esp that new plastic/manufacturing smell.I didn't have any struggles putting the pieces together, either. It was so easy to put together and I truly did appreciate not having to use any tools to screw anything into place.I logged about two hours in the 'mock today and I have to tell you, there's no uncomfortable position. I initially was a little skeptical that I'd like a hammock that was so wide (seeing the hammock 'burrito' pictures some others posted left me curious), but I've found that the wideness can sometimes provide some shade, too. There are so many ways to lie on this and it's just so cozy. I opted for the cotton hammock (color: tropical), and not the sunbrella fabric. The cotton is super soft and durable.I will take the cotton hammock part in the garage when not in use, but will leave the stand in the yard all summer.The hammock and stand seem very well-made. I had no hesitation about moving around in it and getting in and out. This hammock can accommodate up to 450 lbs. I had my boyfriend join me in the hammock, but it was kind-of cramped and, as he said, ""it's not my thing"". Pffft - more hammock for me!The hammock and stand come with a carrying case, too. I don't imagine I'll be transporting my hammock any where, but it does indeed break down easily and fits in a very nice little bag if you want to hammock somewhere else. Nice addition.So far, I'm very impressed! I'll update this review at the end of the season and note any flaws or issues, if applicable. For $130 (as of this writing), I'm very happy and look forward to wasting away the summer in this!"
77910,Love Shelby and S&S. Get kind of tired of the logging boys fighting all the time. Seems like they create accidents for the show.
77911,"In 2007, Shonda Rhimes (creator/executive producer of ""Grey's Anatomy"" and writer of ""The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement"") developed a spin-off of ""Grey's Anatomy"" titled ""Private Practice"" based on the life of Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh). For the most part, ""Private Practice"" Season One lasted about nine episodes and received a so/so reception from fans.For the second season, viewers were promised a much more exciting season and sure enough, Shondra Rhimes and crew were able to take the series to different heights this time around.The premise of the series is that Dr. Addison Montgomery has left Seattle Grace Hospital and moved to California to work for a private practice, Oceanside Wellness Center. In the first season, Dr. Addison Montgomery had to win the respect of her fellow doctors and relationships were examined in the first season.In the second season, Oceanside Wellness Center is not exactly in the best circumstances as the center faces major financial problems, a new rival practice trying to steal their clients, more relationship problems and drama, cross-over episodes with ""Grey's Anatomy"" and to cap things off, a dark and twisted season finale that viewers were probably not expecting.For the third season, ""Private Practice"" was all about personal challenges and taking things up a notch.  For Addison, we know that her promiscuity comes from her father and she knows she has to deal with it.  This season, she finds herself in more complication situations and also having to decide where she stands with Pete and Sam.Naomi is also put into an interesting situation as her move to another center tests her friendship with Addison but also her business/personal relationships with the men she works with.  But most of all, she's tested as a mother, with a teenager who is growing up.Violet and Pete must take on many challenges after Violet has suffered a major attack and now, not sure where she is in her life after the attack and having to give up her baby and making Pete a single father.  Cooper and Charlotte's relationship is tested and as volatile as a couple, they are also in love but have a difficult time showing it.This third season features episodes that deal with personal and emotional challenges, discovery, heartbreak and tragedy.VIDEO:""Private Practice - The Complete Third Season"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 169 televisions. Whereas ""Grey's Anatomy"" tends to be focused indoors, inside the hospital, ""Private Practice"" has a slick California look. Indoor scenes are well-lit and outdoor scenes are quite vibrant but viewers will notice the grain in the series. Even during the low-light scenes, you do see a bit of noise but compared to other drama series on television, the series is above average in terms of picture quality on DVD.AUDIO:As for audio, ""Private Practice - The Complete Third Season"" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Possibly with the exceptions of the final episode with the sirens and episode 41 (Blow Ups), the series is primarily dialogue driven, so it's pretty much front and center channel driven.The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Private Practice - The Complete Third Season"" includes the following special features:DISC 5:* Kate's Top 8 - (12:16) Kate Walsh talks about her top 8 favorite moments from season 3.  Featuring interviews with show creators and television crew.* Deleted Scenes - (8:10) Featuring 12 deleted scenes.* Bloopers - (4:27) ""Private Practice"" season 3 bloopersEXTRAS:""Private Practice - The Complete Third Season"" comes with a slipcase cover.JUDGMENT CALL:Oh Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers!  And the writers for both ""Private Practice"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" series...  You listened to the fans and what good you have done to improve ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Private Practice"" this last season.  And you should be commended for what you have done.Last year's ""Private Practice"" was going through an average season until things picked up towards the season finale which came out of nowhere.  But there had to be some improvements to this series.  The characters needed to be put in situations and challenges that they have never been before.It was one thing for Violet to deal with her violent attack and then leaving her baby behind, we got to see how things would develop between Violet and Pete, Cooper and Charlotte, the love triangle between Addison, Sam and Pete and to also see some development with Naomi and her relationship with Addison starting to deteriorate and then to see her find some love in her life.  But instead of becoming the usual ""Private Practice"" and characters sleeping with this character and that character, there were some deep storylines where the talents were given moments to shine.Kate Walsh did a fantastic job this season and she absolutely shined in episodes such as ""The Hard Part"" in which she gave such an emotional performance, Amy Brennerman also shined as the victim in the beginning of the season and also her return in the last episodes of the third season.  The writers did a great job in thrusting other characters in positions that they have never been in before.  Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, Audra McDonald were put into emotional situations and I really enjoyed the ups and downs between Adelstein's Cooper and Strickland's Charlotte.I felt another positive about this season is by bringing in new characters (like they did with ""Grey's Anatomy"").  There is only so much viewers can stand of Addison sleeping with this guy or that guy and Pete or Sam being with this woman and that woman, it's time that the series had new blood and the addition of Amelia Shepherd, William and Dr. Fife was very good.  Especially the potential of Amelia Shepherd, which would lead to crossover episodes with ""Grey's Anatomy"" that did not always involve Addison.And by the end of the season...as how Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers and the writers have shocked everyone with multiple tragedies in the sixth season finale of ""Grey's Anatomy"", the writers came up with a shocking finale in ""Private Practice"".Of course, there is only so much you can do with tragedy and this is not something that people will want to see every season finale but it was necessary as ""Private Practice"" needed to pull off a season finale that could best last year's shocking finale.  And the writers were successful.  But now we can only hope that they continue the solid writing for the fourth season.Overall, ""Private Practice - The Complete Third Season"" was the best season thus far.  The DVD contains a few special features and I wish there was more.  But the writing alone for this season was a major improvement and if you are a fan of this series, definitely give this DVD box set a chance!"
77912,"This type of trap is highly effective IF you do NOT follow the directions about how to place it. If you bury it (which the directions will tell you to do) it will simply NOT work. If your ""out o sight"" trap is out of sight it is TOO DEEP and all you will get is holes in your yard and perhaps an annoyed mole.When the very expensive exterminator (who we now refer to as ""Mark the Mole Man"") came to our house, I showed him our ""out of sight"" mole trap. He tried to be respectful but finally just said, ""Ma'am, that's too deep. Ain't gonna kill nothin'."" As it turns out, this is exactly the same type of trap he uses. He just knows how to use it correctly.He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles. He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills (please don't give PETA my address.) Finally he stopped, stood silently for a moment, then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil. Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel, and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.Then, artist that he was, Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil. Released the safety and - Done. He placed three more in the back yard (BIG yard) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.It was a wonderful (and for us expensive) experience. Go get your nasty little critter with this trap, but don't follow their directions. Listen to reviewer Geoffrey Klos."
77913,"For the most part, I enjoyed the first season of Lie to Me. Tim Roth is a fine actor, and very well cast as the protagonist, Dr. Lightman. He lends depth and intensity to a script that sometimes veers into the dangerous waters of daytime drama. The plots are uniformly interesting, and nicely paced.  The filming was crisp, and the directing was tight, which made up for the woeful mediocrity of the rest of the cast. (The one notable exception to an otherwise bland supporting cast being Mekhi Phifer who plays Agent Ben Reynolds.  But, you have to wait until the end of the first season for this much needed spice.)The real problem with Lie to Me is that, unlike Bones, there is very little science in the science. (And now I am going to speak as someone who has spent countless hours of doctoral research on cross-cultural nonverbal communication.) While the main ideas behind the psycholinguistics of deception are correct, some of the ""data"" presented in this show are completely misleading.  Somehow the writers, whether in their ignorance of the subtleties of the field, or in the interest of presenting something palatable to a general TV audience, have missed the basic point of psycholinguistics, which is that nonverbal and paralinguistic modes of communication are shared by all members of a given society.  In other words, we are all ""naturals."" Reading subtle facial cues (""body language"") is a vital part of what keeps society going. In fact, individuals who cannot read these subtle cues are diagnosable as autistic. (Asberger's Syndrome is a form of autism in which the individual cannot read nonverbal emotional cues.) So, there really isn't any magic in reading nonverbal cues.The other side of that coin is that we cannot correctly interpret nonverbal cues if we are not members of that society.  While it is true that there are some universal expressions (fear, surprise), the vast majority of facial cues are culture specific. Lying falls into that category. If a Mayan Indian smiles, nods and says ""yes"" after being told the world will end in 2012, he or she is NOT agreeing with you, but he or she is also not lying. (Nodding, smiling and saying ""yes"" are merely signs of politeness. If you asked that same person if he or she had murdered someone after breakfast that morning, you would receive exactly the same response.) The only thing a psycholinguist can accurately judge is whether a person from a given society is displaying discomfort or anxiety.  The cause of that discomfort is unknown, of course, and does not mean that the person is lying. (Which is why polygraphs are so notoriously unreliable. Telling the truth can make a person even more uncomfortable than lying.) In that light, I found the constant refrain of ""You're lying!"" to be not only irritating, but highly inaccurate. (There are also quite a few factual errors which not only reveal a profound ignorance of the legal system on the part of the writers, but an unwillingness to do simple research, both of which are inexcusable in the age of the internet.)In spite of the reservations I have about this show, I still found it fun to watch Tim Roth, if not much else."
77914,"Okay first, let me give a review that everyone gives 5 stars to.  This was great. The judges are funny and know their food.  Love the city and they changed things around.  that is it.  thank you and have a nice day.  You guys will give me a perfect review score now right?  i love these one liners that say nothing and get 5 stars.  This show is followed by those who are so bitter by the success of Gordon Ramsay who is on primetime, and carries an audience all over the world.  Top Chef?  Not even close in numbers, and for a reason. But for its channel and time slot, it does very well.  The last time i went into reasons why i liked it, I talked about the judges, the format, The obvious beautiful woman, and this season they have brought in more judges which means more personality, restored a career or two, and with the format changed once again I think it's great.  They brought back a few chefs that almost won in recent years, and they do a challenge against a real Top Chef.  It's fun all around. I like this show a lot. I am not in Love with it the way i am all of Gordon Ramsay's shows. However, I own all of Top Chef Seasons because i am a fan.  And they do seem to change things a little each season but not to much where you notice that the entire look is different.  i will leave it at that. It's good and fun to watch and a little different. That should be good enough for a 20 star review!!!!!  Right? lol Oh while im in here, one genius said all they do is fight on masterchef.  If anyone watches that show, and they do, you would know they compete, not argue.  In top chef, one person actually got thrown off the show for putting his hands on the other, and they all fight all the time. It gets a bit much actually.  Masterchef, they are nothig like that.  Also if Ramsay was not loved, lets look at the shows  he carries himself, Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, Ramsay's Kitchen Nighmares(British Version), The F Word,  Masterchef, Hotel Hell,  Gordons Great Escape, Ramsay Behind bars, Ramsay's Best Restaurants (British) and one more i am missing. So i think, and i could be wrong, im sure some idiot will have something to say, but Ramsay still owns the this type of show and more. Most famous, and I think second place in the world for most Stars for his actual restaurants.  He still finds time to study in othe countries to learn about their food and apply it here in the states. I would not even compare the two but it seems everyone else wants to. And its a shame. I think we can judge each show as an individual.  They are both very good and a lot of fun.  oh, don't forget to give me a 0 star rating. This actually had thought and facts....sorry?"
77915,"I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain, and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay."
77916,"This is a sweet guitar strap. I have a similar one but it has blue fire on it. These are very durable straps that won't fall off your guitar so you can play confidently. They are on the little bit of the stiff side where it can be kinda uncomfortable at times but it's expected since it's new. My blue fire strap from Dunlop is comfortable now since I've used it for awhile. So it's get better as you use it. Besides it being uncomfortable at first, it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :)"
77917,I just started smoking and not sure how you would do it without this. Sat in the house and waited for the alarm to ring to know I should attended the to the smoker.  Wires should come a little longer to accommodate further distance from the grill.
77918,"Wish I had gotten one a long time ago! I have an extensive patio garden with vegetables that need almost daily watering. I like to keep the area tidy, so coiling the hose back up each time is a must.  With traditional hoses it is a hassle every time! The hose kinks, wet dirt gets all over your clothes, etc... you know the drill if you use hoses a lot. But this hose is fantastic - flexible, lightweight even when filled with water, easy to stretch out to reach all ends of the large patio, and shrinks to almost nothing when the water faucet is turned off! And because it will shrink if you empty it after each use, scalding hot water does not come out when you first turn it on in 90degree weather like a traditional hose. I was concerned it may not be durable enough, but I have had no problems dragging it across cement, me and the dog stepping on it, and all day exposure to bright sunlight. This is the only hose I will use for now on!! It makes watering enjoyable again!I know some have had problems with durability. I have had this hose since 7/23/2013, so I will report on its durability in the future."
77919,"I've literally been smoking something every weekend!! I can't get enough of this thing. It's awesome!!! 6 stars!!! The 22.5&#34; is the way to go too. You may think that it's only a little bigger than the smaller 18&#34; one but those 4 inches makes a big difference when you put the two grates side by side. You can fit a ton of meat on here between the two grates. I did two pork butts on the top and 6 racks on ribs on the bottom. Like I said, plenty of room."
77920,". I was having an issue with a cheap adapter that was said to lower the pressure but did not have any meter or dial.  Here i can see the pressure and get what I feel safe with so my lines won't blow out.  I opened this item and  only tested it  and adjusted it to the pressure I want in my RV.  It seemed to work fine.  Then I put it away.  I expect to use it extensively my next trip and if it works better than I expected or worse, I will come back and amend my review then,"
77921,It was entertaining enough to keep me hooked throughout the movie. I love history so I watched the for the historical aspect of it. The movies accurate in it's portrayal of brutal times of the Roman conquest and of its losses in that conquest.
77922,I own a 2013 Camry SE. I do my own oil changes and other maintenance as much as I can to avoid going to the &#34;stealer.&#34; This filter works perfectly and changing the oil is pretty much a breeze. You will need the special wrench/ adapter.
77923,"The feeder comes with a powder that you mix with water so you can use it right out of the box if you have anything to use such as a rope or chain to hang it by.Unfortunately, the liquid that you have made by mixing the supplied nectar concentrate with water somehow leaks out.I thought maybe the wind blew it sideways so that the solution came out of the little sipping holes that look like flowers, but even after calm days and nights there was nothing left when I would go check on it.Where exactly the nectar solution comes out I haven't yet determined.I think maybe some birds other than humingbirds perch on it like they do power lines and it causes the feeder to tip and the liquid leaks out that way.Or maybe squirrels climb down on it and lap up the liquid as it comes out the sipping holes.I'm not sure.Maybe in a few days I'll be able to pinpoint what is going on.But for now I hate to but sadly have to give it a so-so review.  I really did look forward to watching the birds hang around it and enjoy a free meal."
77924,Inspector Morse never disappoints.  His story leads to the inevitable conclusion without tremendously distractin complications or superhuman feats of strength.  Lewis always plays his part as his sidekick and together they make an umbeatable team.
77925,"It had been a while since I had some EB's. Best packaging I have seen and for the price, don't order just one pack. Very pleased, always have a spare pair in your case."
77926,"These are really nice wiper blades, no streaking or catching up.  They were easy to install, just clip them on.Came with a good set of instructions, but we didn't need them.I would recommend these ANCO Contour Wiper Blades."
77927,Too much attention placed two male type major characters. I sick of them by the end of the season. Needed more plits
77928,"Intrigue and intensity, revelation of newer technology that I have not yet heard of, all of these things are reasons I like NCIS."
77929,"I really enjoyed this TV series, and I found it superior to season one.In season two, the relationship between Dr. Brennan and Booth is well developed, albeit unpredictable, especially with the newly introduced and sexy new boss. There are a lot of tensions, thrills, passions, conspiracies, and sex in this season. Some episodes were extremely well though-off and intriguing. I did like the most the episode on the astronaut. Are there aliens from outer space, and did one just fall down to Earth? Watch the episode to find out.This series will teach you a lot of medical terms as well as how crimes are committed (and how not to commit crimes)."
77930,I enjoyed watching the show but I did not like that it was left unfinished.  I will be very disappointed if they do not deliver another episode to provide closure.
77931,Works very well although I wish it had wider strapping or a choice of purchasing with a wider strap. Don't hesitate to purchase.
77932,I didnt end up using this because I actually forgot I had it. If I did remember this would have saved me so much time. I'll remember next time!
77933,These balanced patch cables are great.  This is the third set of various music cables I've purchased from this brand and they are all great quality for the price.  Love their XLR microphone cables too.
77934,This was a action packed first season was surprised that it was written by Steven King. Can't wait for the next season
77935,This is typical filler for those times when there is nothing else to present on TV. This is a standard soap opera with a few not to many quasi-sci-fi visions sprinkled in with no logic.Michelle Ryan is cute but there are a lot of cute actresses. I wish her luck in finding a vehicle with redeeming social value and not this mindless rehash of old plots.
77936,I like the science behind sci-fi and love to hear different theories so this is right down my alley. We don't have regular TV like cable or satellite so we watch Amazon Prime streaming on our PS3 and buy DVDs. Now we watch what we want when we want and don't filter a lot of crap to get to the good stuff!
77937,"These are what is factory on many imports. My 2002 crv had a spec for these. They are great and long lasting plugs. They do need to be gap checked but mine were all perfect at .040. The plugs are great but be sure to put anti seize on the threads, The factory plugs called for replacement at 110K, and they were hard to get out because they were a bit corroded in the head. They came out and got replaced mpg went up slightly. hope this review helps."
77938,"If you've watched House of Cards this is a similar D.C. political drama. However, where House of Cards sucks you in this show has you laughing.An enjoyable show that is fun to watch but not so gripping that it will have you binge watching until the sun comes up."
77939,"This filter can be replaced with relative ease IF you follow the included instructions. Since you'll save a ton of money by DYI instead of paying a dealer, the effort is certainly worth it."
77940,"The Energizer 120W Cup Inverter is a must for heavy travelers and those on the go.  I've used inverters before, but this is my first with USB ports.  It packs the power, the portability, and function that you would expect from Energizer.The cup shape is awesome.  If you have used an inverter before, you've likely had it sitting in your floor.  While this takes up the space of a cup holder, the ease and access to the ports makes it worthwhile.  You can plug up a laptop or tablet or several other gadgets into the AC power.  Or use one of the 4 USB ports.  If you travel with a laptop, tablet, GPS unit, phone, or countless other items, then this cup inverter will almost always come in handy for you.  If you have a laptop that requires more power you may wish to opt for another inverter.  Personally, my primary use is for all the USB ports, especially if you are travelling with multiple people as you can charge several phones at once.  The cigarette lighter cord has decent length and is certainly long enough to reach most lighters.Overall, a handy device that is great for travelling and to keep in your car for the unexpected need."
77941,"First of all, I love the Crybaby 535Q and I recommend this wah pedal. I will tell you my wah pedal story.Several years ago, I bought a Crybaby GCB-95 and, even though I did not use wah very much at the time, I think it was in the shop twice to get repaired within a year. Fortunately, it never gave out on me during a gig, but it was only a matter of time. Finally, I gave up and just stopped using wah pedals completely.A couple years ago, I bought a Digitech XP-100 whammy wah, mainly for the whammy effects to learn how to do Morello's style. Since it has some digital wah patches was available, I started to use them too and was happy because it doesn't have a treadle that will break like on my GCB-95. The wahs were usable, but just did not sound as good.Finally I was supposed to play Alice in Chains, ""Man in the Box"" and the Digitech was just not going to cut it. So, it was time to get a real wah. I searched around on YouTube for demos and talked to people to see what they used. I chose the 535Q because people told me that they've never had a maintenance problem with them, and it is very versatile.You can get several kinds of wah sounds by tweaking the dials,and they have some great suggestions in the manual to get started. I set mine on the Cantrell setting and have left it there because I mainly use the wah when playing early alternative 90s hard rock styles. That setting works will in songs like RATM, ""Bulls on Parade"" as well, including to create the white noise for scratch DJ sounds.I still do not use wah pedals terribly often, but it is nice to have a reliable wah that can do whatever I need it to by simply adjusting a couple knobs. I think that as long as I need a wah pedal, this one will suit my needs in many styles, and I think it will remain on my pedalboard for years! It is definitely one to consider, and the price is not that bad."
77942,"I have an issue paying someone $100 for them to plug in a gadget like this to read a code that tells me what could be wrong with my car.  At the same time, I hate the concept that I have to buy something like this to tell me what could possibly be wrong with my car.  That said, I'm glad that they sell this product.  Its great.It works on literally all 1996 and newer vehicles.  When your check engine light comes on, follow the instructions and plug this in.  It will read the code on the computer on your car that you can use to tell what could be wrong with your car.A few things:A) this is the base model of these types of products so you won't get some of the super advanced features of ODBII but it will give you the codeB) You can erase the code with this once you fix your car problemC) It doesn't require batteriesOf note, the codes are not perfect. They're only designed to help you troubleshoot and usually a code can have several root cause problems.  That said, its nice being able to plug this in and know if you have a problem that requires the car to be taken in or if its a $1.99 part that I can replace myself.I bought it because my check engine light came on.  Literally, the source of the problem was an unusual condition that sometimes occurs in cold weather -- no repairs were necessary to my Car...cost to diagnose: the cost of this scanner (which I get to keep for future use).Cost if I had taken it in....likely $100 for pluggin in the machine...AND an unscrupulous mechanic could have chosen from 4 parts to replace (the least expensive $1.99 and the most expensive about $200 + $200 in labor)....hmmm...This is a nice product.  Get it.  Save money."
77943,"The door catches I have installed are demonstrating corrosion pitting that I would expect to see from a chrome plated item, plus the catch is magnetic. The catch is either low quality stainless steel or chrome plated. I would recommend the plastic ones if you travel in wet and dirty environments, and especially if you travel in the winter."
77944,Call me a Sci Fi nut. I like this show and I enjoy being able to take it with me where I go.
77945,"While I haven't used a lot of capos in my playing, I have used 4 or 5 different types, and this is easily the best of that batch.While all capos require a certain amount of fiddling to get them to hold the strings down just right on each different guitar, this one was pretty easy to ""dial in."" I had very little trouble getting a position which gave good clear tones from each string without having to mess with tuning.The action of the grip and release mechanism is easy, but it delivers firm pressure to the strings. In fact, the only negative I found was that the height of the capo made it a bit difficult to fret near it on the higher strings on some chords.Overall, this is a very good capo, and I can recommend it without hesitation."
77946,"I got the 21&#34; and 19&#34; ACDelco Clear Vision Wiper Blade for the front windshield of my 2002 Subaru Forester. The printed instructions showed how to remove and replace the wiper blades for five different attachment types. My car had the &#34;Hook Lock&#34; type of attachment to the wiper arms. If you're not real familiar with your wiper blade attachment details, I highly recommend watching the installation videos on the ACDelco website or on this page. If you're outside with your car, you can take your smartphone and scan a QR code in the instructions with an app like QR Droid. There are several attachment adapters included for the different types of attachments. For the Hook Lock type used on my car, there was an adapter to slip on before attaching the blades, but the video makes it clear how to proceed.As best I can remember, these are the first frameless wiper blades that I've had, so I'll be watching closely to see how they perform. Snow and ice aren't much of a factor here, but we get about 50 inches of rain a year, and the summer heat is fierce, with a lot of UV from the sun. The acid test for any windshield wiper blades is how well they're performing six months or a year down the road. Regarding the indicator that changes color to alert you to change the wiper blades, I'm a bit skeptical about that. I change wipers when they stop performing satisfactorily, and I'll have to see if that coincides with the indicator.My initial impression of the ACDelco blades is very favorable, but I plan to update my review in a few months after seeing how well the wiper blades are performing then.Note: On the new wiper blade is an adhesive tab that says &#34;REMOVE.&#34; It wasn't obvious why, but I think that it was covering a piece that will change color when exposed to a certain amount of UV radiation, thus signaling that it's time to change the wiper."
77947,"It may be an odd way to start a review, but since it's the first impression (and it was a good one), I'll say that the carrying case on this unit is brilliant.  The shoulder strap, well-placed handle, and easy functioning zipper are all sturdy make transporting this portable paddock a snap.  Total weight is amazingly less than your standard camping tent.Set-up is also remarkably easy, even to the unitiated.  First timers might want to budget 30-45 minutes but after a time or two you should be able to secure the structure within 10-15 minutes (depending on your terrain).The fact that this operates on 2 ""D"" cell batteries is remarkable, making this kit truly portable.  The product description states it will operate for 30 days on those 2 ""D""s (amazing!).  I have not tested mine for nearly that long, but bringing a spare pair of batteries wouldn't be a hardship, I'm sure.I'd have some concerns about the integrity of this kit if you're trying to pen a ""spirited"" animal.  Make no mistake: this is no fence.  A more docile horse (or other animal) with electric fence training/experience will be safe and secure with this well-designed gear."
77948,"I did not like the movie, I am a horror movie junkie ( if there is such a thing). This  was not horror to me."
77949,Great show for kids!  I wouldn't watch it on a regular basis but think young kids would really enjoy this!  Funny and cute!
77950,"Story of a group of aspiring authors that get together to encourage one another and read each others work.  Then one gets an agent and a book deal while another goes the self publishing route.  Unfortunately, relationships suffer.  Painfully entertaining.See books by aspiring authors:Letters To My Imaginary WifeFlame-GirlThe ArrangementDon't Forget the Flippin' E: The Story of Tracey Tressler De LibroThe Adventures of the Human Cats: A Boy in Trouble"
77951,Works very well and is easy to work with. Make sure you use gloves because you will get splinters in your hands if you don't.
77952,"This is my favorite show to watch on Amazon these days.  My husband and I both love the characters, the new characters and all the plot twists and diverse people that police work encounters daily.  The writing is always so fascinating and so intriguing. It was sad to lose 2 detectives in this 8th season, but we are also loving their replacements."
77953,"Don't know why this show didn't last longer than it did, although....I am a Jeff Goldblum fan and I've found that most people are not. Liked the subtle humor, witty sarcasm, and character interaction.  The premise was unique and opened the show to a lot more episodes than it enjoyed. Too bad."
77954,"Purchased these glove to use when dumping my tank on my RV.  I was not very satifiedy with this product.  The problem that I had was that before you could get them on you hands the glove would come apart and either they would rip at the finger holes or just come apart putting them on.  They are very thin to use and I believe one size fits all. When I did use them I ended up using several gloves just to get the tanks emptied.I ended up buying a box of rubber gloves to use.  That were 100% better then these very thin gloves. Sorry, I would not recommend this product for dumping your tanks.."
77955,Tons of changes and surprises in this season! New characters and storylines! Great purchase! Excellent viewing quality on the kindle!
77956,"These strings are nickel which greatly reduces fret and saddle wear and they sound good.  If you are using stainless steel strings you are wearing those two critical guitar components down and they will eventually have to be replaced.  Saddles are easy to replace fret wire can be costly as that type of work is best left to the experts which with it comes an added cost to the player.\So I (and many others) play nickel.Bullet end?  If you are playing a Stratocaster with a tremolo bridge the bullets are designed to fit into the string receivers in the trem block and in effect add more mass to the tremolo block which adds and aids the transfer of tone to the guitar as a whole.Those two beneficial features alone convinced me to give these an honest try and over time (I've been using these for years) have proven to me to be the optimal string for the Stratocaster.These are durable.  Do they last?  Well, yes they do.  I rotate guitars on the gigs so I would say that if I was using the strat exclusively and playing it as much as I do through the week - I end up changing them out every 2 to 3 weeks and I'm playing 4 nights per week not including rehearsal or noodling around and I put them through a rigorous workout.What would that equate to  in hours?  Hmmm...  60 to 80 hours perhaps, maybe a bit more.  Add to that sweat, natural oils, oxidation, and that I don't use cleaners or chems on the strings, although I do wipe them down after a playing with a dry shop towel."
77957,"These strings are what I use on all  of my acoustic guitars.  The sound and tone are great, and the price is right.  They shipped quickly and I will order again and again."
77958,"If you read the book, nothing else needs to be said. This is a comic book in comparison. Really an insult to the fan of King. Let's pray they don't try to do 11-22-63 in this venue."
77959,"This show used to be about two guys, one a cocky attorney and one a genius pretending to be an attorney, and it was also about the interesting process of trying to survive as a rookie (with secrets) in a highly competitive law firm, a topic which had never really been explored before. And the writers did a good job, for a while. But - and this is what gave it moral weight - it was also about clients. Clients. That's right, real people, non-attorneys in danger from the law, who needed very good representation to win them justice.Then, as season 2 ground on, this show became only about the war-ing egos WITHIN the law firm, the jostling for power that the writers just make up the rules for as they go along - and it had so many twists and turns that no outcome was ever earned dramatically. It became like watching a bunch of smart alecks exchanging zingers - the equivalent of teenage boys in an alley saying, ""No,YOUR mother eats golf balls."" Or whatever. Gabriel Macht (Harvey) is a very watchable actor, but the writers no longer give his character anything that means more to him than his own vanity. Patrick J. Adams (Mike) is a very limited actor, and he can't convincingly play a hetero guy. He may be one, I don't know or care - but he can't PLAY one. Yet his story arc has degenerated into: ""But Rachel, don't you love me, now that we had completely unconvincing frantic sex in the law library?""We need stories that aren't just about a bunch of overinflated egos vying for dominance in a sterile corporate environment. Ultimately, the human ego is boring. We need stories. There aren't any."
77960,"Works well, arrived fast. No problems. Works as described. A good purchase for a low priced capo.Works for acoustic and electric"
77961,"I waS a bit skeptical of this kind of drama before watching, but found myself engrossed in the story very quickly.  The realism (albeit Hollywood style) gives a scary peek into the cold war with Russia at the time of Regan.  With news casts from the period it makes it seem even more realistic.  The show centers around the two KGB spies, husband and wife, who have been assisgned to America undercover.  Tension abounds with the interaction and difficulties with trust for each other and their &#34;keeper&#34; from Russia.  They are asked to do impossible information gathering that puts the tension on the cutting edge.  The acting is superb and the tension realistic between the two and at times you wonder if they really care of each other or not.  Heart pumping action, tension and excellent acting make this a real nail biter and couldn't help but watch the whole series in tow settings.  Well worth the time."
77962,Was very disappointed. We were looking for a series we could watch w our teens. Had too much offensive material to continue.
77963,Have one for all my toys plus a spare. Kept my tractor charged all winter and it started for every snowstorm. Kept it in the shed  and worked fine even below zero
77964,"I bought this kit to give me the parts to do tie rods and center link on an old MB diesel.  The kit was perfect and the tools were decent.  My main issue and reason for not given five stars is that this is not US-made.  Global economy or whatever, when I'm looking for quality tools, I'm not looking for products from overseas sold at top prices.  Sure, these are better than Harbor Freight, but I doubt the third world labor to make this was much higher than the HF part.But that is a rant to have another day, and I can point you towards a better kit for now.  So this is a great tool set for the DIY mechanic.. But I do hope that OTC brings manufacture to the USA."
77965,"Great price and well built, handle makes storage easy and the net has the standard PUSH BUTTON connector. This is a great buy."
77966,"I really like Epiphone products. They are well-made, easy to play guitars. I also purchased an Ep Les Paul Special 2 Ebony from Amazon a while back. But, I received this Uke defective. I expected when I plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but I couldn't here anything at all. Totally dead. There are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down. I'm disappointed because I expect Gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory. I actually bought this guitar for a friend and was very embarrassed when I got over to his house and it didn't work in front of him. I just requested a return/exchange from Amazon. If the next one works ok I may buy a second one for me. I seem to have bad luck with electric-acoustic guitars when purchased through Amazon. I had to send back my Dean 12 string elec-acoust to Amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem.  I do want to state that this is a beautiful Uke with nice feeling nylon strings, fine wood high polished surface, high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically.  The actual guitar looks even BETTER in person than in the picture. If this Uke was working 100% I would have given it a 4 or 5."
77967,This strap is very comfortable! Love how it just velcros right over my strap without having to remove it from guitar. It does slide around some and has to be adjusted every time I put it on but is so worth the final result.
77968,"I play bass in a lot of different environments, and I never know what to expect before I show up. If I am playing a venue where I can use my head and 4x12 combo I know I'll have great tone. If I am going direct into the board I am at the mercy of the house equipment and engineer. This unit gives me ;the ability to still go direct, but allows me to tweak the signal for maximum warmth. I suppose you could look at this like an effects stomp box but it is really so much more. if you play at church and are tired of hearing the life sucked out of your bass you should give this a try. I love it."
77969,"I didn't like the way they ended it, if they would have been given the opportunity to film the movie to wrap things up after the show was cancelled like they were originally going to do it would have been ok.This season had some good points, but overall it lacked the same punch the others had."
77970,"Like the previous reviewer, I bought this to switch out the stock one that came in my mic preamp, and it just did wonders to warm the sound. Only problem is, now I am eyeing my amp, all it's tubes, and thinking... if one little adjustment made such a difference in a pre-amp, imagine what some of these will do in my fender! Sigh! Always something!Anyway, this is great! I am sure I will get more!"
77971,"Previously my teenage son had bought a different brand of solar charger to recharge his smart phone while camping for a week in the mountains with his scout group. His old charger was a big favorite with the other scouts as everyone could charge their phones and iPods without needing electricity. Now, he's completely blown away by this new Goal Zero charger we received to test out from the Amazon Vine program.For about the same price as our previous solar charger, the Goal Zero charging kit has about 4 times the solar gathering power. It comes in a back-packing friendly fold up cover, with handy loops so you can attach it in open position to your pack while you travel. My son was able to charge his phone while actively hiking. The goal zero charger pushes power out through standard USB and the smaller USB plugs, and it even comes with a car-type outlet, so that you can plug-in car-type 12 volt adapters. It also has a battery pack that can hold AA or AAA batteries so that you can charge those, too. The kit happens to come with AA, but you can substitute your own AAA if that's what you need. The whole kit weighs 1.6 pounds, but the solar charger with just the USB is about 1 pound if you don't need the rest. It's a very useful kit to own when you need maximum utility from a lighter-weight addition to your pack."
77972,"Used it to hook-up our curt sway bar to our 25' trailer and this attachment made it easy!! We bought a Ball that detaches with a 2&#34; lift to attach it to. It lifted the trailer and we were able to attach the sway bar for less then 100 dollars (thats for the sway bar kit, the reese adaper peice and the new ball with lift) way less expensive then all those lifting kits that are 4-500 hundred dollars just starting out, granted many not be as good as a lift/equalizer kit but for someone on a tight budget it works!"
77973,"I was not going to pick this one up because recently I have been turned off with movies staring Robert Englund (Freddy Kruger) in the last couple of years as he seems to be getting a lot of roles in stinkers of movies.This one wasn't much better, however, as dumb and over the top as most of this movie was, by the time it was over, I had not been bored, I sat through the whole thing entertained, but when it was over, I think i said outloud a number of times ""W.T.F did I just witness""?I'm going to hope they intended this to be a comedy, because if it was meant to be serious then the jokes on them. The plot of this whole movie is pretty weak, a group of the best of the best army group, which consist of 3 emo dorks with guns, a moron who likes to lick knives, a pretty wimpy looking guy trying to be a bad mofo'n leader... oh, and a Paris Hilton wanna-be all go into a facility that a zombie outbreak has leaked out in and they gotta go in and shoot all the zombies.... something goes wrong, one of the emo soldiers is bitten, and instead of getting his brains blown out, he escapes to a strip club that is supposed to be illegal (what was illegal about it?) and like any person bitten by zombies, he becomes one, then attacks the star of the strip club and she becomes a zombie too. The club owner (Englund) doesn't mind that his new zombie girl goes out & strips, then takes a victim backstage and doesn't just take tips, but eats them too, as well as converting the rest of the strippers into zombies along the way. As long as it's making him some money, it's ok with him... until it all gets out of control.Describing that made it sound like the plot is a bit more then I thought, but it's not really. The army group have got to be the most unconvincing army persona ever assembled, to believe those D&D; grand masters survived military is a joke in itself... but this film wasn't going for realism, just stupidity and humor.So I haven't really said anything positive about the film, the acting and plot are not much, so why let it slide with 3 stars? Well, as I said, it's not boring, it is watchable, and fairly entertaining for a humor that is something like a Troma film, but with a bigger budget.I probably would have only given it 2 stars, maybe 2 and a half, but there was one scene in this movie that I was laughing hysterically at... it's a scene between two of the zombie strippers having a shoot out to see who's the better zombie, and the typical ping pong ball trick comes into play, but you'll have to see for yourself how it's played out, and what happens next... it's too ridicules to not find funny. So that scene alone I gave an extra star to.And then there is the make up and puppet fx that are actually very convincing and a lot better then you would expect. I was impressed hearing that things like the decapitated head was actually a puppet, or mechanical head rather then a real actors head with his body removed later with CGI or something.For the pervs, yes there is plenty of skin to see, provided you like skinny, bony-looking women with implants, which i found to be about as un-erotic as the zombie strippers decaying bodies through the films.... actually, i think they looked better as zombies... anyway, the end really spoils the movie when the worlds dumbest army troups come back into the movie to give the worlds most confusing ending that partly makes little sense, but leaves you wondering, WTF WAS THAT ABOUT??? then you re-cap the film and think, WTF?????? and i'm sitting here typing this review still thinking, WTF WAS THAT???????"
77974,"Bought this along with the heat mat and glad I did. My greenhouse gets pretty warm during the day so this helps keep the mat from overheating my seed trays. It's really nice, easy to use and constantly displays the temp of your medium. It has a sensor that you push into the medium so it's measuring the temp of the soil at all times. Well worth it!"
77975,Best basic waffle towel available hands down. Still very soft after numerous car washes and cleanings. Also works great as a drying towel for housework.
77976,Never heard of them but now I can wait to see them again and again. Will have you laugh out loud for sure.
77977,"I read reviews about this being a safer option for an acoustic guitar strap support than the usual tie-device. Working just fine so far, came quickly in the mail."
77978,"For my inground pool, I went through 2 offline chlorinator systems in 20 years.  The parts didn't actually break, but I was not able to get the lid off of them.  The glue used to hold the chlorine tablets together eventually coats the screw on lids (since they're filled to the top with water), and even with an incredible amount of force I wasn't able to open them after a period of years.  I bought this one in order to get away from that problem and it appears to work well.  I'm a bit surprised at how little chlorine actually gets dissolved in this unit.  I put five 3&#34; tablets in, and after a week there was still about 2.5 tablets left.  It isn't summer yet, so algae isn't a problem at the moment.  Then again, the water isn't very warm.  Perhaps when the water warms up the tablets will dissolve faster.  I would go through 10 tablets a week in the offline chlorinators in the summer."
77979,Not a flashy strap but great in the studio or on stage when you need to change guitars fast.Light weight allows you to remove quickly.It is pretty comfortable to wear also.
77980,"This stove top smoker is one of the best products I have ever used (and I use it often).  I have had this thing for about 5 or 6 years now.  It is as good as the day I bought it.  I smoke chicken and ribs mainly but you can smoke just about anything that you could in a regular smoker (just not as much in terms of amount).  It is easy to clean and the wood chips are reasonable in price.  You only use about a teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on what you are smoking.  I would highly recommend this product.  The best wood to use is hickory (it is the all around best for all types of meats).  The next best as far as i have found is the Cherry.  It imparts a nice fruity taste to meat.  If anything happens to this smoker, I will certainly buy another one.  This product is one that lasts and lasts!"
77981,The best and lonest running sifi on tv ever. I have been a fan since 1970s. I think my wife loves it more them myself.
77982,Can't wait to see the whole season.  Best of the bunch.  Good casting and excellent writing.  This would easily become a program we would watch weekly.
77983,"Arrived on time and highest quality and have the felt washers to further protect your guitar... very easy to install, but make sure you drill a pilot hold so your do not injure or split the wood on your instrument."
77984,"I am a converted guitar player and I like playing with a pick.  I like that sharp thwack sound.  But the tone can be a little harsh, so I got these.  They are much quieter than a hard pick but the tone is not the same as bare fingers.  For me, they were a waste of money."
77985,recently a researcher decoded ten wordsthis may be something you can grab on tobut like the one who wrote itisn't it a great waste of time
77986,"The story idea promulgated here would make a great series, but someone needs to take both director and scriptwriter aside, then explain to them the importance of comedic timing and good lines.  Saying the F word multiple times might make teens laugh, but to adults, it's boring.  A bad writer uses f-word comedy, because he can't think his way out of a paper bag.  A good writer, doesn't need swear words, but relies on real content in the lines.  How often did you hear swear words in Mash?  Seldom, and when used, they were appropriate, not gratuitous.  Yeah, LBJ swore a lot.  Yeah, maybe Huey Long did too, I don't remember.  (John Goodman is a Huey Long archetype.)  But your average Senator doesn't talk like a truck driver, k?Great cast:  they deserve a better writer than they receive.  The pilot drags and then speeds up and slows down and pulls you every which way;  all the while, you sense that the 'plot' is only designed for spoofing, and each actor is just supposed to deliver his lines on cue.  It's not even Saturday Night Live quality material.Whoever directed the pilot should go back to drama school.  The shots, angles, don't fit the plotline needs.REDO IT RIGHT, and you'll have a hit.  Keep the cast, lose the writer, director, or whoever thought that this pilot should be produced 'as is'."
77987,"Havahart 1064 Large is not only functional, sturdy, and well made, but also aesthetic.  The only serious reservation raises the small size of the handle in the middle-top making it difficult to carry the trap by 2 people side-by-side except by those with small hands - who usually are weaker - but still not conveniently and very close to the middle mesh exposing their thighs to the animal's claws.  The trap also is lacking 2 handles at both ends allowing carrying it by 2 people easier than side-by-side and farther away from its middle mesh important especially when a raging heavy clever animal inside is tilting the trap and is eager to attack through the mesh with long sharp claws."
77988,"The HBO series ""Family Tree"" is the latest endeavor by comic genius Christopher Guest (co-created with Jim Piddock, another terrific comedic actor). Guest has been in the business for decades as a writer, director and actor (shout out to Spinal Tap). For me, his artistic peak as a filmmaker came with his series of faux documentary features that began with 1996's ""Waiting for Guffman"" and carried on with 2000's ""Best in Show,"" 2003's ""A Mighty Wind,"" and 2006's ""For Your Consideration."" Guest's specialty in these films is that he really understands his subjects and has a genuine affection for them. Although absurd, they have an underlying tenderness and sweetness. He and his cast of largely improvisational performers (there is a somewhat regular stable) skewer topics such as amateur theater, dog shows, folk music, or the quest for Academy Award glory. Deadpan and droll, these features are both wickedly funny (especially Guffman and Show) and surprisingly truthful. Their humor stems from the fact that they treat their characters with respect and embrace the oddity inherent in the environments they inhabit. I mention this tone specifically, because if you have no idea what I'm talking about than ""Family Tree"" may confound your expectations somewhat.Although moments in this eight part series are laugh out loud funny, the show's sense of humor can be understated as well. Chris O'Dowd plays a typical Londoner entering into an existential mid-life crisis. After losing his job and his girl, he becomes somewhat directionless. One day, he collects a strange box of remembrances left to him by a deceased Aunt he hardly knew. Upon poking through this rather meager collection, he finds an old photograph of (what he presumes) is his grandfather and this opens up an unexpected mission. He want to understand his family, his heritage, and maybe his own sense of identity in the process. As he embarks on a quest that will take him around England and eventually to California, he will meet an assortment of eccentrics ranging from odd to absolutely loony. The show is good natured, with charm to spare, and O'Dowd has a wide-eyed enthusiasm that is infectious. I was totally committed to his journey, no matter where it led.Like the films I mentioned, this plays with a mockumentary feel where the actors are just allowed to play off one another extemporaneously. O'Dowd is assisted and often accompanied by his sister (Nina Conti) and exuberant best friend (Tom Bennett). The cast features Guest stalwarts like Michael McKean (O'Dowd's father), Ed Begley Jr., and Fred Willard with both Guest and Piddock also appearing. McKean is a standout and the source of some great running jokes (British TV, odd inventions). Bennett takes a rather conventional character of the bawdy best friend and serves up some of the biggest laughs. And O'Dowd is a terrific host to the proceedings. His reactions to what unfolds can be fantastic, I just loved watching his face. I have to (it is imperative) make special mention of Nina Conti, the show's absolute MVP in my estimation. Conti performs the entire show with a ventriloquist's monkey on her hand. Monkey (that's his name) has a scathing wit that often boils things down to their true essence. Reading this, you might think this borders on farce, but Conti is absolutely mesmerizing (she'd be on my short list for Supporting Actress at the Emmys). In the end, ""Family Tree"" might be too British, too quiet, or too odd for a mass market audience. But if you love Guest and/or British humor, ""Family Tree"" is a comedy with both laughs and heart. KGHarris, 7/13."
77989,"Yes, you can use these to drop your stabilizer jacks or leveling scissors.  However, this item also works w/ the BAL Leveler.  So for my PUP I can do my stabilizers and BAL Leveler w/ one socket.  This never gets disconnected from the dedicated cordless drill I have for my camper !!!!"

77991,"The Miracle-Gro LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Food Advanced Starter Kit is a quick and easy way to fertilize your plants.  While a measuring spoon is included, if you use the sprayer there is no need for measuring.  Attach the bottle to the sprayer and attach the hose to the bottom of the spray nozzle.  Done, you are ready to start.The spray nozzle includes several settings from spraying to a more direct flow (great for soaking the bottom of plants and soil).  The nozzle is fairly well built.  It's plastic, but appears to be tough.  Overall, it doesn't get any easier.  This kit offers you a way to feed with no fuss and no mess."
77992,"I have 4 hot tubs at my b&b; and I've always used the products that are recommended by the manufacturers (Nordic or Solara or my big commercial unit which uses bromine or chlorine). Generally, I just change the water out a lot, preferring to have clean water over highly chemically water. When I saw this product I was thrilled. I put the recommended amount into one of our 2 person tubs, which had some slight oiling on the surface from lotion or body oil. When I came back to check it an hour later there was a disgusting yellowish cottage cheese substance all over the surface. I don't know if this is what happens when the enzymes meet a certain type or amount of organic material, but I do know that it was a giant MESS. I ended up cleaning and flushing the tub twice, changing filters 3 times, just to get the new water free of whatever substance was in there.I spoke with somebody from the company and he suggested I try a test, to see if it was the enzyme, or my icky plumbing that was to blame. Well, I did the gallon of water test, and no ""cheese"" formed. So then I put it into the tub that I initially tried the enzyme in, and it also is cheese-free. I guess what I would recommend is that you use this product when you have ample time to empty, flush, and re-fill the tub, just in case there is a bunch of gunk in your system. I will be interested to see how this product works over time. We do a pretty frequent empty and clean on the tubs, so this was really a shocking amount of build up in the system. It will be interesting to see how this product works now that the tub has been cleaned of ""cheese"" and will be on weekly maintenance with the enzyme. The company is very responsive to any questions or concerns you have about their product and seem to be very knowledgeable."
77993,"I love River Monsters. This is my most favorite show on TV today. Jeremy Wade is very informative, brave, and crazy. I've learned more about fish on his show than I have over years of watching tons and tons of documentaries. Plus is exciting to watch his journeys and encounters with people."
77994,"This show is a window into a part of American culture, in a region that I knew almost nothing about.  It helps that the acting is just great.  I'd love to see more good shows shot in the &#34;heartland&#34; and fewer in LA."

77996,I though it was well done. it was sad to see Paul Walker in one of his last movies to be made.
77997,"I have to confess after the series opening presentation I never really watched the rest of the series.This was probably made to placate the devoted series watchers that found their programs cut off. Many different series ether just stop or have a pansy wrap up for the last episode. If we are lucky as with ""Veronica Mars"" we are treated to a full length movie that tries to incorporate the essence of the series. With Star Trek there was a series of movies. We can only hope so here.Veronica was a teenage private eye. Now older and supposedly wiser on the verge of getting a cushy law firm job, she is called back home to help pick a lawyer to defend an old boyfriend. He was accused of murdering one of her old classmates. Naturally as we would've suspected she gets sucked into trying to track down the culprit(s) herself. Will she give up the cushy job and her new boyfriend and a new life just to save her old boyfriend and possibly cleanup the local law enforcement at the same time?If you seen one of these ""let's find culprit as the only way to vindicate the suspect"" stories that you see most of them. The worth in this particular movie is that it has the formula and the characters that we've all come to identify with in the series. This film also gives hope that there might be a series of films."
77998,My kids 8-11 liked this and thought it was cute. They said they would watch this show again. The ending was the only part they questioned and they did ask for more science experiment s.
77999,Too many sharks jumped in first three episodes
78000,Breaking Bad is the best television I have seen since the Sopranos. It is so well acted and so well written. I absolutely loved watching this show.
78001,It is about time TV gave us something to think about!  I love this show and hope it gets renewed for several seasons.  We need more thoughtful and adult programming for those of us who hunger for intellectual stimulation.
78002,"My wife grew up in West Texas where mesquite is the smoking wood king, but we moved away more than 30 years ago and have missed that slow cooked mesquite flavor ever since.  Once mesquite is in your blood it is hard to fall in love with anything else.  One of my key philosophies is ""if someone else can do it, so can I.""  Unfortunately, even with my philosophy, we were never able to duplicate the flavors and textures we enjoyed in West Texas.  We tried using the Weber Kettle with mesquite-infused charcoal, mesquite wood chips, indirect heat, water pans, etc, but we could never get the temperature control or the smoke we needed to match the West Texas mesquite flavor of slow smoked briskets, chickens, and turkeys we remembered.  We always thought of buying a smoker but never did because there were just too many options to choose from and friends I knew that had a smoker all had complaints.  Granted, we've tasted a lot of good smoked meats over the years, but nothing ever matched what we missed.That all changed with the Smokenator.  Some endeavors take a lot more education, experience, and money than I'm willing to devote, but that's not the case with the Smokenator.  You can have great smoked meats with very little education, experience, and money.  The directions are probably the best written ""how-to"" you can find.  The only change I made is I monitor temp at the cooking surface not the dome vent.  The Smokenator is ridiculously easy to load, control, and use with our Weber Kettle and a Maverick digital oven thermometer.  After the first use of the Smokenator loaded with Kingsford briquettes and mesquite wood chunks we felt like we found West Texas in our backyard and in our bellies once again.  After three decades away from the Lone Star state, the memories came flooding back with the first bite.  We LOVE our Smokenator!Update:  Bottom line, if you want to learn to smoke meat and already own a Weber Kettle, the Smokenator is the most inexpensive yet extremely effective accessory you can buy that will teach you everything you need to know about charcoal smokers, temperature control, patience, personal technique and recipes.  A wireless dual probe thermometer like the Maverick ET-732 or 733 is an absolute must for consistent results.  I measure temp at grill surface and only measure temp at the vent if I'm smoking a large or tall piece of meat like a turkey or beer can chicken, then I monitor both grill and vent temps!People always ask me what I can smoke with the Smokenator and a 22"" Weber Kettle?  I have smoked everything I can get my hands on that I enjoy; salmon, whole chickens, chicken breasts, chicken thighs, chicken leg quarters, chuck roasts, pork butts, pork shoulders, pork tenderloins, pork loins, St Louis Cut Spare Ribs, baby back ribs, beef ribs, peppers with cheese stuffing wrapped in bacon, whole turkeys up to 17 lbs, turkey breasts, and I've even made Canadian bacon.  I'm going to make pastrami in the next week or two with a corned beef round we have in the freezer.  Brisket is the only thing I haven't smoked yet and that's because I've been waiting to receive a vacuum sealer for Christmas so we can better save the meat once smoked. Trust me, with the experience I developed with the Smokenator I have absolutely no fear of slapping a 10-15 lbs brisket on the Weber knowing I'll get great results. BTW, I rarely use a water pan any longer but still pull it out with salmon.  I now have several sizes of water pans.The Smokenator is a great end in itself, but I now want to smoke in greater volume because with most smokes I do on the weekend the meat is gone by Tuesday or Wednesday.  My wife purchased a 22"" Weber Smokey Mountain (WSM) for me for Christmas.  The Kettle and the Smokenator will still get used quite a bit though because it is WAY more efficient than the 22"" WSM and great for quick smokes like salmon or chicken.  For example, today I made another batch of Canadian bacon on the Kettle.  There was enough leftover charcoal from my last smoke in the Smokenator that all I added were 18 hot Kingsford briquettes to the Smokenator and four pieces of apple wood.  I smoked the pork tenderloins for four hours at 215F-225F until they reached an internal temp of 160F. I added no more fuel to the Smokenator for the entire smoke.The Smokenator is one amazing accessory to the Weber Kettle."

78004,"weak, boring completely flawed characters. As much as I was drawn into the first episode's plot and as much as I wanted to love this show with all the mystery surrounding  the murders and the excitement I just couldn't enjoy it as much because the characters didn't really grab me and as time went by I became less and less interested in the plot to begin with.Danny is a teenage boy who's back in town, the only difference is he spent the last couple of years in jail for murdering none other but his aunt who was baby setting him and his two childhood friends Joe and Lacey one afternoon. Now, Danny claims he's not a psychopath or a sociopath nor did he murder his aunt by accident, he did it on purpose fully knowing the consequences *something involving a necklace?* but he refuses to tell anyone the real reason behind it which not only sounds odd and strange it also makes me question the sanity of Danny's character granted he was 9 at the time so what could he possibly know about his aunt to make such a decision. His mother extremely good looking and glamorous compared to the rest of the mothers on the show, is not only a source of envy and despise she's also insisting on making the rest of the town accept her criminal son at all costs including flirting with the local High school's principle and attending public ceremonies. Joe is torn between being loyal to her murderer ex, childhood friend and the fact that oh well he is a murderer who put them through a traumatic experience considering he committed the murder while they were on scene. Lacy though nostalgic for the past is convincing herself and others that she's totally against him and unwilling to accept him as a friend. Not long after Danny's return another murder happens this time Lacy's best friend Regina who's the popular/air head pretty mediocre girl in school is the victim. Now of course everyone blames Danny considering his obvious dark past and Joe's father is working very hard to find an evidence that'll link him to the murder and put him in jail this time forever if necessary. Meanwhile, we don't know who the real murderer is.Yes, the plot is interesting for a mystery drama but after a while it just seems so contrived and dragged on. It also seems very unbelievable at times. Danny is your golden child knows everything, straight A student, a pro at playing soccer for god's sake after spending years in jail? You really want me to believe that he doesn't find it hard at all to fit right back into society. He's so at ease with other people and with the public community that it's like he never left. Now in reality most criminals will find some difficulty in dealing with the real world after being locked up for so long. Lacy as a character is completely torn she doesn't know if she wants to be Danny's friend or his enemy. She's the classic know it all girl in High school that you just wanted to strangle at times. So perfect, so elegant. Boring! Joe is the only one who stands out from the crowd by trying to actually look at the bigger picture instead of hating on Danny like everyone else and blaming him for every murder there is in town wether he did it or not, except she too has her doubts and is confused at times. She stands up for her childhood friend for reasons unknown *I smell a romance anyone?* Danny's mother is conniving and overly ambitious trying to climb the social ladder, your average desperate housewife, the socialist, rich woman. The rest of the characters are two dimensional and very stereotypical as well. The jerks in school who are popular and exude over confidence that borders into arrogance, the fake blonds, the hateful towns people who are so narrow minded and empty headed they believe anything the news would tell them as truth. I just couldn't stand half of the characters.Yeah, give it a try. The show has it's redeeming qualities I'll only continue watching because I want to know who the murderer is and why Danny killed his aunt. I don't even watch a full episode anymore I just fast forward it cause I get bored easily with the unnecessary details.EDIT: *SPOILER ALERT* :;So I just continued watching further episodes to see if it'll improve and now it appears to be that Lacy has a crush on Danny. So Joe and Lacy are both fighting for Danny's affections. A very unlikable character who's a snob, and a very likely turn of events. Makes the show even stupider than it was."
78005,Great for RV.........Camco 39761 RhinoFLEX 15' RV Sewer Hose Kit with Swivel Fittings....The best out there for your RV very happy and glad to get it through Amazon!~
78006,"My only complaint would be that the leads (wires) are pretty short, although I understand the reasons for making them that way.Appears to be sufficiently accurate and is very easy to use."
78007,"I agree with the former reviewer that these seem a bit pricey but I purchased two via warehouse deals and managed to save a bit. One went under the sink and fits absolutely perfectly on the cabinet door in front of the sliding trays. The other went in the bathroom. Both are easy to install and provide a nice closing action. Use small kitche bags for ease of emptying. Tiny spring is simple to fit back in if it falls out or easy to replace. Perfect for tissues, kitchen scraps and other small misc needs."
78008,"When you sell your jeep, take everything off. I sold my jeep with all of my little additions, but didnt thing I would be buying another jeep down the line. I missed it so much, I bought another one. These are great and CHEAP. Not cheap in quality, but in price. Simple to install. I would recommend."
78009,I find the show funny and in some cases so true to life.  Its nice to watch something thats not a reality show.  Daria shows its not bad to be yourself whoever or whatever you want to be.
78010,"I've bought similar products for other trucks in the past, and even the molded ""custom Fit"" end up being junk.  I got my Rugged Ridge floor liners a couple days ago and all I can say is WOW.  I love the look, I love the fit.  It's like they belong in the Jeep.  But these have form and function and I expect to get good use of these for a long time.  Thanks for making a quality product."
78011,"We start our 1/4 acre vegetable garden in February in the green house.  If we use rooting hormone, this is the one we buy.  However, my brother has gotten so good at the process that he rarely uses any hormone any more.  Plants will root fine without the hormone but the hormone helps the plant transition from water to soil (or pearlite or sand as another reviewer recommends).If your situation calls for rooting hormone, this is the one to use."
78012,"This 90* elbow does exactly what you would expect.  It's easy to install, features a nice, soft O-ring (some of these things don't), it seals well and can be left on your RV.  In my case, the 90* bend really helps route my potable water hose nicely."
78013,"Season two of top, shot is a whole different bag compared to season one. If you thought the first season didn't have enough compition or drive in it, this season has plently of both. This time the rivialry between the teams is much more intense and the compitiotn, nomination range and elimination challenges feel, a lot more intense.This however comes at a price, the mood of this season is a lot darker, both in terms of the enviroment and the players relationships with each other. There is lots more bickering and disagreement this season, so much so that this time there aren't enough fingers to point at.The bickering also makes one team be featured a lot more then the other team and unlike season 1, it's so uneven that (for me at least), the non featured team gets most of it's members so buried you don't remember who's who untill there's way less people left.This season has two saving graces in my mind. One the individual part of the game has some pretty innovative challenges and the right person won. Who that person is should be obvious once you reach the last few.On the whole, season 2 was enjoyable and I'll pick up the dvds, but I consider this a step down from season 1. Some of you won't but I do.Edit: Having viewed season 4 and rewatched parts of this season, this season has become more likeable. I have decided to up the rating to 4 stars."
78014,"I have yet to install this neck, but have purchased enough necks over the years to have a really good idea of what to expect. There is little to no evidence of corners being cut, just to start. Materials and labor all look good to great. Measuring for fit and specifications is on the money. Not having the mounting screw holes drilled is actually a plus as most &#34;econo necks&#34; seem to be off by at least 1/8.&#34; I'd rather have the trouble of drilling them from scratch than having to plug them with dowels and re-drill. Frets look good, and nut looks good. Until I can install it, I can only really vouch for 4/5 stars.Long story short is this neck looks better than many I've had that cost 2X as much, or more. Unless it has a twist or hump, it actually earns the 5th star. Even if the frets need a little cleanup, it still earns the 5th star. While some may not like the flatter radius, I'd argue that it makes it easier to get the frets in so that they aren't as much of an issue. And it is clearcoated - maybe not a nice amber finish, but most more expensive necks may have no finish at all. So again, another reason for the 5th star."
78015,"the hole at the end where you hook it up gets worn out easily .. just try and leave it on always..its cheap but it wont fail, wont drop your guitar, if you're careful."
78016,No news here.  I  bought it but not used it yet. Will update it lower if it does not work well when I get it on the RV
78017,"I watch lots of series, but this one just lets you imagine what it would be like to have special powers and what you would do with them if you had them.  It's kind of a knock off of other shows but still interesting and fun to watch."
78018,Have had these on for awhile now and they work good. The light is a little blue not too bad. No issues so far
78019,"""Arbitrage"" stars Richard Gere as a Wall Street hedge-fund tycoon Robert Miller. He is a family man, shrewd businessman and suave womanizer, who is on the verge of disaster. I should not write about here what kind of disaster (that comes in two forms) awaits Robert on his 60th birthday. All I can say is that, written and directed by Nicholas Jarecki, the film keeps us guessing what's next, following the story of this complicated man struggling to save what he holds dear.But the reason the film works is the presence of Richard Gere (nominated for Golden Globe), one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. You may not like the man he plays, but Gere makes the tormented protagonist more interesting than the usual stock character. The cast includes Susan Sarandon, Tim Roth, Brit Marling, Laetitia Casta, Nate Parker, and Graydon Carter, editor of ""Vanity Fair.""As a thriller or a morality tale, ""Arbitrage"" does not offer anything new, but with Richard Gere's superb performance and Yorick Le Saux's lush cinematography, the film is a pretty entertaining ride."
78020,"Running 3 to 5 pedals on my board, this was a logical choice of power. The single transformer running into the board with the multi-plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs, combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board. There is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak. Further, with the transformer being well away from the board, there is zero AC hum. What's not to like here?"
78021,"If you've never had a pedalboard before I'd say pass on this one and look for one that is more user-friendly.  The pics and description don't show just how insanely large this is.  It's too big.  Patch cables are crap and the power supply didn't seem sturdy enough to be kicked around.Besides this, I had trouble using it (even for practice) because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedals.I ended up giving this one away to a friend and getting a Gator 'bone' and a seperate power supply.  Easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with mics/cables rather than being a whole suitcase on it's own."
78022,"I just used this after thatching my lawn of all the dead roots and grass.  After cleaning the soil, I watered the lawn.  Only then did I use this aerator.  Very simple to use. Just put your foot inside and step on the ground, and put your weight on it.  I walked around my lawn with this. It was not back breaking work.It did not compact your soil as others have mentioned.  If you watered the soil, and the soil is wet, it will put holes through the soil then pull up some soil.  It loosened up my top soil.  I then proceded to plant the grass seeds.  After 1 week, grass has started growing and evenly too. My lawn is starting to look good, nice and green.I highly recommend this.  Actually, the reason I bought this is because my neighbor has one, and he used it on his lawn.  His lawn looks great, so I just followed his lead."
78023,"Start with a subject then add the top conspiracy theorists and you end up with a 'documentary' on Puff the Magic Dragon VS Godzilla. Is the History Channel becoming the next Learning Channel - you know, where 'learning' is discovering Honey Boo Boo? Or how to have a litter of children? Or extreme couponing?  Isn't fact based history important or interesting enough without having to cater to the lowest common denominator and IQ?  If I were the 'Woman Born With 14 Thumbs' (hoping for the next prime time slot on TLC) all would be pointed down on this gobbly-gook!"
78024,"Lets start with the seed pods the kit comes with - it comes with 18 pods that make up 13 different vegetables and herbs.  There are duplicates of a few: 1 Globe Tomato, 1 Cherry Tomato, 1 Cucumber, 1 Bush Bean, 2 Loose-Leaf Lettuce, 2 Butterhead Lettuce, 1 Romaine Lettuce, 1 Snap Pea, 1 Smooth-Leaf Spinach, 1 Sweet Pepper Plus, 2 Basil, 2 Cilantro, 2 DillSo in all, it is a nice starter selection of starts (assuming they all thrive in your area).  I am planting mine late in the season, so I'm not sure how many will do well as the big heat of Summer has already passed.The pods are larger than traditional seed starting pods that you can plant yourself, but they also contain plant food at the bottom, and normally you add that afterward, so that part is pretty neat.They are REALLY easy to plant too- pull off the paper seal on the top that says what it is, and gently put it in your prepared dirt... water... and wallah!  Your plant start is on the way!So, lets talk what is included - there are 2 different tomato plants - assuming they do well, you'll get a lot of tomatoes from the plants - so they are a good choice.  The Cucumber, Bush Bean, Snap Pea and Sweet Peppers should also all provide multiple veggies per plant, which is great.  In my experience (I don't have the greenest thumb in the world, but can generally hold my own), here in Washington, I tend to have trouble with the leafy veggies (spinach, lettuce - of which this kit has 6) - the slugs come enjoy them before we can - so  little tip a relative gave me - wash some egg shells, crush them and mix them in with the dirt.  The slugs don't like the scratch on their bellies, and will turn around and leave.  Then we have the herbs - 2 each of basil, cilantro and dill - in my experience, with a smallish garden, this is a great number of plants - I normally do 1 basil, 1 cilantro and 3 dill (for pickles).The kit also includes some fun recipes, and it seems like the vegetable/herb mix is great for Washington State as everything grows really well here.I would say that this kit really is great if you want to grow your plants from seeds (which cuts down the expense of planting a garden, and is fun to watch grow), if you have limited space and still want a fun variety, or if you are planting a garden with kids.  If you are aiming to mass-produce veggies and herbs in your garden, don't get this kit - you are ahead of this one and can do the starts yourself with the small peat discs and a covered holder."
78025,"I use this on the fretboard of my new Hohner wc03 Parlor and two Epiphone AJ220sce Acoustics. They had mimimal oil/stain from the factory.  Keeps the wood smooth and beautiful for much longer than a few weeks.  I use it every other time I restring my guitars, It is a really good product, I use it on all of my guitars, except my Strat that has a maple neck.."
78026,This is my 6 year olds absolute favorite and I can't argue. Their theme of &#34;we have the whole wide world&#34; is a testament to the wonderment of stretching a child's imagination. In every episode they step into their backyard and let their minds go. There is always something to learn.  There is also infectious music (my favorite is the space song by Alicia Keyes) and these Backyardigans have got to be the best dancing cartoons characters ever.
78027,"If you have a pot or planter that has no way to drain excess water, this little gadget helps. As some of you already know, when you over-water plants, one of two things (sometimes both) happens: either the tray that holds excess water fills up, sometimes overflowing, or if you have no tray for excess water, the plant begins to die as the roots drown, resulting in a dead plant and a lot of stinky water. This device can help with that, especially for pots and planters with no receptacle for the extra water. What happens with this pot filler is this: the excess water, so long as there isn't a HUGE amount of it, will pool in this mesh, away from plant roots. While the soil eventually dries out, this can continue to provide moisture to the soil while preventing the rot that can eventually kill a plant. My mom used to use rocks at the bottom of her pots, which was just as effective, but boy does it make them heavy to move around! This is a great alternative to rocks, and it is reusable. Nice product!"
78028,"I read many negative reviews on several sites.  I can understand how the quality may not be consistent, but as a seasoned folk and ethnic musician, I must say that the set I just purchased is quite good, especially the lower pitched harps in G, A and Bb.  There are minor tuning issues with all instruments, especially folk instruments.  This is what gives them their charm and voice.  I find my whole set to be of very adequate quality and I will not need replacement harps right away, as many have stated they had to do.  The set is quite nice, for the price!"
78029,"This was a nice idea for a short film. Its a strange parody of a horror film complete with breaking the fourth wall. Its really about breaking the rules of story and film in general. A tire comes to life out in the desert, comes to town and kills a bunch of people. The acting is generally good. The ""bits"" as written are well done. But the whole thing is way, way padded out. The idea just doesn't have enough in it to carry the whole film alone. And the filler between the good bits gets real boring fast.They either needed to cut it down to 20 minutes or add something major to the story. The laughs just don't come fast enough and the good bits they do are quite obviously spread far apart. Some people will like it in its current length. Its arty and cute at 80 minutes. But those outside the European art house crowd are going to notice how the story drags really quick. And putting space between absurdist gags tends to undermine them.Quentin Dupieux displays considerable talent in doing short films. He previous did the French film ""steak"" which was similarly absurdist. But he needs to get beyond writing a series of bits and gags. He needs to learn how to pace out a full length film and how to put together a long form story. Or else he should stick to shorter films.Its not perfect. But its creative, well crafted with good writing and good acting. In spite of its flaws, its absolutely worth seeing. Though best viewed with the fast forward button ready to go at all times."

78031,"This feeder isn't all designery like those made by Perky Pet, but hummingbirds seem to like it better, it cleans up reasonably well, and none of the materials are toxic to birds (no copper or zinc galvanization as seen on many other products).  There's no paint to peel off like has happened with the other brand, and the red color is what seems to attract hummers most reliably."
78032,"This lukewarm comedy is about a young couple (Ben and Lindsey) dealing with the aftermath of the Rapture, which includes flaming rocks constantly falling from the sky, occasional showers of blood, and an Anti-Christ named Earl, although he'd prefer it if you called him Beast. There's some kind of plot involving Beast's attempt to steal Lindsey from Ben, but really that's just an excuse to showcase some apocalyptic humor/sight-gags as well as the movie's fairly impressive array of comedic talent.There are quite a few problems here, however. Foremost among them, the script -- by the same guy who brought us Bill & Ted lo these many years ago -- doesn't have the steam to stay interesting. Second, although I've often enjoyed her in the many supporting roles I've seen her in, I'm now convinced Anna Kendrick just doesn't have the chops to carry a film. Her portrayal of our leading lady, Lindsey, has all the riveting depth of a glass of water. (Her boyfriend, Ben, is also about as boring as characters get -- his passion is sandwiches -- and the actor who portrays him is immediately forgettable.) Likewise, I love Craig Robinson, but his Beast is so cartoonishly one-note that it becomes tired pretty quickly, not to mention it robs his character of what little menace he's supposed to have. And he's definitely supposed to have some menace. He's the Anti-Christ, for Pete's sake. Add some story twists that make no sense at all (you know a movie's gone off the rails when it sacrifices coherency for the sake of an easy laugh), as well as a constant (and completely unnecessary) voice over by Lindsey that becomes more and more annoying the longer it goes on, and you've got all the ingredients for a flub.However! All is not lost. The comedians they got to work on this do their damnedest and the results are not without their merits. Rob Corddry, Thomas Lennon, Ken Jeong, Paul Scheer, John Higgins, Rob Huebel (probably my favorite of the film), Ana Gasteyer, and even Robinson when he isn't mugging it up all turn out some pretty solid and laugh-worthy performances. Ignore the uninspired and rote story-telling and focus on the tested comedy muscle, and this film won't be a total wash for you."

78034,"The MXR CSP202 or Dunlop Custom Comp is exactly what I'd been searching for...For years I played with only a crybaby and a phase 45 on the floor and everything else in a rack system. The rack systems had amazing studio quality compression and big complex delay boards, blah blah blah... but these days everything I have sits on a Furman SPB-8C Pedal Board (Highly recommended) and so I've been quietly searching for a serviceable foot pedal compressor, and that is harder to find than I had previously imagined... apparently they aren't easy to make..? I've been through 4 (coun't 'em four) foot pedal compressors and wasn't at all happy... an engineer mixer buddy said go try this pedal MXR CSP202 - so I did - and it's perfect...Benefits:1) It's easy to match your output gain on the pedal - so when you step on it - the pedal activates quality compression and NOT output volume suppression2) It's easy to understand right away - 3 seconds of looking at the pedal and you're done - 3 minutes of fooling around with it and you get it3) It's quiet but very effective and professional sounding4) It's solid and works exactly like very expensive rack compressionNegatives:1) It's expensive considering there are compression pedals for 1/2 this price2) It's got the 9 volt power supply connector on the wrong side of the input quarter inch jackOver all the thing is a Home Run - you can work around he poorly located 9 volt connection - you can wait a few weeks and save a few more dollars if you need to, but you can't fix a bad compression pedal if you buy the wrong one... I highly recommend this pedal, after a long process of searching and being disappointed I'm glad I found this pedal"
78035,The rhythm & percussion of NYPD and the great stories keep my mind off the &#34;work&#34; in my aerobic workout. One episode is the right length.
78036,"Love this show.  Season 2  just as good as Season 1.  Love the character development and just when you think you have it figured out something changes.  I imagine it happening just this way.  It's the good guys against the bad guys, even after the power goes out.  Highly recommended."

78038,"The acting is excellent. The story is gripping. It's well shot. The soundtrack is fitting and great. The character development is intelligent, consistent, and believable. Each episode makes you want to watch the next episode. Even my wife, who initially did not want to watch this show, has gotten into it. She thought it was just white trash crap. She thought it was just manly stuff for her husband to watch. But then, after much coaxing, she gave it a chance. Now she's more engaged than I am! And I'm the Harley rider!I will make one note of caution: this show is probably not for young children (you decide what age that means - you know your kids better than I do). It's violent and explicit. There are things I would not want my 8 year old to see. I don't care about the sex stuff, but the violent images can be disturbing, even for an adult."

78040,Great show...a blast from the past.....great production quality...music...storylines....and acting....the only thing I don't like about it is you don't have season two yet lol
78041,"I gave this 4 stars because it is a great, gentle, all in one protectant.  It performs as promised.  Would not hesitate to get it.  One thing for sure.....  If you want a 5 STAR product, get the KLASSE Sealant/Protectant in the Silver jug.  It is fantastic, and if I was only going to get ONE KLASSE product, it would be the Sealant just mentioned.  The silver bottle!  Red bottle comes in at one step behind.  But both are good."
78042,"The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-6 Fab Flange effects pedal works great and gives me that wobble phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit...  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
78043,Not as exciting as some but I enjoy the story line.  It does make you think about the possibilities.  I would recommend it.  Though there are some out there that best this series.  This is a interesting addition to scifi tv.
78044,"This pilot was intriguing.  All these people get stuck on the elevator and then locked in the parking garage.  When one gets out to try and find help, she is stunned by what she sees.  The city is in utter chaos.  This is more than just a power failure.  All the people on the stranded elevator have the same birthday.  What's with that?  We have a French actress, a police officer, a clown, a felon with a shotgun, who seems to be trying to help and declares his innocence, a diabetic, rich elderly lady who lives with just her housekeeper in this mansion.  Are all the characters going to be more developed and the ending was just so unexpected.  You have to see more episodes to see what is going on."
78045,They are perfedt.
78046,I have always been a dedicated Mirror Glaze person until I discovered that there are products that far surpass what even they offer. This went on super easy using the straight line method illustrated on autogeek.com and it wiped off to a super glossy shine after 45 minutes. Amazing stuff that is supposed to last 4-6 months (almost twice as long as regular wax).
78047,"""I think it&#8217;s bad that I try not to get excited about things anymore, but I was trying really hard not to get excited about this. I am a Joss Whedon fan, I loved ""Buffy"", ""Angel"", ""Firefly"", and ""Dr. Horrible"". ""The Dollhouse"" was alright, but I&#8217;m really glad it ended so Joss could...""Read full review here:[...]"
78048,"We thought that the kids in this show were very clever, and were glad to see that they allowed a girl to play a role as a smart kid. If Amazon picks it up, we will watch it."
78049,"i don't like using a lot of chemicals on my garden, i love the safer brand and specifically this soap.  i have some smaller citrus trees that are prone to the citrus leafminer.  that is why i got the concentrate to mix a big batch and put in a sprayer.  this soap is effective on everything i've tried it on...grasshoppers, leafminers, leafhoppers, mealy bugs, scale, ants.  i even spray it on my orchid flowers to deter the grasshoppers and it has no deleterious effects on them."
78050,"I use to change my oil every 3,000 miles so the Jiffy lube filters were fine. Now that my SUV has 80,000 miles and does not get the use it use to, I decided to go 5,000 miles between changes and that could mean my oil will be in the engine for almost a year between changes. I switched to synthetic oil and did a bunch of research on oil filters. This one with the Filtech media kept appearing at the top of everyones list. As usual Amazon did its part on price and delivery. The filter seems solid and fits well. Not much more to say from this end. I did the research and for the money this filter ranks at the top of the list.One last thing. My 2005 Lexus uses the same filter and I had one in my cart ready to purchase in the near future. I noticed one day that the price had gone down by 50% so I jumped on it. Next day it was back up there. Love those impromptu sale offers."
78051,"I love the Hola! small instrument stand. It is sturdy and folds up nicely for me to take with me when I go to the Ukulele Club. It has a nice rubber padding so I trust putting my instrument on it. I have a Tenor Ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand. It is very lightweight which is also a plus. I use the stand at home too. I stand my ukulele on it because sometimes I play and then I want to go to YouTube to listen to a particular song. It is very convenient.  I have recommended this stand to others also.Features I like: lightweight, sturdy and folds up easily."
78052,Tries this in an area of our yard where we have a mole problem and it did make them go away. Just watching now to see how long they stay gone.
78053,"These I put them last year and they were still present in my garden. Just picked them and threw them. Not sure what the contents are, and even if it is a slow release these are supposed to make the tomato plants healthier. Did not see anything....not buying them anymore."
78054,"Archer in the 4th is just awesome! Escapism at its best. This series only flaw is one day it will be cancelled and/or the writers will run out of material. The voices are casted very well. I have never been distracted by anything with this series. Archer is well directed, drawn and voiced. What more can I say? I downloaded the episodes that interest me and it seems that you need not have seen all in order to follow the series.Along with the Venture Brothers, Archer is worth following for good laughs! I really think it out class much of what is shown on tv with &#8220;live&#34; actors.Anyway, watch an episode or trailer. You will not be disappointed."
78055,"Well, it does what it was designed for. I haven't noticed any difference in durability between the original one that came from the dealership (but it's sure is cheaper to replace it yourself ;-) ). Good product. Changing it was a breeze."
78056,This kit cleans strings body and conditions the fretboard. It's got everything you need for your high end guitar maintenance.
78057,"As axel bearing grease, this is the best. I used it on 3 trailers 10 wheels) with grease hubs - and it took three tubes total and really made a difference. When the hubs get hot this does not melt and run out."
78058,My favorite show on TV right now. Glad I was able to view via Amazon Prime on a next day basis as I don't have live TV.
78059,I love the Agatha Christie's Poirot Series for season 11. David Suchet is such a marvelous actor and his portrayal of Poirot is wonderful. I love to be able to stream the series whenever I am ready to watch it. I highly recommend this series and streaming video.
78060,"I've been using this for roughly a year now, and it works fine.  It feels a bit cheap, but then it IS cheap.  It's not as easy to move as a spring-loaded capo, but it's also much lower profile.  Overall, I like it and it's certainly worth the (minimal) price."
78061,great value. We have had our RV trailer for 2 years and have been looking for a product to help stop the movement while parked. This made a huge difference. the price was the best we found.
78062,"Season 1 was rather mediocre, but still watchable.  Season 2 is just plain dumb.  Nothing is holding my interest any more and I've watched my last episode."
78063,"J.J. Abrams' Star Trek is one of the most exciting Trek films since Wrath of Khan and the Search for Spock. Years after a Romulan attack that killed his father, a thrill seeking farm boy, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) joins Star Fleet. He doesn't take it seriously and cheats on a test. Which doesn't impress Spock (Zachary Quinto) much since he's all for going by the rules. They don't get along, but a Romulan attack on the Enterprise they're on might just be enough to force them to work together.I really enjoyed this movie. The cast was a lot of fun and everyone did a good job in their roles. I was surprised how well Karl Urban played Bones. He wouldn't have been my first choice for the role either. Zachary Quinto comfortably plays Spock as well and plays the part perfectly. While Chris Pine is more of a gun-ho Kirk than I'm used to,. He is perfectly cocky as him though. Zoe Saldana wasn't bad as Uhura but my only problem with the movie is how she was used. I mean, I don't remember a Spock, Kirk and Uhura love triangle in the original series or movies lol. Spock making-out with her just felt wrong. But I was still entertained by the look on Kirk's face witnessing it.I'm not used to a Star Trek film where Spock is a stud or one with some bad language either. While  the space battles were a bit better in previous films. I still found a lot of the film exciting and fun though. Which is something I haven't felt watching a Star Trek film in awhile. Especially not the last 2 Trek films."
78064,"Didn't think I'd be compelled to review something like a guitar pick, but the Dunlop Ultex has really impressed me thus far.  I use the .60 thickness, which is equivalent to the orange plastic Dunlop pick.  The orange pick is my favorite for acoustic and most electric playing, but they do wear down and fray on the edges, and have a little more friction that I'd like.This Ultex seems very resistant to wear and has surprisingly little drag over the string.  I find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold.  It gives just enough to use for smooth strumming, while being rigid enough for individual notes.Some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use.  If that turns out to be a problem, I might reconsider my review.  But out of the box, they perform as well as any pick I have used!"
78065,Not sure why this show wasn't renewed after 3 seasons. I love the action and suspense and look into deception.
78066,"Ok, so someone has read Anne Rice. This is good. There was potential here to create something interesting and provocative.But no.Where do these writers come from and how old are they? And who is directing?That is what is truly scary about this.A few pretty faces but you really need to be a 15 year old who thinks the Twilight series is good literature.If you are - you will love this.If not, more than 20 minutes is painful."
78067,"I bought two of these to put in my shop in order to keep the batteries charged on my 4-wheeler and mower. Cold weather has a bad effect on batteries when they are not utilized for awhile,so these always keep the batteries charged and helps to prolong their life too. I've also got a charger made by Duracell. These are made by Schumacher. Both work just as advertised, but I bought these because I have had some experience in the past with the Schumacher products and have been well satisfied with their services. I didn't know they made these type chargers till I ran across these, so I decided to give them a try. So far-so good."
78068,"Update: my partner has since employed this as a macbook sleeve. Not its intended use, but effective, so I'm bumping it up a star.The idea here is that this organizer/bag's shoulder strap (which is attached at the top of the bag on one end and the side of the bag on the other, to better wrap around a car seat) slips over your passenger seat, so that that your bag can be conveniently accessed while you drive. The problem is that the bag is just too small to be useful outside of the car. . The bag itself is essentially flat and padded like a laptop sleeve--and not much larger--a mere 11"" tall x 15"" wide, and less than an inch deep inside at the bottom.The exterior pockets do have deep gussets--but not on the bottom--so what they hold has to be either small or flat as well, unless you never intend to remove it from the car (and that's the whole point, right?), because if you put much inside it won't close. The bottle pocket alone is gusseted on two sides, so it will hold a large bottle, and it does have a nice strap near the top, so you can cinch your bottle in when you're on the go or loosen it for when you're in the car.The other exterior pockets--two essentially flat pockets layered atop one another--have a gusset only on one side, which means they can't hold much, but that it is easy to access what's inside--this is a great feature when you're rummaging around in a pocket while you're driving. The layer between the pockets is stabilized with the same padding of the main bag, which also means the pockets stay upright and distinct, another nice feature. The exterior pockets are the best part of the bag, and why it gets 2 stars instead of 1.If it were advertised solely as a 3-pocket auto caddy--and the price were correspondingly lower--I would give this bag higher marks. Like all Thule products (I own 4 other Thule organizers between our two cars), it is very well made and will stand up to much abuse. But unless all you need to hold is a laptop or a few magazines or papers, it's virtually useless as bag (much less as a diaper/toy bag, as suggested--you could maybe fit 3 small diapers, laying flat and side by side, or a few children's books or happy meal toys; forget anything else).Thule typically makes very sturdy, clever car organizers, but this bag has an identity crisis. It should either be simply a caddy that stays in the car, and have an extra strap to secure the bottom as well (the laptop sleeve portion would be okay for mail or maps, etc.--although who uses maps anymore?)--or it should be deeper with a boxed bottom on both the main bag section and pockets, like a messenger bag, so it's roomy and useful outside of the car, as well. As it is, it's missing the mark both ways.[For the record, I received this bag from Vine for review. Both the Vine description and the product packaging pitch it more as a bag--the box even shows it slung over the shoulder, messenger-bag style. However, the regular Amazon listing makes it sound more like a simple car organizer. Based on the packaging and the price--$10-15 more than the typical small Thule car organizer--I'm assuming the intention really is a dual-purpose bag designed for easy car access/organization, not simply a car organizer, and I'm reviewing it based on that assumption.]"
78069,"If City of Heroes is a guide, Arrow is an average super hero soap opera. There are pretty high production values and a diverse supporting cast but for the most part Arrow is just a paint by numbers dramaction series. Nothing terrible about that but don't expect more.The show features outright theft of themes from The Dark Knight movie series and slightly altered genre cliches, melodrama performed by the star and his apparent love interest obviously not chosen primarily for the likelihood of their winning Emmys, and fight scenes that seem to owe more to enthusiastic editing than choreography or stunts.Bottom line: if you think Smallville would have been better with more male shirtlessness Arrow may be exactly what you are looking for. If not move along. There's nothing to see here."
78070,"Really the only good option for high temp engine and exhaust use. Worth the money, will last forever. I use it on exhaust sensor threads and spark plugs with no issue."
78071,"I found this entire series worthy of a 5. Entertaining, and with imagination, and I did not want it to end."
78072,Received product quickly. Opened immediatly and proceeded to install. Put some and and car started cooling as expected. At about 4.50/can it was a great value compared to purchasing at almost 10.00 at the 'W' store or a big box auto parts place. Buy with confidence.
78073,"These wash cloths are so great and works perfectly with the product they are intended to work with. They are so soft, good absorbents, and smooths the car the way they should.Basically, I got a the Spray-On Speed Shine Kit, and was impressed, so I got more towels. I think that should be reason enough that this product is great.Verdict: I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
78074,I have been using this product for about a year and have been pleased with the results.  I have recommended it to other campers and they are using it also.
78075,"It's sturdy, well made and it really takes care of branches up to 1 inch. The handles are very comfortable and this shear makes extremely easy to reach all branches at all angles. I agree with the reviewer that mentions that it's &#34;hand-neutral&#34;. I'm left-handed, and this was the most comfortable pruner I've ever used."
78076,"Good quality, strong and excellent finish. Nicely priced. A foot rest will help you maintain a good posture while playing, a must for classical players."
78077,Arrived promptly as promised. Seems to be OK. Just getting tired of everything coming from CHINA. I think that country of origin should be required in the description.
78078,"I have no opinion of the video, since I couldn't get it to play on my pc.  sorry!  I'm still trying to resolve whether it was a wireless issue, a spooling issue, or a video streaming issue."
78079,"Wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this, but it is like an ""E"" ticket at Disneyland and am glad I gave it a chance.Look forward to watching Season 4 once the price comes down some on Amazon or it comes to Amazon Prime."
78080,"I really enjoy using this product.  I apply after cleaning and claying.  Honestly, I don't know if this product is any better then my 3M products, but the 3M doesn't smell as good as this one!"
78081,"I should have rented this confused, disjointed hodge-podge from Netflix, rather than having wasted the miniscule amount it cost me to purchase from Costco.Utter junk!  Although ""trooper"" me had to stick it out to the very end, hoping for a simulacrum of improvement.Which never manifested."
78082,"I bought these bulbs as I saw it had good reviews. I installed a pair on my TSX's license plate and it looks great - the white LED light makes the license plate more visible. I then installed the othe pair on my MDX's trunk and it looks great as well. One thing though - if you install them and they don't light up, just uninstall, rotate and install again. Very happy with this purchase."
78083,"Perhaps being an Army Brat and remembering the 'stories' of WWII makes this all the more poignant. To listen to these men recount their memories is to recognize the bonds formed during combat. Friendship and trust that has remained through the years and been passed on to their children and grandchildren. Their training began in Georgia and saw them through places that have been immortalized in  films . . . 'A Bridge Too Far?' Yes, Operation Market Garden was a reality for these men. Their stories  allow one to follow their path from army training,  airborne training at Ft. Benning,  Georgia,  even more training in England, their landing at Normandy, and finally 'back home.' These men should be listened to for they have so much to share. The narrative is well done, includes interviews and photographs. Listen, if you will, and remember!7 January 2014: Now that I've viewed other Tim Gray Amazon instant videos, I decided to view this one again. The members of 'Easy Company' certainly had a great deal to contribute to the understanding of other WWII serieses. A venture into the past with this 'Band of Brothers!'"
78084,Squirrels learned in a few days how to get around this.  I wasted my money but you don't have to.
78085,A string winder and cutter ! This is a tool to carry in your guitar case at all times ! It even has a peg puller for people who have pegs on their acoustic guitars. Great quality product...I will buy another one for my uncle who performs weekly.
78086,Pretty good entertainment ....The characters really grown on you...Highly recommended ...real life situations as far as the politics of doing any business...
78087,"Season  3 is becoming more of a  science fiction show, than the police procedural it was during the first two seasons.  With the storyline changes in episode one, they seem to finally be going in the direction that it should be about. The writers seem to have a firm grasp on what ultimate resolution of the series will be. I hope the ratings stay up and we have a chance to see the end result."
78088,"There are a few brief sequences that work, but mostly this is just very very tired stuff.  No new light is shed on the issue.  The take of ""this is how the issue has affected me personally"" seems contrived.  The issue is better covered elsewhere (not least in realistic fiction like ""The Wire"" and ""The Corner"").  There's no value here."
78089,"I love this!! Cool, many possible turns of events.  GREAT acting, plot development, character development and ending.  Love it.  I can't wait for more episodes! Kudos!!!!"
78090,I likem all but the swamp ledginShelby is the best glad he got his own show lol ha ha ha
78091,"By third season I think that I was just along for the ride, Heroes always &#34;looked&#34; good but always fell short of its potential, at least this one rises above what Season Two was turning itself into. If you like scifi / fantasy you can find some good bits here, but the &#34;bargain bin&#34; might still be the way to go. My set advertises &#34;over 20 hours of bonus features&#34;- that would be the best reason to watch this season ( and even that doesn't explain dropping so many second season characters like Claire's flying boyfriend)."
78092,"When rating season one, I said I did not think there were addition episodes, but here they are. They are just as good, and as well acted as season one. I highly recommend this series. It is gritty, well presented, and very well acted."
78093,"I love this grill brush...it makes my last grill brush look like a toy!The brush is very light, but tough as can be. After I cook, while the grill is still hot, I used this brush to clean...I could not believe how much came off and how quickly. It also got into places I could not get into with my old grill brush.m cleaning was a snap, but be careful as these bristles are sharp.Whenever I fire up my grill, and I always re brush it before I cook, just to be sure everything was off the grill. This time when I did that, there was nothing to clean, as I got it all off the night before after cooking! That was a first.This really is a great tool that I will be using all summer!"
78094,"I can't speak for the taste, but there hasn't been a shortage of birds (and squirrels!) stopping by the feeder.The easy pour spout on the bag makes it so much easier to pour without having to use a funnel, cup or other plastic pouring device. The bag was just big enough for 2 fills of the feeder with a little left over.The one thing I noticed was there are no corn or sunflower fillers in these bags. It was berries seeds of all sizes and no sticks or other debris."
78095,Its so slimy and gouy and nasty and icky!  I love using this grease on anything and everything; even me!!!!
78096,"The New Jersey Housewives have managed to pull it together and actually attempt to get some resolution to their differences.  They haven't always shown their true colors quite so brightly as they have done this year.  None of the cast is pristine or always sincere as shown through their words and actions.  However, this year, they have managed to  be authentic and show their true nature.  Manipulation, fighting, gossiping, tweeting, hugging, crying, laughing and even counseling have all been part of this season.  They even manage to turn a retreat in to a true picture of their actual personalities.  Confrontation has always been their style.  However, this year each cast member shows their own unique personalities in the midst of their own self created chaos. Each person shows their true colors and &#34;owns&#34; it.  Viewers may not like their style but at last we have gotten to know who they really are which is a surprising twist for a reality show.  No one will be bored or disappointed with New Jersey Real Housewives, 5th Season.  There is a light at the end of their twisted tunnel that actually helps us understand what it really is like to be in their group.  After all, Isn't that what we really wanted when we watched the show? A honest show about real people with a lot of excitement and drama. This year, you really get to actually see what was always behind the curtain."
78097,"The premise sounded good, and the story line for the premiere was also very good, but I find the needless nudity that was in the premier and then again in the second episode made me decide I didn't want to watch this series after all.  It and coarse language are always a sign of a weak script.  When the writing is good, these elements are unneeded.  I was very disappointed."
78098,This power supply is great for me. I attached it underneath my Pedal train and it works great. The 2 knobs you see on it can &#34;Sag&#34; the power to be less voltage. You can get your pedal to sound as if it has a dying battery in it.
78099,I bought this to change the oil on my 2005 Saturn Vue (2.2L). Makes changing the filter a breeze. I highly recommend this for anyone with a 2.2L Ecotech motor.
78100,"I think it is great that they follow around this special needs child. Obviously he is retarded. Wait, my wife looking over my shoulder said the word retarded is offensive... well I just told her that the idea of saying retarded as an offensive word is retarded. WTF she just hit me. okay that is the last straw, I want out of this abusive marriage."
78101,It's really cool to see all the competition using so many different weapons under so many different conditions.  I much prefer the team competitions where they are paired up while competing...adds another dimension to the enjoyment and you get to see who is a team player vs. lone wolf.
78102,"Here' the winning formula:The Doctor + Amy/Rory + the TARDIS = excitement, originality, variety, emotions, suspense, River and viewer happiness & satisfaction.Trust me, I'm the Poppy!"
78103,I am a pure city girl and for some reason this reality show I love!!! I love each person on the show and the old fashion moral and values the parents to the children uphold till this day knowing and having the knowledge that their son's and wives are changing with the times... including their children... and I love the end of each show how they always pray about the togetherness of the family  ... no matter what they went thru that day...
78104,My x-wife wanted to see it so we got the chips and dips and gave it a go. Nice scenery and thrilling tale. Excellent gladiator fights. Cool volcano explosions and computer graphics work.
78105,"Needed something powerful for the boat at the dock, this works great and has a strong pressure and control! Much recommended!"
78106,"Watching the ""Blacklist"", it was like watching a complete alternate version of the ""Silence of the Lamb.""  Upon the characters first meeting one another - Raymond & Liz, I swear it was like watching Agt. Starling meeting Hannibal for the first time, but alternates.  Just like Hannibal attacked Starling's bag and shoes, Raymond attacks Liz's past. Alternate I tell ya; Liz [Character] has shown that she can wear her emotions on her sleeve while Raymond [Character]is totally refined, like the finer things in life: pricey hotels, good food, good wine.Overall, I thought introducing the first Pilot ""Chosen One"" was pretty good. The Blacklist is really about an overly brilliant, egotistical criminal who's fascinated with an up & coming FBI Profiler.  Perhaps their fates were connected in the past in an all too predictable ending.  I'll willing to purchase a couple more episodes to see where the series leads.  I like the chemistry between the two lead characters, plus --- seems like things are definitely not what they appear to be.I recommend this series... even though it does remind me of SOTL, it's still worth watching if you're into intrigue, mystery, etc."
78107,"This product is designed to capture tiny mice. Mice around where i am are not giant, but not tiny mice. I guess your average mouse is not tiny. It can catch an average sized mouse, but the noise and movement of the mouse inside stops any other mouse from being caught. And it is not big enough to catch large mice (not rats which is definitely not possible)"
78108,"I bought the Castrol Transmax Import in the case and didn't realize that within the case was a bag and a pull out drain spout.  I purchased this because the lowest cost per quart price.  I like the product, I use it in my Honda and Toyota vehicles.  It is more work for me to use in this form but it was my mistake, I will pay a bit more next time, either a gallon container or regular quart size.  For now, I am filling a quart bottle from this and transferring the quart bottle one at a time to my transmissions.UDPATE 10/26/13: Just a little update about my experience with the 6 gallon box size.  As I stated above, I have been transferring to a Castrol Transmax quart and filling my transmission in my cars.  One thing I noticed is because the Castrol quart contaniners are black AND the Transmax is red, it is very hard to see the level as I fill in the quart container.  Compared to standard engine oil quarts which one can easily see on the side of the container where the level of oil is in the container, I need a strong light from above so I can peak into the Castrol quart containers.  Not a big deal except for an occassional overfilling, but just a FYI for others who are planning on ordering the box size.My future plan is to maybe continue buying this box if it still nets me the lowest $/quart and then use a funnel and clean gallon container, like milk or vinegar container to transfer.  Mark lines for different quart levels on the container.  This will give me the best of both worlds, best quart value AND easy and clean transfers.I also looked into what I paid back on 5/13 and for everyone's reference, it was $101 ($4.20 per quart).Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
78109,This was my least favorite of all the pilots I viewed. The tech jargon felt overwhelming. The love interest story felt forced to attract the women. I didnt really care if they ended up getting Ed Begley Jr's help or not.This show just wasnt for me.
78110,Great season. This is one of the rare shows that just keep getting better. This season is all about bringing down Henry.
78111,"I've head from various reviews that it's just not the same as the 'old' formulation. Far as I can tell, it works as it always has. i've used this stuff for forty years, and it's good stuff."
78112,Please don't waste your money and our time. Move on to a better story. This show is horrible and can't get any better.
78113,"This thing is solid! It is not a bent piece of steel like some other ones, it is a solid cast piece and is very heavy. I've towed lifted 3/4 ton trucks out of mud pits and through trails with it with no signs of wear. The powdercoat finish hasn't chipped after over a year and there's been no rust (even living in New England) and the pin turns easily.The only complaint I have is that the semi gloss finish has lost it's luster on the top where the sun hits it. It is still perfectly functional but doesn't look as nice.It does run small but I haven't experienced any rattling, My hitch was a little rusted so this was the best option for me."
78114,Pros:- Price point- Does the job in the descriptionCons:- Shielding of USB cable is abysmal; very susceptible to interference (could work if there is minimal circuitry around where you use it)- Cheap plastic construction
78115,"This little bait station is very easy to use, just open the box and it's ready.  The one thing I didn't like was that when I opened the box, little particles of the bait came out, and this stuff is poison!  There was bait on my hands and on my counter.  I quickly washed my hands and the counter.  My husband put it in a shed where we keep corn that we feed to deer.  We are hoping this will help eliminate the mouse problem."
78116,This show continues to be enjoying to watch.  Some of the old cast leave and new cast members join the show.  It still is a good and interesting season.
78117,"There's a long checklist of things you should do before evening buying this item. I'll go through some but do urge stringent research before committing to this product way over and above my review.1) Do you even need protection? Put a few thousand miles on the car per year or the paint is already chipped. Then the answer is probably no.2) Is it worth the massive extra expense of going for a professional solution foregoing one at this price point? If your car is worth fifty grand plus then I would say so.3) Are you prepared for a more matte, cloudy finish on the front of your car? If not then no clear bra solution is for you and you should look for something else.4) Are you experienced with spray painting, do you know how much or how little to apply? If not then this shouldn't be your first attempt.5) Were you aware that this is a temporary solution that requires almost yearly attention? If not are you okay with that?6)Arre you able to let the product acclimatize in fair temperature of 65 or so then work at that temp? Too hot it won't work, too cold it really won't work.Okay with that out of the way the reason I mention all this is due to the current negative reviews. It isn't for motorcycles, it isn't for all over body protection, it WILL dull the area it is protecting, it requires a nice temp to use, it helps if you're comfortable with spraying, prep work done right is essential etc. You can't just shake the can and get going.I applied this, based on the above points, to my recent Yaris's front bumper and tiny hood. And you know it looks great, it works great and I'm happy that on a car worth less than ten grand I didn't have to outlay five hundred plus on professional stuff nor did I have to settle for a plastic black bra. My car looks great and is very well protected which for the price is no bad thing.Yes, I could point a finger at 3M for seemingly over-stressing the simplicity but some personal responsibility must also be applied, especially those here who attempted to do this in extremely low temperatures due to the time of year.Please go in prepared to work before your purchase and work during the installation. Follow the manufacturer's rules and be patient. Read up on other's experiences and set a few hours aside. For less than a valentine's night out you could have a very well protected car that looks great.Very pleased with this system and if you look around you may find just how expensive an alternative clear bra solution is. Good luck."
78118,"I am editing my earlier review.  I bought 2 of these about 6 months ago.  One works just fine, no problems whatsoever, I use it on every gig and at home.  The other has some kind of short in it.  It drains batteries almost overnight.  When I take the batteries out, no problem.  Tunes just fine, but I am sure over time the battery harness will break as it is made of flimsy plastic materials that surely will not stand this kind of test.I contacted Snark and Marcy, their customer service rep, sent me a new one free of charge even though the tuner was out of warranty.  Excellent customer service!  They have earned my loyalty even if their products are not perfect because their service is!I will edit this review later if the replacement turns out not to work perfectly."
78119,"So glad I found these,  three sides,  much easier for me to hold,  thin is in!  As a beginner these make much more comfortable."
78120,I usually use the Pro Steels (by D'Addario)  but these sound and fit nicely with my Squire Fender P Bass. Amazon seems to have great prices and it's nice to have them delivered too.
78121,"I bought this to provide supplemental light to my Bonsai and it works perfect for what I needed. The clamp is very strong and the fixture easily clips on securely and holds the light in place. Other reviewers have mentioned the light gets hot. I disagree a bit, the light does get fairly warm but not too hot. I have the light 13&#34; from my Bonsai plant and the warmth is hardly felt. The housing for the bulb gets the hottest but I really do not think it is much of an issue for me. I would not place the light near a curtain or blinds but I would not say it gets overly hot.+ Warm Color Light, Not Bright White Like Florescent bulbs+ Very Strong Clamp+ On/Off Switch+ Rotates/Twists/Adjusts to Many Positions+ Easily Replace Bulb+ Price+ Great Supplemental Light Source- Would be nice if the On/Off switch were on the cord not the housing_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this light to a friend. The further away the light is placed, the wider the angle of light allowing for multiple plants under the light. I have several plants under it and they are all doing very well. I just put two screws into a stud on the wall and then hooked the clamp to the screws. I am very confident the light is secure. I like that if/when the bulb goes out I can buy the same bulb or try something else."
78122,"I have had ""The Executioner"" for a few months and love it. No matter how well I try to keep them out, flies inevitably make it into my home to my despair. Now when I see a fly I jump up and take it down quickly without leaving a mess to wipe off the wall, floor, counter, or worse yet the table. Ever find yourself swinging a traditional fly swatter wildy and not know if you actually got it or not? The bright blue spark and loud pop provides instant feedback that I got the fly in mid air! No more wondering if I got it or not. Works great, great price, no mess, cannot go wrong here.+ Price+ Effectiveness (though rarely the fly will and not die on the first zap)+ ON button must be held to operate (can set it down and not worry about it being left on for the cat to step on)+ No Mess+ Blue spark and ""pop""+ Works on other insects- Occasionally does not totally kill a fly but usually leaves them incapacitated and unable to fly_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend looking to get rid of flys without having to clean up a mess. The only thing that could be better is having one in each hand! Works great! I use ""The Exectioner"" and then just a quick vacuum attachement to get them off the floor. Super easy and clean."
78123,"love the show --we watch it and have a blast,  in this case dorks are wild.  keep up the good work"
78124,I have watched this show from the beginning and hate that this is its last season.  The story ended strangely.  But well worth watching.
78125,"This is a great clay bar kit at a good price. It comes with everything you'll need. 2 clay bars should be sufficient if you've never clay bar'd your car before, 1 is enough if you do so periodically (1-2 years). Awesome super smooth finish on your car removes pitted particulate and some swirls, but it does require good amount of elbow grease for great results!The application spray has this nice cinnamon scent to it, but I still don't think that that means it's good for you to keep inhaling it."
78126,"This is a very nice microphone for the money and for general voice over work.I would not use this mic for professional singing, just spoken word.I have many microphones, and this compares to the $50. range mics."
78127,"As I do my own oil changes, I wanted to reduce amount of times I have to change oil by utilizing Synthetic Oil (I go for fully synthetic Mobil1 or Pennzoil) and I am able to accomplish it in conjunction with this filter. It was great, I never had any problems, and I get extra time now to do other tasks other than doing a yet another oil change."
78128,"well what can I say.  it takes a signal and splits it 4 ways offering output at HP level. genius.  I bought it for my church since we're going the HP monitoring route and this was my best bet against the super over priced shure/senheiser/audio technica overpriced systems. I paired this up with the MA400 and it works great. hook up an xlr straight from the DI and voila, you got both inputs with separate control. like I said. genius."
78129,"Good acting and fast moving plot are highlights, but the abundance of characters add an element of confusion at times.  Overall an entertaining series."
78130,"Once I read about the Bugera B5, I knew I wanted one.  Why futz with tube-like effects when you can have real, live tubes -- two in fact!  Only five Watts, yes, but that's still enough to fill a room.  But it's the extras that cinch the deal: this is built like a brick house -- you can jump up and down on it if you want to.  It has an internal cable for the speaker, so you can easily plug in a different cabinet.  Comes with built-in reverb.  Headphone jack standard.  Best of all: an attenuator, so you can get the cranked sound even at low volume levels.  Easily upgradeable -- I put new tubes and speaker into mine, though I probably didn't have to.  A small but effective little amp.Edit: I had modded my Bugera with a Jensen MOD-8 and used it for bass, but recently I found a source for Celestion Super 8 drivers and popped one of those in.  Amazing low-end output for such a small cab!"
78131,i love this led light i got me another one i did not install just connected it to my battery real quick at night and it showed real good no dislikes
78132,Joey (Jason Statham) an ex-Special Forces officer who could not handle it any more goes homeless and drinks to dull the killing machine he was turned into. One day his girlfriend is abducted and pressed into servicing.He has the opportunity to become the man he was for the summer. With the help of a soup-kitchen num Cristina (Agata Buzek) that has issues of her own he plans to track down and dispatch a bad guy.The unique side to this movie is not the formula but the execution. We also have the Joe and Cristina is not the driven snow type themselves.
78133,You must make sure that the snakes are away from the house then put this down and the snakes will stay away. We have some garter snakes that like to try and get into our foundation. We made sure that they had left and put down the barrier and they did not cross it. We had used this once before and it prevented them from finding a nesting place in our house for the winter. I have closed the holes I could find that I thought they were getting in but this kept them from trying and they found their winter spot out in the yard somewhere.
78134,"I hate to gripe about this purchase as I enjoyed releasing the few ladybugs that I did receive. Suffice it to say that I hand-released most of these little ladies and was done in under an hour. There were a number of ladybug corpses, but still only about 100 or so. I don't know what this company is doing when it comes to parceling out these bugs, but they need to find a new method.As for what the bugs did after they were released, well that isn't the company's fault. They do tend to wander off. Still, I keep seeing ladybugs near the release location and there were only about 100 of them to begin with. I feel like the few bugs hanging aroundI'd make a stink about being ripped off if I thought 10 bucks was worth the aggro. Still, this is definitely a case of ""buyer beware"". Go try your local nursery for bugs if you need them, that way you'll be able to see what you're getting before you shell out the money."
78135,"The description is of the Expandable Window Planter made me believe it would be suitable for a window herb garden.  It is much too small for that purpose.  The dimensions are liliputian: there are four boxes on the bottom row measuring 3"" x 3"" and a tad over 2"" in depth. The top box is 3"" X 6"" but also only 2"" deep.  You might use it to start plants, or for bushier herbs such as dill, but your basil will not thrive in such cramped conditions.I wasn't crazy about the greenish color either. In the description, it appers more of a silvery white, slightly antiqued.  I gave mine a quick spray painting (fire engine red...might as well go for broke and it matches the microwave.)  I did find some small, square pots at a local nursery that are a perfect fit; however, watering is going to be a chore.  There is no drainage in the little squares, although one may drill holes in each segment for this purpose. The only problem is, this wood doesn't look like it will stand up to much soaking.  That means every time you water, the little pots will have to be removed and replaced after they have sort of dried out.  You can also use the little plastic liners that are provided to protect the wood from residual leaking.I'm not a born gardener. I learn by trial and (mostly) error. My lettuce has never made it past a few tiny leaves breaking through the dirt before the slug thugs muscle in and eat it all up. My tomatoes are usually a big success, but it's a no holds barred battle with the gypsy moths, the caterpillars and my own greed (fried green tomatoes!).  The only thing I can grow with ease is zucchini, and I only grow that because you can't not grow zucchini and I need some results after investing hours of hard labor and most of my pathetic savings. Even the slugs won't touch those things.Despite my shortcomings as a gardener, I'm pretty good with herbs and right now, everything grows on my patio.  I have to schlep out there whenever I need some cilantro or a bit of dill. If you are stirring your gravy, watching the broiler so the chops don't catch fire again, and trying to shoo the cat out of the salad bowl, this is not always convenient.  I do have a couple of pots of herbs on the window sill over the sink, but they are forever being slept on, gnawed at or knocked over by the cats and I don't think they are fit for human consumption.  On the other hand, most of my food isn't either, so it sort of works out.  But if you are looking for an indoor herb garden, keep looking.  This is only marginally useful for that dedicated gardner who grows from seed and wants to watch the babies grow into sprouts. Me, I kill full grown plants.  Growing from seed would be an act of vegetabl cruelty."
78136,Love the story line.  I am already regretting that this is the only season though that is available I have a feeling it is going to leave me hanging.
78137,"I think the idea of this is greatand deserves 5 stars. It would make a great gift, especially to abeginning gardener. I really like the selection of vegetables andherbs that it includes. It is a perfect assortment. It would have beennice if the package or product page contained some pictures for ideason arranging the pods in a container and maybe a picture of a fullsize garden using this set of pods. It seemed like there could havebeen a few more helpful tips, but maybe there really isn't much to add."
78138,"I bought this on a whim. I was pretty satisfied with the extra heavy picks I was using, but wanted something with more grip. These picks have a logo and the company name molded in, which gives purchase to you pickin fingers to hold on to the pick. This seems to be a perfect thickness for some of my guitars that have silk and steel strings. With the xtra heavy picks I was losing what little treble these strings had. With this little purple wonder I got my treble back and still had great control for playing fast or playing hard.I like them so much I bought another hundred just in case the purple pick monster eats all my other picks.Its a great pick, its delrin or whatever(delflex) generic name they give it to avoid trademark issues, but its the best plastic for picks in my book. The tone is superb and the ease of holding is wonderful. I keep a couple of these in all my guitar cases.I recommend these if you enjoy playing guitar or just enjoy owning things that are purple colored. They don't taste like grapes however."
78139,Suits highlights the clever nature of high end attorneys and their devil may care attitude. The main two main characters yield and wheel a shared Jurist Doctorate at clients spraying collaterally damage in the process of winning at all costs.  Billable hours never seem to be portrayed as they are in real life but the acting and the writing place this show heads and tails above most.  This one gives Netflix's House of Cards a run for it's money.
78140,"Use this and a cheap drill to set my trailer stabilizers.  Thanks to this cool little gadget, I can have all four set in less than three minutes.  Considering that I want to spend less time setting up the trailer and more time enjoying it, this tool is a great addition to my trailer tool box."
78141,This is the first season I've used but so far I like the way it runs.  The six inch spacing is good for a great variety of plants.  Beans for instance.  Not quite close enough for carrots but it's good for a bunch of things in the garden.  If it plugs up for next season - I will report.
78142,"Every time I have my tires rotated, it ends up with a selection of mismatched valve caps.  I don't much care exactly what the caps look like, but something in me wants them to match.  Yah ... I'm the guy who likes all the presidents facing the same way in my wallet.  A little weird but harmless. This will be nice.  If I get the car back with a mismatch, I can just pull one from my bag and replace it.  Also, some idiot stole an ordinary plastic cap from my motorcycle.  With these I can make them match again."
78143,"One of my friends received this as a gift to use for tailgating parties.  After a few uses, he decided it took to long to cool off, was to hard to clean and had put it back in the box with the intention of setting it out with the trash!  Fortunately before he did, he saw me looking at it on this website and asked if I planned on buying it.  I said yes and he said don't because he had one that he was going to throw away.  If I didn't mind it being used and a little rusty, I could have his.  I took it.  It was rusted but I scrubbed it, oiled all the parts, and seasoned it in the oven (it was still cold outside so I couldn't fire it up)!This little grill came in so handy when we bought another house in the spring and removed the stove to make way for the new one. I cooked on it everyday.  What my friend found as a disadvantage, I found as an advantage, it stays hot for a long time!I grilled everything, half smokes, kabobs, burgers, chicken, veggies, fish, etc. . . and nothing stuck!  I also grilled ribs on it.  I sliced them into individual ribs, placed them on the grill, and covered them with foil (crimped the foil around the rack with tongs). They turned out really good. I used my little cast iron skillet on top of the rack to scramble eggs, and blacken steaks (lots of coals needed for that).The grill is very durable and as long as it is properly taken care of will provide many years of grilling pleasure!  I really like it because the grill rack can be put in the sink for easy clean up and as long as it's properly seasoned, I don't have to worry about my food sticking to it.I also have a 22"" weber kettle grill that I use when I want to grill a lot of food or large items.  If I don't, I set this one inside of it on the grate and use it instead.  This is an excellent grill for a small household, and I recommend it over the other hibachi type grills.  It's great for camping but keep in mind that since it's cast iron it takes a long time to cool down, so start grillin' early!"
78144,"I had this leak out the front of my 5 speed tranny and BillyBob's garage said it would cost me $600 for labor to install a 5 dollar oil seal. I said F that. Well, then I saw this guy on YouTube named Val Kilmer or something trying to peddle this leak stop stuff. Well, I wasn't buying it at first, but then I said to myself what the heck it's only a few bucks compared to what Billybob was trying to charge me. So, I tried it and dang if it didn't work. My tranny stopped leaking after I drove it for only a half hour. No drips on the garage floor. It works!"
78145,"This seems okay, but it was sort of fussy to use. Having them want you to spread it and then water it seemed like a pain, so I'll admit that I kinda put it out before a rain shower was supposed to hit and figured I'd let nature take care of the watering. I'm not really sure if that was a good idea or not, but this seems like it's temporarily done okay for discouraging the critters from hanging out."
78146,"I hung this new antique bottle style hummingbird feeder yesterday, and already have a few of the little guys hanging around.  I got the red bottle so it would be noticed right away, and it was! The bottle holds about 3 cups of nectar. I filled it with clear nectar, and it is difficult to see the level of the fluid in the dark red bottle, but I'll manage!  The Perky Pet brand makes a lot of nice feeders, but the best thing about this one is the ability to clean the two bottom sections. The bottle screws into the plastic bottom, with the metal top part with flowers in between. Other feeders have a one piece bottom that is impossible to clean properly. My other Perky Pet feeder has a ring around the bottom so the birds can perch while drinking, and I thought that with this new one they would have to hover, but there is a raised rolled rim around the edge that is perfect.  It is a very elegant looking and attractive hummingbird feeder."
78147,Stopped 15 minutes into the movie.  This movie wasn't so bad as it was irratating. The quips from the Satellite of Love crew didn't make up for it.  There is a vast differance between a bad movie and a bad movie that is worthy of the MST treatment.
78148,love Doctor Who....love this episode.  recommended for any fan of the show.  Doctor Who?  that is the quesiton on everyone's mind.
78149,"These are good chocks.  I was disaaapinted, however, to find that one of the set I received had errant cut on the base, where the rubber was trimmed at the factory.  I had to return them.Unlike other Race Ramp products these are NOT made in USA.  They are NOT marked with the country of origin. They are nearly identical to the ones selling at $8.99 each at my local Northern Tools store. Those are marked made somewhere in Asia.  I don't recall which country.  That means I can get a set of 4 for under $36.  The mold numbers inside the bottom cavity are the same, and the dimensions and weight are the same.  Yes, as another reviewer stated, they are hollow but heavy rubber.The only difference between these and the Buyers' were shallow slits cut into the bottom running parallel to the car axles in their installed position.  I'm not sure that they help very much and are worth the extra dollars.  I gave a set of four of the Buyers to a friend for his boat trailer a couple of Christmases, ago.  They are quite heavy work very well.If you likee to see these, just go to either Northern or Tractor Supply.  They are heavu and work well, but I'd wouldn't pay over $20 more for the Race Ramps label or the slits on the bottom.For my Race Ramps to check the tires on the ramps, I'll get the $3.24 each yellow Camcos lightweight plastic ones that, to my surprise, ARE Made in USA.  Since the Race Ramps material is a little flexible, I see no problems with the cheapies working just as well.On concrete, however, the Buyers are a better deal."
78150,"This was a good Project Runway like show.  This time the host is Tim Gunn. He believes strongly in mentoring so that is the basis of his show. The three mentors are PR alums, Anya, Mondo, and Nick. They are all three very strong designers and have subsequently gone on to very full design careers. Each of these mentors has a number of contestants.  The contestant who wins also has a mentor who wins. Evaluating the mentor is almost as important as evaluating the contestant.  Each week they design at least one garment and send it down the runway. There are judges plus a guest judge every week. The judges in my opinion were the weakest part of this except for some interesting guest judges who were brought on.  There is no judge who is up to par with Isaac M or Michael Kors or Nina Garcia.If you are watching for the creation of the fashion and to see it come down the runway, it happens as much on this show as it does on the others.  You will see a lot of creations.  You will also see the mentors try to find their way as some of them are tempted to all but design the outfit themselves, a big no-no.  Tim Gunn is wonderful as useful.This show needs some work but for its first season was good.  I would be willing to watch season two."
78151,"than the first set I had purchased long long ago,,  maybe they were not lisle, but this compnay has been around a long time,  better than my harbor freight scissor kind"
78152,I can't count the many times my grandson--who just turned three--has watched this video. He watches it over and over.
78153,Major crimes is a sort of follow on series to &#34;Closer&#34;. There is a lot of humor ans psychology in each episode. I enjoy and recommend it.
78154,"I use to use a cloth to clean my strings... this now rests in my guitar tech bag as a very useful tool.Easy to open, clamp on the strings, run it up and down and your strings maintain a clean and clear sound longer! The only thing that I worry about is running the plastic over the frets. I understand that it's only plastic, but I wonder if it will decrease the life of the frets over time...I don't know... if I see an issue, I may update this a year or so down the line.Until then? Excellent solution!"
78155,"Jax is President of SAMCRO and he has made Bobby VP. Opie would have been his obvious choice for VP but he is not active in the gang due to his conflict with Clay.Gemma wakes up with a Hispanic man, Nero, who she slept with and she is so hung over she doesn't even know where she is.  The sheriff is at Opie's house looking for Jax, Tig and Chib who are wanted for the murder of Veronica Pope.  Veronica is the daughter of Damon Pope who is the most feared and powerful drug lord in Oakland.Gemma has taken them to Nero Padilla's escort service headquarters where they are hiding and Jax doesn't trust Nero. They get a call that Tig needs help and Nero gives them the keys to a pickup truck so they can leave and not use their motorcycles. Jax and the guys go to Tig and find all of the bodies. Tig has gotten loose and killed a police officer, a gang member and a cleanup specialist.  They drag the bodies into a covered hole in the ground and pour fuel into the hole and burn the bodies. Meanwhile Tig is holding his dead daughter's (Dawn's) burned body who was killed by Pope in retaliation for Veronica's death.Jax and the gang are back at Nero's offices and they are meeting with their lawyer preparing to turn themselves in to the sheriff.  Jax is discussing legal issues with the lawyer and the existence of the RICO case against SAMCRO and asking her to take care of surrendering to the sheriff.  Jax knows he may be facing a long term jail sentence and he asks Tara to marry him now......Action, action, action! If you didn't think Sons of Anarchy could get more involved and have more exciting action then you were wrong.  This is a great episode and it sets up the major confrontation with Damon Pope and the SAMCRO gang.  There are also several sub plots going on in this episode and it is building the storyline for the season to really kick off.  The Sons of Anarchy is a great series and this episode is critical for you to watch so you understand the confrontations that will soon become a war!  I recommend this episode to you."
78156,"have not in stalled this yet, looks like it will also take care of the issue i had with the light."
78157,"I like this series, lots of twists and turns, reminds me of the series Lost, adding new characters every now and then, I think it has great potential.."
78158,"{4.33 stars}ADORE could have turned out really cheesy, but the very real characters, along with a nice blend of funny and sad moods, fitting soundtrack, and pretty Australian beach scenery keep it from becoming so. Fine performances by all the major players: Though more character and conflict development may seem needed at times, we get to know everyone and everything gradually, and the fact that they are all just fairly ""normal"" (whatever that is) people is pivotal. Not the greatest script, but it's nothing if not realistic.Regarding the plot: The way the quadrangle develops is pretty convincing. Even if what's happening here is nothing illegal, it's obviously weird if not downright perverse. Yet, I was surprised to find myself rooting for both couples as ADORE proceeded, wanting them all to be happy together. The way the two women bear a superficial resemblance to each other, causing us to occasionally forget who's whose mum and who's whose lover, is another interesting effect. Finally, the isolated cove with its stationary sun-raft is a fitting and well-chosen symbol.Though it's obviously not a ""family film"" or one for younger children, there is no gore, serious nudity (just a couple of brief booty-shots of Robin Wright and Xavier Samuel), or other flinchable elements (unless you count the multiple unexplicit sex scenes).ADORE is one of the strongest, most satisfying films to come out in recent years, and I enjoyed it immensely."
78159,"Criminals able to talk about their crimes is not interesting. I enjoy the forensic part of the ID shows, not the emotional story of a criminal."
78160,"I like the characters and the actors who play them. In this hoarked up world, wierdos have become all we get to see on TV. Plain folks are just not entertaining...even Sesame Street characters all have some sort of OCD! This show is full of sympathetic people with &#34;issues&#34;."
78161,"With tailgate thefts on the rise around the country, you really just can't do without this. But you have a factory tailgate lock you say? Guess what? Those can easily be punched out! Do yourself a favor and buy this lock so your tailgate cannot be lifted off easily, and leave your tailgate lock unlocked so they won't be tempted to punch it thinking they will get the gate, only to find out you have this other lock."
78162,"First, you will need to buy the high tone also, or it will sound stupid. It is part #72102. I have put these pair on my last 4 cars. The low tone does have a habit of failing if it gets wet. This has happened twice to me. For some reason, the high tone works fine if it gets wet. Make sure you mount the low tone in a location where it will not get wet.The kit does not include a relay. You may want to install a relay, especially if your car is wired for one horn. The horns draw 4.5A each at 12V. This is usually within factory limits and most fuseboxes will have a 10A or larger relay built in the horn circuit. The kit does include 3 female blade connectors, a mounting bracket and nut, and a jumper wire (needed if your car is wired with one horn lead).And, they are very loud. Packaging declares 130db at 4 inches. I do not have a db meter, but I can assure you the horns will get the job done. The pair has a nice tone, and will rid your car of the little factory &#34;meep meep&#34; horns."
78163,And seem to work. Haven't had any hard rain but I did try them at the car wash and saw they cleared the windshield well. Now we'll see how long they last.

He says he's become the band's manager, even produced and written some songs for them and is simply visiting before he must get on the road again because, ""they are lost without him.""Downtrodden he walks into town to get a drink. There he becomes reacquainted with his longtime nemesis Randy Stevens (Bobby Cannavale) who has inherited his dad's car lot and married the girl, Nikki (Jill Hennessy) who Jimmy uses to pine for. I should say still pines for.The problem is Jimmy never grew up. He still harbours the regrets and frustrations that he's carried with him. The road was the only thing that gave him a feeling of normal ... his only true home. Now he's forced to make a life changing decision - either step up, tell the truth and take on the responsibility of his ailing mother or continue to live a lie.This is a neat little drama filled with great music."
78166,This squirrel guard performs very well. I have 3 and no squirrel has got past. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the screw-on device used to hold it up tends to slip on the smaller poles. This was rectified by use of a small hose clamp below the device.
78167,"I spliced this into the stock porsche wiring on my 987.1 Cayman.  I was even able to get the horns mounted in the right location.These are the exact euro sound I was looking for and they are plenty loud enough on the stock wiring.  If i had more room in the front, I would've used a relay and wired it to the battery."
78168,"I love the antique/cottage look of this hummingbird feeder. It looks nice in a naturalized garden.The main thing is that the hummingbirds seem to like it. I put it out and shortly after my hummingbirds were using it. I havent' had a problem with ants yet, but, an ant guard added to this would be a nice feature.Overall, it works and looks nice in your garden."
78169,"Considering all the violence, anger  and sex involved I, as a 76 year old woman, was so surprised at how quickly I got hooked by this show.  Waiting impatiently for next season to begin.  My children think it is a hoot that I like this show so much."
78170,"Works pretty slick and I like the compact size. I could only give it a 4 star rating because I bought it for my lawn mower and ATV battery. It has 2 separate instructions for whether it is left in the vehicle or the battery is removed. I bought this item to keep a battery topped off that has been removed and taken inside from the freezing temps. If battery is removed it says to add a 24&#34;( I think was the length) lead to the negative terminal. Not sure why this needs to be done. I have never done that with a regular full size charger. You get 2 sets of quick disconnect leads, one with clamps and ones you bolt into you vehicle. I would have settled for one lead with a 24&#34; longer negative lead than the positive."
78171,I will recommend.  keeps your car stuff well organized and uncluttered.  a very good product.  great on its own or to give as a gift item
78172,"It was great A series based on the airline service in the 60's was fantastic.How they got cast and the sets to look like the 60's most of cost A pretty penny,especially for what the women were had to wear.But I think the reason it was cancelled was they put to much questionable stuff in A short time frame."
78173,"I have used and been disappointed by lighter constructed connectors however, these are much more rugged and well constructed to last and not pull apart after many connect/disconnect. Well pleased and highly recommend this product. I purchased these to install in line on my on board battery tenders for my vehicles. I clipped the power wires from charger to battery and soldered these connectors in line with shrink tubing for insulation. This way, when I am not plugged in to household current, I can unplug these slip connectors and break connection between the on board charger and the battery reducing the risk of the charger draining the battery should it malfunction. These connectors do the job nicely."
78174,"I loved this series, unfortunately it's being canceled.  I found the episodes to be very original and well acted with a lot of action.  It's episodes cover the &#34;weird&#34; form the paranormal to the scientific to the extraterrestrial."
78175,"NOT A SIMPLE DIY INSTALLATIONBe prepared to take the collar off your ignition and cut into your ignition wiring.As other reviewers suggested, throw away the directions and go to their website for instructions (although they still aren't very good).Aside from my beef with the installation though, the product works great and gives me the steering controls that I enjoyed with my factory stereo.  It's a shame there's no simpler/cheaper way to go about it.  This product is a necessary evil, but it works."
78176,"This is the #1 mic you should get, recording or live, instruments or voice, it always come through  with a great sound and seems almost indestructible.looking forward to work with it on future projects, can't believe it took me so long to get one of those"
78177,"There are a few things to know about the absorber to get the most out of them.  First, before using, soak in warm water, this makes it more absorbent.  Second, keep it clean.  The wort thing you could do is have a dirty chamois and drag it across your paint, this will introduce maring of your clear coat.  I wash it on gentle cycle with a little distilled vinegar then air dry.  When storing, get it as dry as possible.  Ive had them get moldy in the container from being too damp."
78178,"TYRANT is a new television series that will doubtless polarize the viewers who tune in to see it. It poses many questions - not only about Middle East government but also an East/West attitude split between members of a Middle Eastern family, a hint about same sex relationships in a country where the topic is taboo (watch close the interplay between the son of the `American' family and the son of the security chief), and flashbacks that emphasize the manipulative takeovers of regimes that seem to be in constant flux - depending on which order of Muslims are in power and the rest of the Islamic peoples.The Pasadena, California Al Fayeed family -pediatrician father Barry (Adam Rayner), mother Molly (Jennifer Finnigan), son Sammy (Noah Silver), daughter Emma (Anna Winters) are called back to the unidentified country in the Middle East for a relative's wedding - a demand from Barry's government head father (Raad Rawl) and supported by Barry's evil brother Jamal (Ashraf Barhom). Barry left his country and family at age 16 for reasons of disbelief in his family's conduct and another memory that surfaces. There is fighting, killing, mayhem, sex, nudity, elaborate sets and suspense that keeps the first episode afloat for an opener. Some acting is fine, other barely professional. It will take several more episodes to see how much the show and the audience can tolerate. It seems like an attempt to open windows into the crises in the Middle East, but it leaves the shutters closed for the most part. Keep the subtitles on if you care to identify the names of the characters.... Grady Harp, July 14"
78179,Meguiar's Scratch X 2.0 seems to do the job on little scratches or when you need to get a little paint off.
78180,"With the Winchesters' dad gone, they are truly on their own except for a friend or two.  All they have is each other, though I wish I could count the Impala.Some spoilers may follow.......There is an even darker tone this season, if you can imagine that, with Dean having made a literal deal with the devil to save Sam by going to hell--which he absolutely does not deserve.  There is constantly a sense of time running out, with Lilith doing awful things to our boys and to others, Dean doing some crazy things because he knows what's coming, and Sam looking at him with a blend of pity, fear, and heartbreak over his brother's horrific fate.  I won't soon forget the last few minutes of this season's final episode, and I don't want to reveal them here.Since there is a season four, I can only hope that Sam finds a way to rescue Dean.On a lighter note, the gag reel is very funny, as they always are."
78181,"I bought this to charge the battery on my 99 Lexus GS400.  The battery has gone dead a couple times and I was ready to buy a replacement but thought I would get this and try it.  Its a battery re-born!  Works like new now... this lil baby does a great job of slow charging and also tells you the battery percentage.  Its made well, very compact and is asthetically pleasing to the eye.  I also love that it has storage in the back to put the cables/clips for storage.If you need a battery charger...this is THE one to get!Buy with confidence!"
78182,"I've always liked Timothy Olyphant, and would usually chance watching anything he is in. I'm a war veteran, so I enjoy toughness and shooting in my genre of entertainment. I've come to really appreciate the performances of this splendid cast."
78183,"I started buying these strings for my guitar playing son back in December of 2012 and continue to do so to this very day. He absolutely swears by them. He does go through them fairly quickly being that the humidity here in Hawaii makes them prone to rusting. Other than that, the strings are strong and durable and gives off a nice sound quality. He highly recommends these strings to his fellow guitar players out there."
78184,"I started watching this show on Netflix a while back. About 7 episodes in I loved it. Great show, great season, great ending."
78185,"I love the Griot's Garage carnauba car wax so I was very interested to give their glass sealant a try on my car's windshield.  I have used Rain-X in the past but can't say I was all that impressed.The sealant is applied easily using a dry cloth (I used a microfiber one) after first cleaning the windshield.  Even though I thought I got the windshield very clean, the sealant removed some dirt I missed.  Griot's recommends applying a coat, letting it dry to a haze, and then apply a second coat and let it dry to a haze before polishing it off.  I applied the sealant liberally and still had a lot left after using it on only my windshield.  It dries to a light haze very quickly and polishes to a very clear shine with minimal effort.Rain beads up and runs off the windshield after using the sealant.  It's almost a Star Wars effect to watch the rain beads fly upward off the windshield while driving down the road.  In light rain I don't even have to turn on my windshield wipers.  It remains to be seen how long this effect will last -- my main dissatisfaction with Rain-X is it didn't seem to work for very long -- but so far I really like how this Griot's Garage glass sealant works, and it makes my car's windshield shine as bright as the rest of my car.  My car has expensive water-sensing windshield wipers, and I believe this sealant will help them last longer.  I used it only on my car's windshield, but the product is designed for use on any window including shower stall windows.'Update 5/6/14:  After using the glass sealant a while longer I must say I am disappointed.  It seemed to repel water really well initially, but this effect wore off after just a few rainy days.  It still works a little, but not enough to want to reapply it every week during the rain season.  So what initially seemed to be a great product leaves a lot to be desired in maintenance of its water repellant ability."
78186,A thin story line with many improbably actions but very entertaining just the same.  Someone needs to make &#34;Big Jim&#34; hurt.  And he really is not that big.  Walter White took him out easily.
78187,"I've used mostly peanut butter in mouse traps, with variable success. Sometimes it catches mice, sometimes they'd eat the peanut butter without setting off the trap. No such problem with this stuff- it really sucks the mice in and it's not something they can remove from the trap. I was amazed at how fast it worked. (My cats thought it was worth investigating, too, so don't use it on a snap type trap where cats can reach it!)"
78188,"Father Brown exhibited self-restraint when confronted with ill-mannered or arrogant persons.  His quiet, calm demeanor was pleasant to watch.  Would have enjoyed seeing more of his detective friend."
78189,"The new Harley's have their oil fill and trans fluid fill at odd angles. Its a pretty messy thing to do if you're not careful. The opening for the trans is very small(diameter) and the gear oil gets all over. This pump stops all of that and gives easier access to the trans. It is really the right tool for the job. Great price, quick delivery. I'll have to order some more I think...."
78190,"This is Christopher Gust at his best.  If you're a Christopher Guest fan, you will love this British sitcom.  Guest plays the father of the main character, but as always the humor is in the language and incidents.  My favorite character is the sister with her monkey puppet."
78191,Taking things that are said or taught through the years and putting them to the test and making it fun.  A great show for the whole family.  Great way to get your mind working and maybe inspire you to test something yourself.
78192,I have watched all the seasons of this series and I love the writing as well as the crew. I hope this wasn't the last i will see of them.
78193,This oil arrived and is consistent with the advertising on the webpage. I am very happy with the oil. I will be purchasing my motor oil from Amazon again in the future.
78194,"This isn't the best strap, but it's affordable and pretty good for a beginner's guitar strap. The pick holder on the strap is pretty neat, however I don't find myself using it often. The guitar strap is not very comfortable, but it does the job. Recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar. Don't forget to buy strap locks, you will need it."
78195,"Used this to glue a sandpaper sheet to a terry cloth pad on my buffer so I could use it as a sander.  Bad idea, but the sandpaper held on very good for the orbital sander.  That takes some strength from glue.  A little got on my hand but I washed it off right away.  Was pretty easy to mix and dried in about 4 minutes.  Very good stuff for the price.  I use this over super glue because I think it holds way better."
78196,A good buy.  Does the same job that the Honda OEM part does.
78197,The show has promise and a very good cast. I thought Titus Welliver was the weakest casting choice as I am a fan of the novels but had a difficult time seeing Welliver as Bosch. The pilot had a nice gritty feel to it and deserves a chance to develop into a full series.
78198,"This tuner is amazing, even more so considering the price. It's chromatic, so it will tune anything! I tune electric and acoustic guitars, bass, ukulele and mandolin with it! I've bought three for gifts... It's great.Sooooo, everything I said initially is still true... It's a fantastic little tuner... BUT I've broken two of them. (Where the clip attaches to the tuner - as in a multitude of other reviews...)This tuner *is* amazing... But fragile!"
78199,"'The First 48' offers an interesting view of psychological profiling. The emphasis is not on sensationalism but the efforts to find the offenders. Included are personal aspects of both the victims and perpetrators.  This is the second of the two seasons offered on Amazon Prime. Since this is a TV series, there is repetition (noted in another review) that allows time for commercials. Note that this is an A&E; Network production and is a better quality than other productions in this genre.  Most episodes involve two different criminal investigations and others address a single incident. The episodes take place in different cities and feature homicide detectives from that area. Emotions run the gamut from tragic to humorous. The narrator gives a description and an explanation that is easy to follow. If you like this genre, the portrayal and cases are well presented. The name is derived from that 48 hour window after an investigation begins. Each episode ends with this quote: "". . . presumed innocent until proven guilty."" The 'presumed' means not 'proven' or not 'solved.' There are not always 'complete answers.' If you want 'absolutes,' this series will be disappointing.One might wonder at the seemingly endless availability and types of firearms used. Knives and other means of murder? The choice of weapon offers an interesting insight into human behavior and emotion.Dekalb County, Georgia _ When a twelve year old boy is shot, the detective comments: ""Seems like nowadays things are settled with knives and guns."""
78200,"I'm a user of small grills -- not those great big monstrosities that you use for a backyard barbeque (wish I had one, though!) -- so this size smoker is good for me.  If I did have a much larger grill, I might want more than one of these cause you can't get that many chips in it.  It's a very heavy, sturdy  box, so I anticipate it lasting a long time.  I wet the chips, as one of Tom's tips suggested, and I was happy with the amount of smoke that I got -- nice smoky flavor on my chicken. I'm new to smoking, and just recently got a grill with a top (as opposed to the Hibachi I was using) so I'm anxious to try the smoker again with it using different meats!"
78201,This is one of two squirrel feeders I purchased during the summer. It has worked just as I hoped it would.
78202,"Not good.  From the hood accent females to the blatant political incorrectness (which I wish was funny, but missed the mark) to the odd storyline (mall workers moonlighting as international artifact hunters?) to the contrite villains, this was not good.  Nice try, but try again.  REDLIGHT"
78203,"Raylin Givens, where were you when I needed you?  Raylin has calmed down a lot since the beginning of this series.  Now he only shoots somebody every third show or so.  Walton Coggins still manages to hang onto life, gotta be a bad guy in there somewhere."
78204,haven't used them yet but they are really good  quality and will be good not to get burned when we use our fryer
78205,"Nice snug proper fit that works perfectly, as expected for my motorcycle.  Just in time as my Battery Tender unit's adapter broke.  You'll get a charge out of it."
78206,"Not only the main character but the actor, Gabriel Mann pulls off great one liners and attitude. Now they've added Justin Hartley who is a loved by the ladies in the house no matter what he does. Fantastic series, great acting."
78207,"A couple of days ago I found that a family of racoons moven into my attic so we had to relocate them. I placed this cage with some Oreos insede and in a couple of days I got rid of three the three intruders. The cage worked very well, it is very simple to use. It is big enough fpr opposums, rabbits and racoons. Putting it in the crawl space under the house was a little bit tricky. So when it was time to remove the cage with an animal inside I called the city and the animal control people came and picked up the animal at no charge. They moved it from my cage to theirs and now we are pest free."
78208,"My husband and I absolutely love In Plain Sight! We started watching it on Netflix a while ago and were super disappointed when Netflix didn't add seasons 4 and 5. Luckily, we were able to buy it on Amazon Instant Video and watch it that way! It is a good, clean show about 2 US Marshall's working in the witness protection program. It's action packed, suspenseful, and just enough drama. We have nothing but good things to say about it!"
78209,"This is the best television show I have watched in my life. Before this show, all the seasons, I could not have imagined that a show could be this completely stellar. The writing, the cast, the casting,  the characters, the story(ies), all beyond brilliant."
78210,"Perky-Pet 365 Antique Copper Lantern Feederas the poet e. e. cummings once said:  I would rather learn from one bird how to sing than to teach 10,000 stars how not to dance.Among other things, I'm a nature photographer and avid bird watcher.  Wild birds need clean water, a bit of shelter and food -- it's that simple. :)  I've gone through my share of bird feeders, over the past 11 years -- some good, some bad.  They are not all alike!Perky-Pet 365 Antique Copper Lantern Feeder is impressive, right off the bat!a few things I really like about the Perky-Pet 365 Antique Copper Lantern Feeder, other than it comes in one of my favorite colors -- copper:* good sized feeder, holds up to 5lbs  of seed.  ( hint:  My own observation:  a huge variety of birds seem to love black oil sunflower seeds ).* sturdy metal housing with see through plastic inserts that slide out for easy cleaning and allows one to see if feeder needs refilling.* small holes in bottom of feeder for drainage, in case rain gets into feeder from angle, but the holes are too small for seeds to drop through.  Don't worry, the metal roof overhangs -- the housing -- to keep most rain out, imo.* hold down button on top and finial moves up hanging wire/with loop so lid can be lifted and seed poured in.* good sized, rounded metal stands are just the right size for little song and medium sized birds like Cardinals, Blue Jays and Morning Doves to stand on, while eating.* decorative, as well as functional.  ( may create a bit of ""neighbor-envy"", if ya know what I mean ) :)I find the Perky-Pet 365 Antique Copper Lantern Feeder to be everything I look for, in a feeder -- and the birds flock to it!  *Will upload photos later*Does the Perky-Pet 365 Antique Copper Lantern Feeder sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Would make a Fantastic gift!  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013"
78211,"I loved The Closer because it combined realistic events with good writing and humor. Major Crimes follows that formula pretty well. Most of the same characters are present, but there is a little energy lost without Kyra Sedgwick. However, the story lines are good and the characters retain most of their individuality in this series."
78212,"My older children 6-9 loved this show and compared it to mythbusters for kids, which I believe may be a little unfair to the show because the plot was far more than inventing and that kept the show entertaining. I would say that the character development could be a little richer, but the lessons were clear. Thinking outside the box was the definitive lesson throughout. The kids of the Maker shack are &#34;modern heroes&#34; that solve problems using their inventions and envisioning new uses of other inventions. Would love to see this show be made. Nothing like whats on modern networks, and that is so refreshing."
78213,"In the past, I have owned a few of these new space age contraptions for the age old art of catching mice.  Some have turned out to work pretty well, while others have just been chalked up to being too expensive, ineffective, or just not worth it considering both.  This new Nooski system fits into the last category.  As soon as I got it I set it and used it in my shed out back where there always seems to be a never ending supply of mice.  It worked, but only on the second try of baiting it.  The first night out all it accomplished was providing a free meal.  That was the fault of the 4 step directions that don't make it exactly clear as to just where to put the bait.  Like another reviewer here already stated, the brief diagram/instructions included with the trap doesn't do a very good job of telling one precisely where to load the bait.  It says in a very small illustration to load some peanut butter, cheese, etc on the bait ""tray"", but there is no real tray, just the front of the unit where the mouse enters.  The first night out all that happened was a fortunate mouse went to bed with a full belly since the peanut butter I smeared inside the tube wasn't close enough the ""catch"" that springs the trap.  The second night did in fact catch a mouse after realizing the supposed tray described meant sticking the bait as far inside the tube as possible without tripping the trap.Which brings me to loading the thing.  I didn't have so much trouble wiggling the tight little elastic band over the loader as I did reinstalling it into the tray without setting it off.  I tried it several times and set it off half of that time while just trying to snap it back in place.  It's tricky but I am sure one would get used to it over time.  My problem with it overall is that its just not worth all the trouble, considering there is a really nicely priced and very effective new design on the classic theme of traps that works extremely well, and doesn't require any replacement supplies as this does.  I have included a link to that trap at the end of this review.  I own a couple of them and they work great, and are very easy to set. As for this thing, it's effective and deadly for sure.  But its a pain to load, needs replacement rings that can't be found locally easily, and as others have noted here, doesn't appear to be very well built.  I can imagine it snapping or cracking after a short amount of use as it has with others here considering how rough you have to be at times loading it.  Personally I don't recommend it and advise you to follow the link and gain some real peace of mind over your pesky varmints... : )Snap-E Mouse Trap by Kness"
78214,"I like the product, i like the idea to have something that can hold the picks so they dont get lost, i thought that it could hold a few more picks. I think i putted about 7 picks in it, but hey, it works and i would buy it again.I forgot to say that there is double sided tape on the back if you want to put it on your guitar (thats what i did, it looks good and durable).Also, It's Cheap!!!!!"
78215,This is why I hate filling these things out. I don't really have anything  to say outside of what I already said.
78216,I love this show - period!  Each season they have a new set of unique plots and I really enjoy watching the cons unfold. LOVE  Christian Kane!!!
78217,This set is heavy duty. Be sure to place it in a place that won't get wet or the seed feeder base will fill with water. This set seems bombproof.
78218,"I have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus. I have several bad habits, including a tendency to need to grip the pick too tightly or I drop it at some point. On a bit of a lark I bought a pack of the Clayton BeeHolds (0.5mm,) and really like them. The hexagonal hole really does make them stay in place with much less grip required, and I find the hole to be in a very natural-feeling spot. The pick is fairly long, but I have not had any accuracy problems with them, and so far durability has been good.I still use other picks too, but I really like these and can't imagine not keeping an ample supply on hand."
78219,"There's a reason Law & Order: Special Victims Unit has been around for ten seasons.  If you haven't watched any of the other seasons before starting this one though, I would suggest you go start at the beginning.  Sure you could probably watch a few of these with no problem, but the connection with the characters just wouldn't be there.Law & Order SVU explores the cases that are the hardest to work.  Child abuse, rape, elder abuse and other rough topics require a special sort of detective, which is where the SVU division comes in.  Each of the episodes is a stand alone on its own (there are very few that are continuing story-lines) but the characters have some story arcs that go through the seasons (like Stabler's family life).  The episodes in this season were good, SVU gets better or stays good with age apparently.  There were a few stinkers, and I can't say that I enjoyed the last episode and what happens in it, but largely the episode pool had some interesting stories.  A particularly interesting one would be ""Confession"" in which a teenage boy admits to being a pedophile and that he wants helps.  ""Retro"" deals with untreated AIDS in children and the belief that it is not a disease.  I didn't like the episode ""Stranger"" very much, in which an abducted girl returns to her family and not all is what it seems.  It just didn't play out very realistically.The characters are always well played.  Hargitay as Dt. Benson and Meloni as Det. Stabler have good chemistry on scene.  And Florek, who plays Captain Cragan has always been a favorite of mine.  The other detectives played by Ice-T and Belzer get a little screentime in this season, but they always take a second seat to Hargitay and Meloni.  Most of the other reoccurring cast members appear here too to help the detectives along with their cases.  The bad guys weren't as black and white in this season though, but many shades of grey as the authors attempted to discover something relatable to them to make it harder to want to convict them.  Like in the one episode ""Confession"" you want to help the boy but still be disgusted by his actions.Because of some of the camerawork in this season involving violence, gore, sexualized positions and other such things, this show may not be suitable for all viewers.  If you know you're bothered by things like that you probably shouldn't watch it.  It's not enjoyable to watch otherwise but rather it makes you want to catch the bad guy and see that justice is done.  That's the whole premise of a cop show, to see the bad guys go down.This is one of the better crime shows on television and it has a lot of viewers.  If you've made it to the tenth season you probably already know that though.  And in that case, this season won't disappoint.Review by M. Reynard 2013"
78220,I got these tools to remove the car interior.  It works perfectly and is scratch proof.  The material is excellent. The price is amazing low for its quality. I am glad that I found these tools.
78221,"I purchased this for my son's acoustic guitar.  I was tired of finding it not in its case and lying on the floor, or against his dresser.  Since he got this stand, his guitar has been put away on it every time.  The security strap is a nice feature, to make sure the guitar doesn't get knocked off the stand.  Great value for the money!"
78222,"I'm sorry, but I found this movie to be incredibly boring. Some friends forced me to watch it. Colin Farrell stars as an Irish fisherman named Syracuse who finds a woman named Ondine in his fishing net. He and his daughter, Annie believe she is a mermaid. I wouldn't recommend ONDINE!!!"
78223,"I got hooked on this show last year and did a marathon of all six seasons.  I don't get cable at my house so I was able to watch the first five seasons for free using my Amazon Prime account, but I couldn't wait until the sixth season was free on Prime so I paid for it.  Fantastic storylines, characters and acting."
78224,"These are by far improved over the jacks that came with the trailer, I used the for extra support on the downhill side of where it is setup right now."
78225,"we bought a house that was occupied by grandchildren for about 5 years so the yard was left to go wild. I have been pulling weeds for days and ripping up blackberry bushes (the worst weed and so aggressive, especially in the PacNorWest) and finally I just had to get some help. I sprayed this stuff just about everywhere. Oddly, Morning Glory didn't give a $4*t. Everything I sprayed was either suffering or dead in 24 hours. 28 hours later everything was dead. Everything except for the morning glory. 5 days later the morning glory is doing just fine. I used 3 packets to cover roughly 3,000 sq ft."
78226,"Bebe Neuwirth is a wonderful actress, and I applaud Amazon for snatching her up, but this insipid show is terribly written and awkward to watch, and by God the actors playing the interns are either terrible or being given terrible material.  Hold on to Bebe, but fire this show."
78227,"This is a nice pick, thicker and easy to hold on to.  I like the size (smaller than your regular picks) and the tone it allows me to obtain on my guitar."
78228,"I decided to try this product on the recommendation of a friend who repairs and rebuilds transmissions for a living.  The vehicles I used it in are a 2004 GM 5.3L V8 with 4L60E 4-spd and a 2001 Honda 2.0L I4 AWD auto 4-spd.  The ATF in both vehicles had less than 25k miles on it, so I did not flush the system before using this.  Instead, I drained the pans, added the recommended amount of Lubegard Red ATF Protectant, and then refilled the pan using Valvoline Maxlife ATF in the GM and Honda ATF Z1 in the Honda.The result has been transmissions that shift faster and smoother.  The Honda is also less &#34;jerky&#34; (it has always been pretty sensitive to throttle inputs).  I also noticed the Honda has a more positive torque converter lockup since adding Lubegard.I'm happy with the performance of this product so far and plan on continuing to use it."
78229,"Well, that's overstating it a little, but several people told me I wouldn't like FW strings on my bass. I wanted to try them to get closer to an earlier electric bass sound, smoother and more mellow. I considered RWs to be way too bright on my guitar. So I put these on my 1978 MusicMan Sting-Ray bass. I only have a little Peavey practice amp, which may account for how bright these still sound. But I love them. I have to dial the active EQ treble control all the way down, this is just a bright-sounding bass! But I wanted more of a stand-up doghouse bass sound, like early basses had. I have a low-level Hofner violin bass, also with FWs on it (it shipped with RWs,what were they thinking???), but I loves me my MusicMan. And I love the sound of these strings. Oddly, a smidgen of the wrap extends below the nut, but it doesn't seem to affect the sound. As soon as I get a REAL amp, I expect these to completely satisfy. And they WILL pop, but then again, this is an awesome bass, made during Leo's time with MM. But if you want that real ""vintage"" sound, these are pretty damn good. Lack of a good amp, and not knowing how long they'll last is why I gave them 4 stars. Otherwise, 5 star all the way."
78230,"These guys show a whole new side to negotiation and buying neat stuff.  My favorite &#34;reality&#34; show.You can learn some worthwhile negotiating tricks from Rick and the Old Man.Interesting and likeable characters and much better than Antiques Roadshow, which is very much parallels."
78231,"Note: Amazon first made Series 3&4 available via streaming (free for Prime members) several months ago, and another fan of the series made it known to me that Series One and Two are now available via streaming (free for Prime members).Kevin Whately, the consummate actor who portrayed Chief Inspector Morse's (John Thaw) long-suffering Detective Sergeant Lewis on ""Inspector Morse"", is now Detective Inspector Lewis in ""Inspector Lewis"", a high quality investigative drama set in the academic town of Oxford, England.Having watched all of the Inspector Morse episodes, I can see the evolution of Lewis' character (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Whately) from a diligent albeit lowly sergeant under the guidance of the amazing Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) to a confident, outspoken, yet still down to earth DI who now has his own underling in the form of the intellectual, gifted DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).Season 2 of Inspector Lewis is quite an engaging series, containing many interesting episodes featuring DI Lewis (Kevin Whately) and DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox). Part of what makes Insp. Lewis a charming series for me is the banter between Lewis and the more cerebral, Cambridge-educated (in theology), Hathaway. There's lots to satisfy the discerning viewer in Season 2 - picturesque Oxford, literary references, and riveting plots, not to mention the excellent ensemble cast.Season 2 contains the following episodes:And The Moonbeams Kiss the Sea - One of my favorites of all the Lewis episodes. This is not only well-written, but is also atmospheric. Lewis and Hathaway try to discover the link between two murders. One is of a maintenance worker at Oxford's Bodleain Library, and the other is of a popular art student. As they dig deeper, they find out that the two deaths are related to some high level forgery involving works of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Oxford dons addicted to gambling.Music to Die For - Whilst investigating the murder of an elderly gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse. Poor Lewis gets sort of entangled with a beautiful German, but are her motives purely romantic?Life Born of Fire - The death of a gay student, gay bashing, and college politics get to Hathaway since the dead student also happened to be Hathaway's friend and former classmate. There are some truly strange twists in this one.The Great and the Good - An intriguing episode. A young girl Beatrice is found drugged and a victim of rape, and evidence points to a certain Oswald Cooper, who himself ends up garrotted and castrated. The question is: who is the killer and what is the motive?Allegory of Love - A mysterious young woman is found killed, the weapon being an antique Persian mirror. This resembles a scene found in a historical novel written by up and coming Oxford author, Dorian Crane. Then another young woman is threatened, leading Lewis and Hathaway on a desperate search for the truth.The Quality of Mercy - death and Shakespeare meet when the actor playing the role of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice is found murdered. When another murder occurs, Lewis and Hathaway find their hands full as the list of suspects gets longer.The Point of Vanishing - Curious case of a man killed in his own bathtub.I'd recommend the Inspector Lewis series to any fan of quality British crime procedurals."
78232,I order these parts because I wanted to break up the solid color of the front end.  These make a great addtion to the front and installation was very easy.  The fit is very good and they stay in place.  I like the new look with them in place.
78233,Lost track of the show.  What small amount of the show I watched was pretty good.I need to look at this on Netflix for free.
78234,"I usually love Amy S's raw, pushing the envelope, but this just wasn't so funny. I had hoped for more stand up bits and less pseudo sitcom vignettes. Darn....hoped for more"
78235,Can't say that this series is not interesting. Keeps you guessing as to who really are the good guys and bad guys.
78236,"Gary Trudeau has done it again.  Only in film and not just political cartoons.  But in actuality this show is his cartoon characters come to life in the form of politicians that are so much like clowns, and impostors that it is easy to laugh at them.  The stories while outrageous are entertaining, humorous and true to life.  It is truly a sad state of affairs that we have such a dearth of unqualified candidates running in our elections.  Oh my...makes me want to think more clearly about finding out the background of every candidate thoroughly before voting."
78237,"mj is an oversaturated bag of hatred and meanness. the physics of her situation do not end well. i like the show, especially the lunatic golenessa (GG), but mj is a hot mess and not in a good way. more later because amazon only lets us do one review per season..."
78238,"Than watching things being made at a HUGE level. The unknown of what may be inside of the factories blasting out hundreds of thousands of everyones favorite treats! Thanks Food Network, and Mark...good stuff, how about more seasons?"
78239,I simply cannot say enough good things about this program.  Exciting.  Riveting.  Great characters and an interesting plot with each episode.  One of my all time favorites.
78240,"I found I got caught up in it, while I don't like some of the characters finding out what is in the storage units is fun. I like the part after the bidding when they open the units.  I have learned about some of the items and had no idea.  I know people who lost storage units and I think of them each time I watch wondering if I am going to see their stuff.  I tried the Texas version and them I could not get into at all."
78241,"Season two is great. I hate the opening credits, seems kind of cheesy to me. The shows are great though and the mysteries they are trying to solve are always exciting."
78242,Good price fast delivery.  Have been using rain X for both my cars for several years.  Very good product.
78243,"Serving up drag realness, hunty! Loving every minute of the show. I hope it continues. Lots of laughs. Great cast. RuPaul is witty and wonderful. Love Santino and Michelle Visage. Lots of celeb judges."
78244,So these are heavy strings that work well. I did have an issue with the strings messing with my bridge on my guitar but with some more springs it worked well enough.
78245,"I love this, now I don't have to find my pick.I bought one and this is my second one for my another guitar.I also purchased an extra one as a gift for my friend."
78246,As good as advertized.Rugged and sturdy.Live up to expectations and is comfortable.I would definitely buy a few more of these.
78247,This is a great product for the money. Works as described and easy to use. Highly recommend this to anyone does their own brake jobs.
78248,Works great for cleaning my wheels.  It is the right shape to fit between the spokes and the soft sheep skin doesn't harm the finish.
78249,"It is an interesting take on why people should not visit Portland OR. According to the weekly series: there's a monster around every tree! Overall I like the show, but would hope season #3 would be the last as we all need closure in this."
78250,"Another quality product from Mothers. I am not sure that you necessary need a brush dedicated to wheels, but considering how dirty they get, it's probably a good idea."
78251,Some character development but not enough to make it a 5 star.  The tension between Mom and Pop is interesting and I wonder how often this dynamic carries through to the real world.
78252,"Though the switch between doctors made me a little mad and a little sad, David Tennant grew on me and I forgave the show for the betrayal at the turn of the season. I highly recommend this show to any who like science-fiction, specifically time-travel romance material."
78253,I WAX THE CAR/MOTORCYCLES ALL THE TIME AND I RATE THIS LIQUID WAX HIGHER THAN MEGUIAR'S THAT I HAVE USED FOR YEARS.  YOU WILL LIKE HOW IT GOES ON AND BUFFS/SHINES UP SO EASILY.  GREAT FRAGRANCE TOO.
78254,"Does a super job on brass, copper, silver, aluminum, bronze and stainless steel. Polishes most metals to a mirror-like finish. Very similar to Flitz polishing cream."
78255,"I got this to use when I do my annual siding and driveway power washing because it says it cleans vinyl/aluminum siding, gutters, roofs, stucco, and brick and also contains Sporex to clean off mold and mildew. I have green mildew on some of my vinyl siding and was excited to give this a try to hopefully avoid using a scrubbing brush and make it easier to clean. I used this exactly as directed and while I did like the low odor factor, it did nothing else that plain water and my power washer couldn't do alone.I used this on the mildew and it didn't even come off, even after letting it sit for a few minutes, so I had to use the scrub brush anyway. I also used this on my concrete driveway and sidewalks to try to get rid of some rust colored stains and it didn't make any difference, plus I still had to use a scrub brush to get stains off. Bottom line, save the $11.99 and just use plain water because the results will be the same!"
78256,"Don't know how I missed the first season, but I am glad Amazon had it available on Prime.  Got all caught up just in time for the new season.  Sex, politics, espionage...what could be better!  I look forward each week to the newest episode!  Anyone who likes Tom Clancy novels should appreciate this show.  It's fast paced, well acted,  and never predictable.  I recommend it!"
78257,The only regret that i could possibly have is that i ran out of episodes to watch. Dr.Who is great fun.
78258,"Purchased this to secure my tow hitch ball mount in the receiver. Felt a little more at ease that I had a lock on this, but the lock is cheap and looks like it can easily be broken into. The key has to be inserted and turned all the way multiple times to unlock it so its best if you don't have a bunch of crap on your keychain.Still have it on my tow hitch so that the ball mount does not get stolen."
78259,Fit my VW CC 2.0TSI perfectly and was much cheaper than the OEM filter. I believe Mann is the manfacturer of VW/Audi filters anyway but not 100% sure of that.
78260,"This unit has a wider handle than most of the inexpensive string winders.  I've restrung a dozen guitars in the past week, including two 12-strings, and it is holding up well."
78261,"There is nothing terribly unusual about Grabbers as B movies go; Love interest, monsters, clever attempts to destroy them. The idea that alcohol keeps them away was novel and there were a few funny scenes. This is not a gore fest which I especially liked about it. Don't expect huge laughs but its still an enjoyable little flick worth your rental dollar."
78262,The acting the writing the concept.....it has great replayability as well for viewing a second time. It's like silance of the lambs/six feet under/CSI all rolled into one quality show.
78263,"I like this series. It's interesting, informative and fun to see what goes into the production of items we use every day."
78264,"I got 5 of these, they are absolutely the best, no more boards, no more snapping cumbersome orange squares.Go for it , the best.Mo"
78265,"As a fan of The Onion I had high hopes for this but it let me down big time.  The best part of the whole things was the girl reading the news over the closing credits.  Other than that it just seemed like a bunch of scenes spliced together from other ""zany"" comedies.Besides, isn't a spoof of television news completely redundant given that Fox News is already on the air."
78266,"I'm a beginning player so I'm trying to make things as simple as possible starting out.  I was looking for an easy way to get my strap on and off my acoustic, and really didn't want to mess around with changing out the hardware to mount straplocks.  This strap performs exactly the same function without having to do anything additional to my guitar.  The ratcheting heads are kind of wide and my top button is fairly close to the neck so at first it was a really tight squeeze, but a little customization of the strap head with a file and some sandpaper solved that issue.The locking mechanism works by way of a keyhole that rotates closed with a ratchet gear to lock the strap head to the button. To attach, put the keyhole over the button and rotate it closed.  Your strap is now locked in place. To remove it, hold the release lever and rotate the keyhole back to its fully opened position.  That's it.  Really, it's that simple.I'm a taller guy (6'3&#34;) and after adjustment there is plenty of strap to spare should I need it longer at some point. The leather feels robust, and it was pretty soft and comfortable right out of the box.  Can't wait to see how it does after it breaks in. This was a great choice and I couldn't be happier."
78267,"Just got this stand today.First impressions are always important, and this stand gave me a good impression.It seems to be made solid enough, not like some cheap off brand crap.The base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over.The telescope mechanism is quite well made.Comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters.I got mine set up to extend up to 3ft tall. It's quite the perfect height for when I'm seated on my stool.One thing I did not quite like about the construction is the crew on rod to the base place. It unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved. Maybe adding something to keep it screwed in?Would recommend to others.Probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs."
78268,I was super excited to give this a try.  The humming bird fight over the nectar in the feeder that we have so I wanted to add another one to our porch.  This feeder is BEAUTIFUL!  Much nicer than the red plastic one that I have now.  The only problem is that the hummers will not feed from it.  I am not sure why that is.  I had such high hopes for this product but I guess the birds just don't like it.  It's so easy to clean and I had high hopes of phasing out my old one and getting more like this one.  If it doesn't attract the birds there in no point in getting another one.
78269,"Not sure what is setting off their alarms, so let me say... in the first 5 minutes of this movie,  if you can't tell what the director implies where the EVIL comes from...then look really really hard at the cave entrance and figure out what it reminds you of.This movie will hold your attention but its not a horror movie.  It can be suspensful in scenes but it's more just a odd creepy movie."
78270,"Hell on Wheels season 1 is raw and fast moving.  A diverse set of characters who show the mix of cultures, including prejudices, that inhabited the Union Pacific's construction camp.  Always absorbing."
78271,"I think that this was the my least favorite of the pilots, I like the actor from Paranormal Activity 3, but other than that nothing seem to mesh on this show."
78272,"Well I sort of like the way the show plays out from episode to episode......so far that is until I read the info for the shows that are still being downloaded......In episode number 9 ZUMA CAYNON Det Winters is fatally shot by a Mexican Drug Lord.......then well HOLD the PRESSES in the episodes that are still waiting to be viewed Det Winters is again living.  He is noted to be in episodes 18, 20, 21, and 22.  Oh and in episode 22 he is fatally wounded again.  Episode 22 is titled WESTWOOD.  Now then Morales also has two episodes where he is noted as returning to the police department and involved in the same action.  The first is episode 9 which is titled SILVER LAKE and the next is episode (number 19) is titled CARTHAY CIRCLE.  I am not sure if this is what will be happening as I am still waiting for the episodes to download to my system; but one of two things is a bugger in this matter.  The first being that whom ever wrote the info for these episodes made a big ERROR, in which case AMAZON needs to fix this quickly or the studio was looking for a way to slide a curve ball to the viewers and while at it making a few bucks for the same episode just by renaming them.Well I still say I like how the episodes I have seen so far have been produced and will press for either a correction of the information for the episodes that have been noted above or press for a refund for the repeat episodes that were just renamed......."
78273,"I've been carrying the same black leather Stone Mountain bag every winter since 2008. It had become dull, so I decided to try this leather conditioner. I cleaned my bag with mild soap & water, let it dry, then applied a dime-sized blob of this (clear) conditioner. That's all it took for the entire bag that measures about 9 x 12 plus the shoulder strap. My bag looks new and has the leather smell it lost a long time ago. I also used this on the vinyl dashboard of my car with equally good results. As so little is used, this bottle should last quite a while. I also like that it's made in the USA.~~~~Sample provided for review~~~~"
78274,I love the Motomco Tomcat stations. The rat station is perfect for use in my barn. It is sturdy even though it is supposed to be disposable. It stays where I put it. It doesn't seem to be disturbed by other critters.The poison works fast and well. This is a great solution for a yucky problem.
78275,Since they were named &#34;Gator Grip&#34; I expected them to have a good gripping surface.  That was not the case.  The entire material and holding surface is the same material.  Also they weren't as large as I expected.  They are still usable as decent picks.
78276,"You can use this oil in for the engine oil, primary, and transmission in Harley's.  My Streetglide seems to run cooler using this full synthetic compared to the dyno oils.  With Mobil 1 you cant go wrong.  It is a high quality oil and a good price.  A lot cheaper than royal purple."
78277,"The capo looks nice and works without any problem.  You can tell it is a cheaper model because the action is stiff.  But the build is solid, and it looks like it will last for a long time."
78278,"Man this is perfect! Some people says that the cs3 is noisy but I thinks that depends on what type of electric conections you got at home or place you play, if you don't have a independent circuit for your pedalboard there's gonna be a lot of noise, most of all bcuz of the compression (obviously)... For me this is PERFECT, doesn't make any noise with my conections... Tottally recommend this!"
78279,"I have been using this bait for years.  I purchase big containers from a pest control company and use either small bait traps that were purchased on-line or bigger traps that are on a concrete block and purchased from the local branch of a national pest control company.  Mice don't bother with the bait much during the summer, but like it in the other seasons.  It has worked well for me in my country home.  I have never had any problem with decaying mouse odors.  I also use traps (I likeJT Eaton 409BULK Jawz Plastic Mouse Trap, For Solid or Liquid Bait (Pack of 24)).  The combination works well for me.  I never have had my dogs or any neighbor dogs show any interest in the bait, but something strong at night (raccoons?) have messed with them a few times.The only difference in this product, the Tomcat Mouse Killer II, and the Tomcat Mouse Killer I is that the top of these containers are cloudy and the I's tops are clear.  It is easier to see how much bait is left with the Is, but I slightly prefer the II's as I don't really want to see any more than I have to."
78280,"It was rough enough for the fans of NCIS to lose Kate Todd by having Ari Haswari snipe her at the end of Season 2.  So, starting Season 3 off by showing Kate's murder from Ari's POV is a little rougher.  But the two episodes that start off Season 3 of NCIS--the two part ""Kill Ari"" episodes--really bring up a subject in this series that hadn't been fully fleshed out.  Obviously, these two episodes allow the regular characters to come to grips with the loss of Kate--the irony of Kate's ghost talking to Ducky and Ducky not talking back to the ghost, the overall story of how the survivors all see Kate.  McGee seeing a superwoman, Abby seeing Elvira, Tony being Tony in seeing Kate (That schoolgirl outfit), and Gibbs seeing Kate as he last saw her--with a hole between her eyes.  Just as obviously, ""Kill Ari"" allows for the introduction of Cote De Pablo's Ziva David, the Mossad/Masada agent liased to NCIS in the wake of Kate's death and Lauren Holly's Jenny Sheppard--Gibbs' former partner/lover who rose beyond working the field to the NCIS director's job.But my observation after a couple of viewings of this box set is that the underlying story of the season is the revelations about the history of Leroy Jethro Gibbs.  For much of the first two seasons, Mark Harmon's ""tough, no-nonsense investigator"" (To quote the liner notes on the set) has always had an understated sense of humor that has allowed him to smile quitely at the office interaction between the members of the team while presenting his harder face.  But that exterior begins to crack in the ""Kill Ari"" episodes; the mystery surrounding Jethro's background begins to unfold as Ari murders Kate, then takes his shot at Abby and captures Dr. Mallard.  This is what starts leading Jethro to being close to Ziva--maybe no one notices, but because of the information that she uncovered about Jethro and fed to her half-brother Ari, Officer David feels partially responsible for Kate's murder.Through Season 3, we start getting clues to who Jethro is and what he keeps from everyone--the flask that we see at the end of ""Under Covers"", his continued attraction towards redheads (It certainly is no coincidence that Holly/Sheppard is a redhead), and the subtleties of his relationship with Ziva--forged in an oddly shared tragedy.  Of course, much of all that goes on in the season comes to a head in the ""Hiatus"" two-parter at the end of the season.  We find out why Gibbs is what he is, how many of his actions have prepared DiNozzo for running the team and prepped Tim for being an agent; and how the discoveries affect his relationship with Dr. Mallard and Director Sheppard.As always since this series started, the performances are stunning.  Mark Harmon continues to embody the toughness and instincts of Jethro, but also had to be very nuanced as Gibbs' painful history comes out.Michael Weatherly's Tony DiNozzo continued being the second coming of David Addison (my usual Moonlighting aside), but Tony had to face growing up and being a decision-maker/leader (""Bait""), and had a difficulty through this season that he hadn't had in the previous two--ZIVA.Cote De Pablo flipped the dynamic of the team.  As Ziva, Cote brought a much more formidable presence to the squad.  In the first two seasons, Tony could get Kate off-balance with his remarks and his stunts, offending her Catholic schoolgirl sensibilities.  In the third season, Ziva--partially because of her background, partially because it was just HER--was able to get Tony off his feed more than he thought possible.  An example of this--aside from her driving, or her mangling of slang--came up in ""Probie"", when she was able to get Tony to reveal why he was receiving calls from a sperm bank.  De Pablo was able to affect a very cool and very canny customer in Ziva.  Many viewers are always going to miss Sasha Alexander, but Cote is a wonderful fit.Sean Murray's Tim McGee is still a wonderful work in progress; the nerd-boy field agent who continues to get tortured by DiNozzo in a big-brother/little-brother fashion.  He still seems over his head at times, eager to please Gibbs (Or at least keep Jethro from popping him one in the back of the head--isn't it funny how The Head Slap has become one of the show's many trademarks?).  Plus, there's whatever seems to be going on in his private life, whether or not it's with Abby.Of course, what can be said about Pauley?  Perrette is a scene-stealing wonder on screen, especially in Abby's lab when she's mainlining the ""Kaff-Pow"" or getting Bert to do what he does (Her stuffed hippo--YEAH, THAT ONE).  Plus, we get surprised by Abby's ability with duct tape (""Frame Up"") and her temper in general (""Bloodbath"").David McCallum's Dr. Mallard continues to be the second coming of Jonathan Quayle Higgins, though not as prissy as Robin Masters' major domo.  Ducky continues to tell his stories while working his was through the cadavers.  Plus, we get another visit from Nina Foch as Ducky's mom late in the season, getting a surreal moment when she's visiting the NCIS HQ.Many people thought the introduction of Jenny Sheppard as fluff.  Given the underlying story of the season, Lauren Holly's character was actually needed.  Jenny became an insight to Gibbs' relationship issues and why he stays operating as an investigator--basically, she knows certain things about Jethro that his squad aren't privvy to--though as it turns out, she doesn't know the whole story (Until ""Hiatus"").The good guest shots in this set have to start with Sasha Alexander, and her completion of the Catlin Todd storyline.  Her ghost appearing in various forms to the team members was striking (Of course, her schoolgirl outfit in Tony's vision was typical Tony).  Rudolf Martin's Ari Haswari was brilliant--slick, dangerous, deceptive and unstable.  I found myself regretting Ari's storyline being completed--he could have been Wo Fat to Gibbs' McGarrett (Hawaii Five-O reference).  It's always fun when Jessica Steen drops in to trade remarks with Weatherly as Paula Cassidy.  Michael Bellisario's turn as Abby's lab assistant is a comical and dangerous turn.  Finally, we can't forget Muse Watson's introduction in the ""Hiatus"" episodes as Gibbs' mentor when he joined NIS, Mike Franks.  Franks' amusement at the changes--the female director in particular--are tempered by his having to fill in many of the blanks for Gibbs when Jethro is recovering from amnesia.Ultimately, the season of change that is NCIS Season 3 is a storytelling wonder--full of the humor and action that has been the staple of the series since it's beginning, but also the undercurrent of melancholy that permeates this season.  The loss of Kate really becomes the latest in a series of painful losses for Gibbs--but we never realize it until the end of the season."
78281,Loved Betas.Interesting twists and turns.Keeps you wanting more.Would highly recommend........Would like to see the showing increased to Saturday as well.Lets have a Beta Party.
78282,"The 10th anniversary season ofProject Runway: The Complete Eighth Seasonopens in Times Square with Heidi Klum, Tim Gunn, Nina Garcia, and Michael Kors. The competing designers bring their own outfits, and they are tasked with making another design for the Tomes Square catwalk. It's a creative concept and it works. It's a relief to see Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn back after their absence in Project Runway All-Stars. It was great to see Mondo Guerra's win in Project Runway All-Stars... but the absence of Heidi&Tim;, there was a void. Luckily, Heidi&Tim; are back for the new flock of contestants.

78286,"Despite the superb acting this movie just did not cut it.Here are some of my random thoughts after watching it.Is it just me or is that the most miserable and unhappy town in America?Midway through the movie I was ready to stick my head into one of those toxic drums.The fact that a warehouse full of deadly toxic waste was being guarded by a couple of beer drinking Mexicans in lawn chairs was laughable.The scene where Auntie was suddenly overjoyed to move out of the only house she ever lived in was a mystery in itself.The weirdest part of the movie though, was when the toxic waste boss suddenly realizes that toxic waste is.......toxic.At the end when the guy announces he was quitting, Auntie is overjoyed to be moving out and everyone is in love, I was expecting a giant Wizard of Oz rainbow to be there when she opened the door and announced ""What a beautiful day!"""
78287,"No such thing as a bad episode of The Mentalist! Patrick Jane and Det Lisbon are always fresh, entertaining and on their toes. Excellent season of a fabulous series!"
78288,"An interesting mix of historical facts and hypothetical possibilities about the Celts throughout Europe and Britain. A bit repetitive from episode to episode, but it seems each episode can stand alone."
78289,"My studio has powered monitors which require balanced inputs.  I purchased several of these cables at varying lengths and found them quite acceptable for this application.  I'm not sure I'd put them in my remote recording kit--they're not really heavy duty.  But for speakers or other static applications, they're just fine."
78290,"I spend about 10 solid weeks a year during the summer on the road with our family of 6 people. For years I have bought one of these before each season. We get an entire summer out  of one of these and I have never been let down by bad tasting water. Why spend a lot when this filter does what you need.I have used these filters for about 12 years and they are the best for the money. They really last a few months of constant use.I mounted this water filter in line inside trailer where I was able to cut main line in and added hose fittings to accomadate the filter ( most water lines in are a hose material untill they tie into pex tubing so this was easy to do with basic hose fittings ((if its easy to get to as mine is)).Doing it this way I dont need to mess with the filter everytime I setup and breakdown anymore outside trailer.I also add a 2nd one on the cold water side of the main kitchen sink. Pex tubing is what the trailer has as water piping as do most RV these days. I added filter to the pex piping using pex hose fitting as well to accomadate the filter. They sell the filters in 2 packs for about 24.00 so for me its way less exspensive installing these 2 great filters and not worrying about clean water all summer. End of season I simply unscrew the old filter and put in new ones in 5 min. We used to do the type facuet filters along with this filter outside trailer, but that gets old after awhile turning it on and off.Happy Rv Trails"
78291,"The novelty and tension of the earlier seasons are wearing off, but Continuum isn't resorting to extreme tactics to keep itselffeeling fresh.  Those that like it will like it.  Sure there's suspense, and new things to learn, and a sense of building to something,but the makers have wisely chosen to let it be what it is, a series extending for the long haul.  I especially like the increased focuson the future eras, though that does seem to be drawing the action ever which way a bit rather than keeping it focused."
78292,"The first season of this show was fantastic, though parts of it were a tad rough around the edges. Season Two nails it, and this locomotive is clearly running on all cylinders.The person in charge of casting for this show is a genius, for every actor is perfect for the role in question, rounding out a wonderfully colorful collection of characters that bring the period to life. Bohannon steals the show in almost every episode (by virtue of his incredible charisma and unique dilemmas), but he is surrounded by interesting, multi-faceted men and women who help make the world feel full and brimming with personality. And in a gesture of true grit, the writers of this show are never afraid to have serious, lasting consequences inflicted upon their major characters. This is much appreciated, for it makes the show feel ""real"", and it also keeps you truly engaged and on the edge of your seat - because nobody is safe.As for the plot itself, the construction of Mr. Durant's railroad to the west continues to be a fascinating epic filled with intrigue, violence, love, and the occasional moment of unfettered triumph and jubilation. Hell on Wheels is, quite simply, one of the best shows I've ever seen."
78293,"Caillou is about a four-year-old boy (with the same name) who interacts with family, friends, and classmates as he goes on different adventures. Caillou has a sister named Rosie and two of the most patient parents around. It's a classic American family model: a married couple with 2.5 children. The show's family values are straightforward.My two-year-old daughter loves this baldheaded fella. The show has plenty of bright colors, fast-moving scenes, and synergy between the other characters. My daughter stays glued to the tube while this show is on (in fact, it's on as I write this review).On the other hand, I HATE the show because Caillou has a fresh mouth and talks back in a disrespectful way to his parents (I'm too old school, I guess). Sometimes the rugrat throws tantrums to which his patient parents resolve the issue (in one episode, the dad reaches a boiling point and finally ""puts"" Caillou in his place).The show has some good aspects--including a catchy intro--yet it also reinforces behaviors that often leave me vexed.  Watch it at your discretion."
78294,Nice reverb. Can get all of the reverb sounds you want. Got to play with it but I got dialed in easy
78295,Hm. I received this. I opened this. I've used it. I also use it. This product seems to be a pretty good product.
78296,This is an absolutely wonderful series.  I love the information that is shared to show the reality behind the show.  As a healthcare professional it was so interesting to see the portrayal of changes in medicine over the years.  Very well written and played.
78297,"Excellent Spanish gothic film by first time director Juan Antonia Bayona that feels like and Edgar Allan Poe poem. Along the lines of ""The Devil's Backbone (Special Edition), andThe Others (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)this Spanish film proves to be a great haunting movie. Creepy in all the right places. Suspense builds throughout the movie at a perfect pace; this is basically the perfect formula film. First off, the acting is phenomenal. Every single actor, especially Bel&eacute;n Rueda, delivers an exquisite performance that comes off naturally.The film itself is the perfect formula for a horror movie. But herein lays one of the few flaws of this film: it is too formulaic. If you have seen as many horror/suspense movies as I have, you will be able to predict what happens in this film to a T. A bit predicable to the horror fan, the movie still manages to deliver great suspenseful scenes that made pause and become absorbed in the film. There were some scenes that should have been edited out, but the film had a great pacing, building the suspense on each and every scene. The movie had great pacing and great horror moments that left you wanting to see more. The cinematography and direction are the best aspects of this movie and what gives it that great feeling of suspense throughout. The storyline itself was pretty good, but left many things unexplained. I think that many aspects were inconclusive and unfinished. Still, the film is really good and it is one to watch."
78298,"It really pains me to give anything but a 5-star review to a BOSS product, since I'm such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall.  Those compliments apply equally to the CS-3 Compression Sustainer.  And it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less-reliable brand in my signal chain.However, there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know.  The two most common complaints that I see are that it adds ""noise"" to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit.  The former complaint is probably true, though if you're enough of a hobbyist to use a Compression Sustainer, you're probably already contemplated using a noise gate/suppressor, such as the BOSS NS-2.  Problem solved.As for the latter complaint (changes tone), that's also true, but it's not necessarily a bad thing if you LIKE the tone that results.  The whole point of the CS-3 is that it's supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it.  This can result in a muddy, ""neutered"" tone, though you can play with the TONE and other settings to help it.  I also find that with the settings all at 12 O'Clock, the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings.Really, while BOSS pedals are considered to be ""expensive"" compared to many of the other effects out there, the CS-3 should really be viewed as a ""budget"" or ""entry level"" compressor, when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a Keeley Compressor costing north of $200.  The best thing you can say about the BOSS (even compared to the similarly-priced MXR options) is that the CS-3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price.  The biggest negative of the pedal, in my opinion, is that the resulting sound might seem a little too...compressed.But there are a lot of things you could do with a CS-3, and it works best paired with other pedals (chorus, delay, some distortions) that you're trying to smooth out.  Ultimately, it's a pedal that could have been better, though there aren't too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of $100 anyway."
78299,Blue bloods is a great show. It is a show that has amazing family values despite the families issues in defending New York city from danger. A great police show but more importantly an amazing family story. The writers of this show have totally outdone themselves. I think every member of the cast in this program has made their best performance ever. I hope the writers don't ever run out of material because its a great program.
78300,"Blue's Clues is both educational and entertaining. Kids enjoy it,  it doesn't get annoying, and it's not crude humor."
78301,I like it.  Ian Bohen plays Peter was awesome at the end when he said I always have been alpha.  Was cool when he said that.
78302,I have owned them for approximately 2 years and they still look new even thought they have been in the weather the entire time.  Many other tools of lesser quality have already met their demise because of rust or by simply falling apart.  This is one instance where paying a little more for quality was well worth it.
78303,i use this as a replacement on my suzuki c50 motorcycle. the stock bulb looks like a d cell flashlight at best. this bulb really lights us the road. my last bulb went 4 years before needing a replacement.
78304,I have to admit this is a lot of work but the results are totally worth it.  Make sure you wear gloves.... make REALLY sure you wear gloves... but once you get done with this system you'll be thrilled with the way your car looks.
78305,Very efficient handy tool for manual R.V. scissor jacks.Fits in any 3/8&#34; drill motor chuck. The socket is an exact fit for the leveling bolt and works fast for quick set up and take down. It beats the old hand crank bars just remember to have a fully charged battery for your drill.
78306,It's nice to have this gadget nearby you when you play. A lot of songs say capo preferred. It helps you have a bar of strings down all the time in a row to keep your finger free and easy to grab some chords like b major and so on. I recommend this product.
78307,"This tool, combined with a cordless drill, beats the heck out of the crank that came with the stabilizer jacks."
78308,"These filters are of a better quality than stock, cost about the same or less than stock and are mudh easier to remove.  Even the feel between stock and these K & N's is noticable.  They use better quality cases, filter media and gaskets.  Highly recommend."
78309,"I've used a larger Havahart trap for years and had great luck with it, catching, everything from squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, opossums to our family cat.  This one was a bit more tempermental to set than the larger one, but once set, I was able to catch a small squirrel, and easily release him."
78310,5 stars on this one my personal favorite is tornados super amazing to see mother nature destoy all then volcanoes i just dont feel bad for people who live by one and there house is burned up what did you expect but very good scenes of all of natures fury highly recommend
78311,Needed to replace the handle clips for my Silverado tailgate. The OEM parts were too expensive for this small part. There worked GREAT and the price was right!!
78312,These are Not much different than OEM lights.  I was not overly impressed by much if any difference if any.
78313,Looks better than the expansive one my Grandson has.  He keeps using MINE!!!  Arrived early and is of great quality.  Fits my VERY old acoustic just right!
78314,I like that I can disconnect my strap quickly and easily. Makes playing more comfortable and if you have more than one guitar you can use the same favorite strap quickly. I buy one of these for each guitar. But I only use my favorite strap.
78315,"Loved this series.  Interesting, different, wonderful performances and very well directed.  Couldn't ask for more.  Look forward very much to season 2!"
78316,"I have very mixed emotions over this latest entry into the long-running and much-beloved Stargate franchise. I fondly remember seeing the original movie at the theater and was immediately impressed by its imagination. As it evolved into a weekly series I watched as my sons grew and became enthralled in the story line with me. And yes, we even liked ""Atlantis"".The Syfy channel promoted this show as an ""edgier"" Stargate. I found that this did not work for me. The very elements that made the original movie and following 15 seasons so enjoyable was now totally lost in this self-inflicted reinvention. Stories that were once fun, adventurous, full of camaraderie & humor were now jettisoned in favor of a grittier, darker, gloomier, smuttier and meandering approach.Some shows can evolve successfully. What we had here was the results of a very bad miss-calculation by MGM Television in canceling ""Atlantis"". And then upon realizing their mistake the panic-ridden response to rectify this error by delivering back unto us a forced-format that was now supposed to be better because now it was ""edgier"".""Edgy"" can be a dangerous creative mixture with a show like Stargate. ""Edgy"" can mean daring, provocative, and/or avant-garde. But the nasty flip-side is that it can just as quickly turn into something unusual and unpleasant. And much of this ""Universe"" seemed forced and uncomfortable.Example: One early entry went something like this. ""OK, we have a room on board the Destiny that we are only now able to open and explore""... ""Oh look, its one of those Ancient's Chairs, I wonder where this will lead?"" We quickly find that it leads to an hour with an angry lesbian, a fist fight over infidelity, and ""Oh snot, my girlfriend is a stripper"".As the second-season cancellation decisively proved, this new and ""improved"" model was not the way to have gone. Yes, this was not ""your grandfather's Stargate"" but as it turned out it wasn't my teenage sons Stargate either. Those of us who wanted ""edgy"" adult science fiction got it from ""Battlestar Galactica"". Sometimes it is possible to ""break the mold"" and I feel this is exactly what MGM accomplished by hastily forcing this blend of science fiction together.And that's a shame. First off, because the 15 seasons of Stargate SG-1/Atlantis were unique, interesting and fun. It should never have ended so suddenly. Lastly, the second season of ""Universe"" seemed to start finding itself and showed some promise. It was just unfortunate that it couldn't survive the errors of the first season.I would have even accepted a couple stand-alone movies like ""Ark of the Truth"" and ""Continuum"" to have dealt with the season two cliff-hanger properly winding the show up. Though promised, I fear we will never see these. In a dorky way it would be cool to find a 10th Chevron that dialed the show back onto the airwaves.Note: You are right if you noticed that I did buy a copy of this DVD by ""Amazon's Verified Purchase"" notation. I confess. I love the Stargate franchise so much, and even though these two seasons are woefully inferior, there were cameos that forever connect it and therefore makes it necessary to have in the collection. I just waited till Amazon had a crazy sale to buy them."
78317,"These filters are made by a well-known manufacturer and have great quality, but the price is lower than buying the manufacturers equivalent name brand. Excellent quality."
78318,"I do not know why some companies think their movies are worth outrageous prices just to rent them for a short period of time...If we look at this rental, the actual purchase price would be well $60 for the movie on DVD...Please price these movies appropriately...nobody wants to rent movies at prices which they might buy it instead..."
78319,I use this on both my 2013 Hyundai Elantra GS and 2010 Yamaha Majesty. Gives a nice shine and reflection.
78320,"I got them for my Camry and they are perfect fit for front or rear seat head rests.Convenient to carry shirts from laundry, hang umbrella, wife's purse and grocery bags."
78321,Works good  better than the microfiber restorer product. This one leave them a lot softer and so much static. Next one is the griots garage one and see which is better
78322,"***** Update 5/21/13 *****I received a new unit, Perky Pet Model 210P, from Woodstream after I called their 800 number and reported this unit defective. They offered to replace it with a new unit of the same kind, but I asked if I could get something else since this design seemed so poor. They acknowledged that the 120TF has more issues than their other models and that they could make this change for me. SO, I received the more expensive 210P and I have to say it is just great. The food doesn't leak out. It has a glass vs. plastic reservoir which I believe will last longer. As a result, I would buy this brand, but avoid this model, the 120TF, and go for the 210P, which is also available on Amazon. The 210P doesn't have the ""push/pull valve feature"" but my experience is that this is more trouble than help. The 210P is more ""old school"" in its design, but is by far the better feeder. *****The up front review of this item is that my sample was non-functional and that I'm kinda stunned that the manufacturer would send a Vine reviewer something this obviously bad. I guess this speaks to the authenticity of the program in that this must have been a random unit pulled out and shipped to me. It was clearly not ""cherry picked"".So, what was so bad? I carefully cleaned the unit and dried it as recommended online. BTW, there were no instructions or hummingbird food included with my sample, so I had to go online for instructions for bird food, prepping the feeder, etc. After the feeder was dry, I re-assumbled it and made sure all parts were fitting as tightly as they can. I closed the feeder valve and opened the top to load it with my homemade ""nectar"" (=1 cup pure cane sugar stirred into 1 qt. boiled water and allowed to cool). I half filled the clear plastic reservoir and then closed the screw top lid. After hanging it in the appointed place, I carefully opened the valve to allow feeding. This allows the nectar to flow from the clear plastic reservoir to the red plastic feeding port area. Then, all the nectar started leaking out of the seam between the top and bottom halves of the red plastic feeding port (part with the plastic flowers). The top and bottoms halves of this shell have no rubber gasket or washer between then and have only a narrow plastic seam around the middle with a tiny ridge in it. This does NOT sit perfectly flush and has gaps as big as 1/32"" even after I tried to tweak it to be tight.So, it is not just an imperfect unit, in my opinion (I'm one of those truly ""Dilberted"" engineering types) it is really poorly designed. This is strange since the materials are not bad or cheap - they just had no common sense when designing this unit. It also appears that it could never have been well tested by anyone after initial design because I can't imagine that very many of these come off the line working properly. You would think the very first prototype batch would have failed so bad that they would have gone back and re-designed it.My brief online investigation shows that almost all other reviewers have had as bad an experience. So, why am I giving this horrible product two stars? The answer is the customer service. Since I'm a Vine reviewer, I always feel obligated to go another few yards (in not a mile) to see if the company will stand behind their products when one gets a clunker from them. The parent company of Perky Pet is Woodstream, and they put their toll free number on the bottom of the feeder. I called it and was channeled in non-geologic time (&lt; 5 minutes) to a friendly, US-based customer support person. They admitted that this particular unit ""had more problems reported than others"" that they make and were willing to send me a replacement. Since I believed that this would just result in getting another bad feeder, I asked if they could send me one that works better for equivalent value. YES! I quickly picked a high rated one off of Amazon, and they took my data down and committed to get it into UPS today. Wow! Very cool, very positive and upbeat response.When I get the new unit, I will report here and let you all know if the new feeder is the one to get or not."
78323,"Blue's Clues has been around for well over a decade, but this 90's gem still shines in contemporary times with content that rivals any other children's programming today.  Educational and at a level that is attractive to a wide range of ages, Blue's Clues is a staple for educational / enjoyable children's shows."
78324,"Works amazingly well in catching flies. I buy a few every year.The only problem is that plastic develops leaks after it is half-full of flies (which is a lot). Designed obsolescence, I suppose. But then you simply toss in the garbage. Great in controlling fly population."
78325,"This promises to be a woman's way in the ultimate boys club--the NFL.  The portrayal of the owners group is so funny it has to be true.  This isn't deep, it's just fun."
78326,"This hose could work out fine for some and be terrible for others. It would appear there are also some issues with quality control, so it could be hit or miss if your hose leaks or not as soon as you get it. So you may want to keep that in mind when considering which hose to purchase.Pros:Very light weight - This is great for someone like grandma/grandpa who wants to water their small backyard garden, but a traditional hose is too heavy for them to work with. No ones going to throw out their back lifting this, and it's weight would probably be very arthritis friendly.Size - Because it's an expanding hose, this means it contracts back up when water is not flowing through it. So 75 feet of this hose is not nearly as bulky as 75 feet of traditional hose.Cons:Water flow - The diameter of tube inside causes water flow to be lower than traditional hoses. Fine for watering the tomato plants, not so good for washing the car.Build quality - This hose seems much more delicate than traditional hoses. So if you want to make it last, it needs to be handled carefully and stored away out of the elements. In short, it needs to be babied. Not something most of us do with an item usually stored on the floor of our garage or rolled up on the ground in the backyard. A hot summer day with the kids playing around with it could be it's end.Conclusion:This hose will work for the person who needs a hose that is very light weight, and who is delicate with their stuff. My mother could make this hose last years since she takes such good care of her things, and it would be a good match for most of her needs (filling the bird bath, watering outside plants, etc). My husband trying to hose of his 4-wheeler and truck, and my kids using it to spray water on their friends would probably have this leaking and ruined in a week. With the build quality being not so great, I would suggest considering a different hose if you're not wanting to baby this."
78327,"Generally I'm not a fan of procedurals (shows without a continuing story, where each episode stands on it's own and isabout 'procedure'; legal, medical, etc), but this is as close to an exception as I'll get.Give credit to excellent writing, directing and acting, and having supporting characters that are rich and really addsomething to the show. When it's at it's best this can be downright terrific, bringing me to tears more than once, andmaking me laugh out loud a few times too. It can be very, very smart.While the 2nd season represented growth, mostly by focusing even more on our running characters and their ongoing stories,it can still be hit or miss. Every 3rd episode or so is really special.  That's a higher batting average than the first season.The other episodes are still good, almost always watchable, (one or two really don't work), but often you can see the twistscoming a mile off, or the jokes get a little stale.The show is at it's best when the episodes are really about the often funny, sometimes heartbreaking inner lives ofour running characters, and not simply about brilliantly (and inevitably) catching the bad guy/gal. Or when it's dealingwith the more human side of forensics - the grief and pain of those left behind. That's when this well made show moves waybeyond 'clever crime of the week' status."
78328,"While it lacked some of the strengths of the first season, season two of Elementary is still strong television. Perhaps too much emphasis of the season is place on the Mycroft storyline, the episodes of which are bunched together a bit too much, but the characters all develop nicely. Furthermore, the season also sets up Holmes to get out of doing the &#34;murder of the week&#34; routine in season three by giving him yet another potential source of employment."
78329,"perfect, have one on my truck and one on my wife's car, if you do your own changes this is a must. NO MORE HOT OIL ON MY ARMS!!!!!"
78330,"This was a cool drama with light humor.  I love all the characters, good and bad.  The story was well written and I think they made a big, bloody mistake discontiniuing it.  I hope they snap out of it and bring it back."
78331,"Urban fantasy series are currently undergoing a boom -- anything with vampires, werewolves and the like has an automatic audience.Enter ""Teen Wolf,"" which seems to be the lycanthropic counterpart to the ""Vampire Diaries"" -- lots of attractive teenage characters, secrets, violence, supernatural mysteries and some high-school romance. While the main character's werewolf form is incredibly unscary, the rest of the series is quite strong -- even if it does seem to use lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty.Weedy teenager Scott McCall (Tyler Posey) and his nerdy buddy Stiles (Dylan O'Brien) are prowling through a woods where a murder has recently occurred, and a large furry animal bites Scott. The following day, he finds that he's gained incredible senses, healing and agility -- which allows him to become the new star of the lacrosse team.Stiles claims Scott is a werewolf, but Scott ignores him... until he starts transforming in the middle of a date with a new girl in town, Allison (Crystal Reed). Another werewolf, Derek Hale (Tyler Hoechlin) takes Scott under his wing to educate him about how to control his lycanthropic urges, since anything that raises his heart rate can transform him at a moment's notice.Even worse: there are an ancient family of werewolf hunters in the area, and it turns out that Allison's dad and sadistic aunt are among them. Also, jock Jackson (Colton Haynes) is sniffing out Scott's secret.But Scott's high school woes soon become the least of his troubles. He was turned into a werewolf by an alpha -- a savage, bloodthirsty creature who is killing more people around the town. And somehow this rampage is connected to a fire that killed Derek's entire family several years ago. And if Scott doesn't join the alpha, the lives of everyone he loves will be endangered...""Teen Wolf"" hits a solid balance of teen romance, dark action, gore, horror and dry comedy. It's hard to get all those elements in the right proportions, but for the most part the series gets it right. The only problem is that a few episodes are a little too heavy on the teen soap opera romance (oh noes! Scott is making out with Jackson's girlfriend whom Stiles is also crushing on! ANGST! DRAMA!).But when the focus is on the werewolf stuff, ""Teen Wolf"" shines -- there's lots of growling, misty woods, and bloody violence, and the writers throw some curveballs at the audience (just who/what IS that vet?!). There's also an atmosphere of growing tension and darkness, which grows stronger as the season unfolds. Fortunately, the writers know how to leaven the story with plenty of humor, usually from Stiles (""What did I sound like to you?"" ""Like a cat being choked to death"").The special effects are a little dodgy. Some of them (like the alpha werewolf form) are decent, but the CGI werewolf maws are sometimes goofy-looking -- and the beta werewolf form is not scary AT ALL.The cast is pretty uniformly solid -- even seemingly-cliched characters like Lydia (the Queen Bee/Mean Girl), Chris Argent (Allison's scary werewolf-hunter dad) and Jackson (the arrogant jock who desperately wants to be a werewolf) are well-rounded, with excellent reasons for them to act and feel as they do. Posey, Hoechlin and O'Brien make a solid central trio as the earnest good boy, the tall-dark-and-brooding bad boy, and the nerdy sidekick respectively, and they all have excellent chemistry.""Teen Wolf"" has a few freshman wobbles, but overall it's a sleek, eerie story that balances action, romance and horror in equal measure. And it leaves you hungry for whatever is coming next for the teen wolf."
78332,"For the price, this works really well. I see no faults. It can unscrew pretty easily, but this is hardly a problem right now."
78333,"This compressor is small, light weight and very quite. It draws too much current for me to use my lighter outlet without possibly blowing a fuse so I bought a battery clip-on to lighter adapter to run it and it works perfectly. The air gauge doesn't report accurately while running, but is close. When you turn off the compressor it reports pressure accurately. The compressor has a screw-on hose tip and I loose almost no air when disconnecting it."
78334,Superb on every level. This is a keeper. &#34;Transparent&#34; reminds me of Robert Altman's films and I love Altman. I want more.
78335,I love all these true crime series on Investigation Discovery!  It's amazing at the amount of evil people there are out there.
78336,"I began watching Royal Pains one evening, and ended up enjoying it so much that I started purchasing it here.  It is an enjoyable series, and one I will continue to watch until the network is dumb enough to cancel it."
78337,"second season brings back all the favorite characters that make Longmire such a hit.  strong writing, interesting plots, unexpected twists."
78338,"However, it is a great series. Well written, great characters, not corny, but watch with an open mind.I am watching season two, that says it all."
78339,"I am very pleased with this purchase. This time of year (spring) I do a lot of transplanting and go through a ton of 3-inch and 4-inch pots and, to be honest, I'm sick of paying premium price for them. These pots are the exact same quality that you get in a garden center and they were much cheaper. They came nicely bundled and packaged and I'm very happy with them. Buy with confidence."
78340,The design and pattern matches exactly with the ones that came with the JK.  I like it much better than the previous one that I had tried.  It is flexible even in the cold winter.This particular mat is not shaped to allow for the sub-woofer. Fortunately the rubber is soft and when I get around to working on it I will trace the subwoofer shape and trim it to fit.
78341,"I used this product around my home and it does everything everyone else said it would do. The only thing I wasn't sure of was the weight of the unit and holding the product for about 45 minutes to an hour with the maximum length of 14', but I got used to it. I believe the amount of time for the battery is about 45"" to 1 hour which was great and meant I could stop after that time. Works out perfectly for us older guys."
78342,"I love this hummingbird feeder.  The top is made of red glass that has a vintage style. It is quite beautiful!  (I get a lot of complements.)  I also have the company's older version which is smaller and made of clear glass.  I have to say that they have made some really nice improvements.First of all, they have increased the bottle size so you can fill it up with more sugar water.  Since the bottle is also heaver and larger it also makes the feeder more stable.  My smaller feeder has trouble tilting or falling over.  Also, while my clear feeder is very pretty, the hummingbirds just aren't as attracted to it so I had to add a couple red bows.  Since the new one is bright red.  It makes a fantastic beacon for hummingbirds!  The only real pain is cleaning and refilling the bottle since you can't keep the sugar in the feeder too long."
78343,"A must have tool to work on any car, if your check or fixing electrical problems, it makes the connecting and disconnecting that much easier, and you don't have to break anything with this tool!!"
78344,"I am disappointed, once again, an excellent show with to notch acting is cancelled. We have more than enough 'realty' shows and not enough for those of us that want some form of entertainment that displays the abilities of actors rather than people making fools of themselves."
78345,"Who doesn't love these tuners?  Easy to use, easy to read, and has options that I don't even use. Highly recommend this."
78346,"I was using Turtle Wax &#34;black box&#34;, which is also great... but this single application product from meguiar's is really fantastic.  As with all liquid(ish) wax, let it dry... let it dry a long time.... and you're going to get great results."
78347,"A very charming if not slighly disarming twist on an old tale.  Sherlock is not your typical consulting detective in this one.  When he had only one hour to be released formally from rehab, he releases himself.  Watson, a retired doctor now is a live in rehab counselor, and imspector Gregson (a character from The Red Headed League) is a police leut. in NYPD.  Yep, not your typical Holmes but all the more reasons to enjoy it."
78348,"Let me begin with a Public Service Announcement: If you want to buy other EZDrummer expansion packs, YOU NEED TO BUY THIS PRODUCT FIRST!***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Toontrack is scheduling the public release of EZ Drummer 2.0 in May 2014. If you buy EZ Drummer 1.0 from now until then, you will ALSO get the download for 2.0. Bear in mind, EZD2 is a completely new/different program from EZD1, and so I would jump on this opportunity considering you get the stock EZD1 Pop/Rock Kit (which has some very kit pieces) in addition to the EZD2 default kit (which is more reminiscent of the ROCK! expansion kit from what I've seen). EZ Drummer 2.0 also gives you the ability to mix/mash kit pieces from all expansions, and so to me this makes EZ Drummer a MUST BUY based on the sheer customization available. ***RESUME NORMAL PROGRAMMING***If you are an amateur musician and you want a quality virtual drum kit, EZDrummer is probably the best bang for the buck you'll find. It's very easy to use, very easy to program, and overall a well made product. You might be tempted to compare EZDrummer to its bigger and better brother: Superior Drummer 2.0, made by the same company. Superior Drummer is superior to EZDrummer, but is a little more tedious and more suitable for musicians who want an exact close-to-life sounding virtual instrument.There are ways to improve the off-the-shelf sound quality of EZDrummer immediately. YouTube has plenty of video tutorials on this, but what you want to do is open up your Digital Audio Workstation (Pro Tools, Cubase, etc), and set EZDrummer for multi-track output. From there you'll be able to tweak the different outputs EZDrummer has as if you were in a studio and had 7 mics at your disposal. Most high-end professional studios use about 10 mics to capture everything on a drum kit, and so 7 virtual mics is nothing to scoff at: Kick Drum, Snare Top and Bottom, Toms, Cymbals, Overhead, and Room. Once you have each of those outputs running, you can perform individual EQs to change the tone dramatically. Adding a touch of distortion/gain and room reverb will make the stock kit sound REALLY close-to-life. In reality, once you have additional instruments layered and everything mixed and balanced, it only takes a trained ear to tell that it's a virtual kit.As far as the expansions go, if you are looking to record a particular style of music, then I highly recommend buying the EZX kit that goes with that genre. The stock Rock kit is VERY GOOD (after performing the mods above)... but only for Rock. As for me personally, I did my best to EQ and tweak the crap out of it to get a nice metal tone, but in the end, I found the Rock kit lacking, especially since it's a ""tight"" kit (3 toms, 3 cymbals, 1 hi-hat, 1 snare, 1 kick)."
78349,"The look of this strap caught my eye, I have a light colored natural look to my acoustic guitar and the blue complements it really well. The design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud. Strong build, sort of a double layered nylon strap, and nice thick leather for the ends(one end was actually pretty difficult to put on the guitar when still new, but it should be easier with some wear). Easy to adjust, comfortable. I think that with many things you get what you pay for, and this strap is definitely worth the added cost over the cheap kinds you can get."
78350,"I purchased these for my little pedal board ""The stepping stone"".THese are very well made with the heads well secured. The plastic is thick and of a nice material.The cables come with a massive 5 year warranty so I'm sure they're not going bad anytime soon.Buy with confidence."
78351,"The neighbor&#8217;s cat likes to sleep on my protected front porch (on my white upholstered bench) every time it rains, leaving muddy paw prints and cat hair.  I&#8217;ve been using an orange oil spray to keep him off the cushion, but I was in hopes this Ortho product would have longer effect.  On the good side, this stuff doesn&#8217;t have a strong scent and it doesn&#8217;t smell at all bad.  The sprayer works well and emits a slimy, bubbly, almost-clear liquid.  However, it has no effect at all and the cat didn&#8217;t hesitate to jump on the cushion and comfortably curl up almost immediately after I sprayed the area.  If it stunk up my porch I would have given one star but, because the odor is benign, I&#8217;m giving two.  I&#8217;ve gone back to using orange oil & water which works much better!"
78352,"I bought this to lubricate both the ball of my hitch as well as the weight distribution bars for my RV.  It works great, and a little bit is all you need so this should last me a decade of use.  I was getting excessive squeaking from my weight distribution bars, which was eliminated once I added this to the bar heads.  And for the ball, I am no longer getting excessive grinding.  I use a trailer ball cover when not towing and wrap the bars with plastic bags to avoid getting the grease on clothing when not in use."
78353,"its sound pretty good .. i mean , the range /rate arent as broad as others i've tried ..but i stomp on it regularly.. it cuts my signal a bit .. so i compensate ,,an always leave a bit of extra volume in the bank to make it up..all in all=worth it."
78354,"Great DVD, includes all of the episodes of Season 15 of South Park. The perfect gift for any true South Park fan. The episodes are great and anyone who enjoys the show would love this DVD!"
78355,"Perfect blend of comedy and drama in a Sci-Fy show. After watching all the Deleted scenes and Outakes, we put in Season 1 and started all over again."
78356,Adventure and the realitys of true life come together with a dramatic end for the Ponds and the power of love.
78357,handy. cheaper than using real sockets and adapters. just right for taking a 10 minute crank-down task and turn it into a 2 minute task.
78358,This show is incredible.  Finally a well-written storyline that hooks you immediately!!  Damian Lewis does a phenominal job. I liked him instantly and have consistently watched as his character grows. Life has excellent script writing.  I really enjoy this show and hope it continues.  Life requires viewers to actually have a brain as it stimulates deep thought!!  WONDERFUL!  Keep it coming!!!!
78359,"I'm very pleased with this nozzle.  It has a wide variety of patterns to choose from, but more importantly it doesn't leak.  I can't stand it when nozzles leak.  I liked this one so much I ordered another one for a different hose."
78360,"I have used nearly every wax on the market and this is the easiest I have used. This is one I can trust on old finishes that you are scared your old carnauba will just become a part of. Easy on, easy off."
78361,"I bought this to try at my parents' cabin.  They have a major problem with deer eating their ornamental plants, specfically tiger lillies and hostos (or is it hostas).This particular product is nice because it the sprayer is battery operated.  So my parents like the convenience.Now for the disadvantages... I'd rather smell my own flatuence after chilli than smell this. It's awful.  But, then again many other chemical sprayers reek.  Also, this is not a set it and forget option.  You need to pay a lot of attention and reapply.  Lastly, you cannot use it for plants that will bear fruit or vegetables for consumption.All and all it's a new twist on an old concept.  I'd use it again."
78362,This show was fun to watch and inspiring for people who like to recycle.  I don't know why HGTV didn't make more episodes.
78363,This was one of the shows that was cancelled that should have not been. Was a great show for action and drama. With a few laughs.
78364,"--------------------------------------------""The Cave Of Forgotten Dreams""(Directed by Werner Herzog, 2011)--------------------------------------------Given unprecedented access to the Chauvet Cave, a vast archeological repository located in the south of France, legendary director Werner Herzog and a minimal crew of four crawl through tunnels and balance on delicate metal catwalks, filming the extraordinary and breathtaking cave paintings found within. Herzog designed a lightweight, portable 3D camera, small enough to be brought into the cavern, so that he could capture the ways in which the ancient artists of Chauvet used the natural contours of the cave walls to enhance their artwork.  Although often rough technically, it is the most meaningful use of 3D cinematography I have ever seen, placing viewers inside the space of the cave in a way that seems magical and unreal.The Chauvet cave paintings were made over 30,000 years ago, depicting predatory animals such as bears and lions, as well as bison, rhinos, mammoths and perhaps most striking of all, a wall of beautifully rendered horses.  The spiritual and artistic presence of these paintings is almost overwhelming, embued with primal, primordial history and an astonishing technical and aesthetic command: these pictures are both evocative and beautiful.  Herzog approaches them reverently, and delights in their mystery, often shooting them in half-shadow or using moving, flickering light to suggest the rude torches used by their creators as well as the complete, total darkness that shrouded these powerful pictures for untold millennia. Throughout the film he intones in a soft European murmur, musing about the nature of human consciousness and the relationship of this ancient artwork to our own modern sensibilities: how much of the aesthetic and world view of this primitive culture do we carry about with us today?  Some viewers may find the intellectualism and pretensions hard to take (as well as the often intrusive but oddly affecting score...) yet it is hard to deny the power of the subject.You or I will never be able to go inside these caves -- they are closely guarded by the French government -- but in Herzog's film we can become immersed in them. Leaving the theater, walking in sunshine or under electric lights, you may marvel at the wonders that thirty thousand years of human life have brought - the works of stone and steel, plastic and glass, the layer upon layer of habitation and roads, the planes in the sky and the optical magic that brings art to life in films such as this. And, like Herzog and his crew, you may find yourself swept up by the connections we still have to the stunning pictures that lay hidden inside a dark cave for far more time than civilization itself... it is truly miraculous.A highly recommended, deeply moving film - for the full effect see it in the theaters, if you can.  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)"
78365,Long and drawn out! Worst Jason Statham movie to date. Just didn't seem to go anywhere. One of those movies  you keep watching hoping something is going to happen...It doesn't
78366,"The series has undergone many changes over time.  I liked Father Vincent.  He brought a more down to earth approach to his ministry.  The ending leaves you with the feeling that all would be well, if it had been a real story about a small community.  Overall the series was very entertaining."
78367,"I like most of the Post-Apocalyptic movies and TV series.  This one has potential based on the handful of episodes they have shown so far.  As long as they don't get to weird like Fringe eventually did or to brazen like Torchwood became then it probably won't shoot itself in the foot like them.  The story is based on a man (alien war veteran) and his daughter (adopted alien?) driving to St. Louis and settling there after a devastating war has destroyed most everything or at least put some serious damage on them (St. Louis Arch with a few pieces damaged or missing).  After the previous marshal is killed our hero takes over in his place. Some interesting plots are developing concerning the future of the cities development, family politics and love interests, and potential enemies of the status quo.  If you like SciFi I recommend you check it out.CA Luster"
78368,"I found this product very easy to install -- easy to cut, easy to apply, and easy to trim after application. Sticks nicely as well (otherwise it would not do much sound deadening!)Be warned ... you'll probably need more than you think. I used it on my 1999 Silverado, to help dampen the sound resonation. I did not cover the holes in the inner door panel because (1) I wanted to see how well it worked solely as a dampener and not a blocker, and (2) I wanted to leave the access holes as they are, for now, due to some upcoming body work to be done. In this way, one box covered nicely the back door and most of the passenger front door. I would have needed at least one more box to cover the holes in the inner skin on these two doors, maybe two.Does it work? Yes. Even with the limited use, it dampened the sound. It also makes the back door sound more solid when closing.Will I buy more? Yes. Once the body work is done, I will do a full inner skin cover. It will be easy, as the way it sticks I don't have to remove the pieces already installed. I'll just leave them and cut more to fill the holes.I have never used competing products so I cannot comment on them, but this seems to be a nice alternative to the well-known DynaMat. It is a good thickness and it is very easy to use. Won't add much weight to your car either."
78369,"The one and only time I've had a rodent inside my home it was almost impossible to get rid of.  I placed sticky traps and wooden traps to no avail.  The critter would trip the wooden traps every night but managed to stay out of harms reach.  I could see evidence of he/she being caught by the sticky trap but once again managed to get off.  I was beginning to feel like I had a mouse with a PhD in escaping from traps.A friend recommended that I try Motomco Bait Station.  I placed these underneath my kitchen sink, in my laundry room and in bathrooms.  After a few days I could tell something was eating the bait.  I have not seen any evidence of mice in my home since beginning using these.Now, I don't wait until I see the evidence of rodents inside my house before placing traps and poisons.  I place bait stations underneath my house, in and under my storage shed and inside my tool shed and check regularly and replace if needed.The company claims these are pet safe and child resistant.  My children are grown and I don't have pets.  I did attempt to pry the top off and was unable to do so.Motomco Bait Stations work.  I highly recommend them for getting rid of mice.  As the old saying goes, ""An Ounce of Prevention is worth a Pound of Cure""-Benjamin Franklin"
78370,"I can't say I'm a polish connoisseur, but this stuff seems to work very well.  It shined up all my instruments and got rid of all those nasty fingerprints and smudge marks.  I'm not very diligent in my guitar maintenance, so this bottle should last me for years."
78371,"It has everything...heart, funny, action. What more do you need? As I said, It is one of my favorite new shows~~"
78372,"I'm a fan of discovery ID and love their shows. This show Stolen Voices Buried Secrets is a good show, it's another real life show detailing information from crimes committed  from the victims who are dead. It's being told from the dead victims  point of view. It's a new show that perimered in January 2011 and the episodes that I have seen so far are interesting. Would recommend."
78373,It waa amazing. It had the feel of the movie of 300 but better because it wasnt all about action scenes and killing. It has a great story too. Great cast I never heard of and the sex scenes are intense.
78374,"Good series. Held my attention enough to want to see all the episodes. Enjoyed the characters, actors and stories. Giving it 3 stars because it was enjoyable, but doesn't hold up to better, seasoned British shows such as Prime Suspect."
78375,"Perfect replacement.  Did have to take off a little on either side, but other than that it fits.  I used it on a First Act ME501."
78376,"Great Show!  Nerds and Spooks.  It's the perfect partnership.  Chuck, a Stanford drop out, working at the Buy More, gets an  email from his sort of best friend.  The email contains current and past U.S. intelligence.  The email imprints all this data into Chuck's memory.  Soon after, Chuck meets Sara and falls head over heals for her.  It turns out, she is his handler, and charged with keeping him safe, and the information intact.  This is the story of how Chuck grows out of being just a Nerd Herder, to a real spy with the help of friends, family, the CIA, and Sara.  It's a story of nerds, love, action, and comedy.  We love it."
78377,This episode started out pretty normal and then ended up being a powerfully moving episode. This is a great TV show!
78378,I like the Parking Wars series but the amazon video is just not as high quality as what I watch on Netflix.
78379,Just good old ghost hunting at its best . I think ghost hunting should be about gathering evidence of the paranormal. Not so much entertaining the audience but rather explaining the how and why ghost are there and trying to prove it.
78380,The whole series was great. It showed how military teams work together and have each others back.  It also showed how the wives help and support  each other. I would recommend this series to anyone.
78381,"I didn't like my previous Bosch Icon blades. They always seemed to streak. Switching it out with this cheaper blade, so far this one seems to be working much better, plus it's cheaper. The connectors on the Icon seem a bit nicer, but the clear advantage went on very easily and still seems as secure as any other blade. Hopefully the performance of this blade will hold up better than the Icon did."
78382,"I've had my hose haphazardly on the ground for 2 summers now, so this was just what I needed! When it arrived I was surprised by how heavy it was. Super heavy duty, well made with solid construction. Easy to attach to the house and attractive, especially since my house has green trim. I use my hose all over the yard, about 180 degrees around and it was always hard for me to yank it over to where I need it. I love that this reel swivels around but locks if I want. Now, it's really easy and enjoyable to water my plants. Also, the little shelf on top really came in handy so I don't lose little odds and ends when I'm working in outside. Really happy with this hose reel!!"
78383,My two year old really loves this show.  Even my seven year old likes to watch them.  It teaches team work.
78384,"I like the fact that the stories are taken from records, diaries, and other memorabilia. The costuming and scenery make it very authentic. The scripts are good and the acting is good! Well spent time in front of the television!"
78385,Took away my fingerprints and dust off my guitar and polished it to a shine that you couldn't see a reflection in yourself!
78386,I bought this to replace my lost O2 sensor socket. These worked great on my OEM O2 sensor and my UEGO wideband sensor I installed. Those things are expensive to replace so using the right tool makes it so you don't have to worry about rounding off the weak socket or stripping it. They also allow you to connect to a torque wrench and get the sensor to the proper torque specs.
78387,Each episode builds up after one another and keeps me interested. Gets you to talk about how the characters are and secretive some if them are.
78388,"Works as good as any other clay bar I've used, and the bag it comes in has a zip-loc style resealing strip on it, which is nice. I think I prefer lighter colored clays, though, since removed contaminants show up better."
78389,"I love these guys for detailing our cars.  They're small (not too small) and can get in just about everywhere and don't force me to try to use my big brushes and towels on fine work.  Especially for doing grills and around windows and what not.  Buy them, you wont be sorry."
78390,"I don't know quite what I was expecting,but this first episode was ok, but not particularly entertaining. It wasn't really bad, so maybe others will like it more than I did."
78391,"This season 3 of Manhunters was very interesting and exciting.  I liked all the &#34;real&#34;  U.S. Marshals and police agency's out of NY and NJ.  They risked their lives to take down the bad guy's.  All in all it was good, fast action.  The one thing that slowed it down was when the exact same words and show were repeated...like they spliced the film together where a commercial probably came in on the TV version."
78392,"*Some spoilers ahead, read at your own caution*Before the first word is spoken, I'm given the impression that this is just like the previous V/H/S, in that there's next to no real story in the main story, just excuses to have women take their tops off and have people swear very heavily. Then a touch of story does appear. A young man being sought out by private investigators and find that he's missing... and instead find a collection of strange videotapes. Unlike the previous collection, something strange will be happening in the interweaving narrative of the main story. The anthology on the other hand...Phase I Clinicals seemed like a total rip-off of The Eye, where someone gets an eye implant after an accident and, because it's a new method, is warned there may be glitches. Those glitches include being able to see ghosts. The only person that knows of them besides the patient is a woman (who, besides her knowledge and her cochlear implant, seems like she's only useful in the story for a sex scene). Frankly, this is the only story that actually gave me jump scares. But still, this seemed too mainstream with overt predictability throughout.A Ride in the Park is basically nothing more a first-person view of zombies. A man riding his bike gets attacked by a zombifying woman and becomes one himself, who ends up attacking a cuple after he dies. Sadly, when said biker and couple meet together, they look clumsily/comically cheesy, stiffly moving. It would likely get Romero to roll his eyes. That said, there was less than a handful of moments (in the end) that gave this a hint of originality- no, wait, it actually made me think of David Moody's Hater trilogy (where you get a glimpse of zombies through their own point of view).Safe Haven is a documentary-style video of a trio getting into a cult compound (think Jim Jones meets Heaven's Gate meets eastern philosophy). Most of it is in some Indian dialect (don't know which one), with a few lines here and there in English. During an interview, a woman speaks of a secret that only one of the interviewers knew of and that unravels secrets about each other, which inadvertently connect to the biggest secret of the cult's Father. Overall, it was the most disturbing (even if it didn't have any jump scares) because of sleights to pedophilia and how it deals with suicide cults and religious extremism.Slumper Party Alien Invasion seems to have a feeling that's reminiscent of a mix of old-school Spielberg and King. A group of kids, after messing with one of the kids's big sister and her boyfriend, end up having to defend their selves against an alien invasion. Paradigm shift? The camera, towards the end, goes to the perspective of a camera hooked to the family dog's back, so when it ends, it does so in a completely depressing way.In between each video is the main story being played out in bits, but each bit does have a better story than the nonexistent crap that served as the main story in the previous movie. Though, in a way, it seemed like they picked their cues from The Ring and Pulse. In fact, it seemed like there was authentic originality in any of the stories herein. If they make a sequel, I do hope for actual originality, a pretty decent storyline, and videos where women don't simply serve as lust factors but as actual human beings (it's become a cliche for a woman to bare her chest in a horror movie, but I don't think the people who made this know that).Overall: 1.5/5"
78393,"Lovely animation with just enough familiar characters and songs from the original Mr. Roger's Neighborhood to make it a joy to watch for parents and toddlers alike. Cute rhymes that stick in your mind like, &#34;When you have to go potty, stop and go right away. Flush and wash and be on your way.&#34; are great reminders for little ones about the right way to do things."
78394,"This is actually a painful movie to watch and although the Richard character is truly disturbing ifnot despicable, the others are pretty well not worth watching at all.  There is so much drug and alcoholuse that the humanity is erased from the film.  Awful.  Do not bother unless you yourself are part ofthis drug culture that's being portrayed."
78395,"Very heavy duty and should work just as advertised in soft sand, soil, mud, etc. Haven't actually used it yet but fully expect that it will live up to its claims! Hi-Lift is a great company and I will continue to buy their products."
78396,"This is a really fun and quirky show! Still not sure who is my favorite character yet, I like each of them for their uniqueness!"
78397,"I like the show, but it moves too slowly.  There are like 3 episodes and they call it a season. Then I have to wait a year to find out what's next. Pretty frustrating. I will wait until the entire series is over and then watch them all in the same day. Not sure what the trouble is, but there should 8 - 9 episodes a year.  Also the plot is drifting. Fighting and acting scenes very good."
78398,"It was a disappointment. I gave it a few episodes to get into it, but it didn't get any better."
78399,"The final season of The Office was very good, in my opinion.Gone was Robert California. Also, the absence of Ed Helms due to other projects (I guess) was ver well handled.There were some very good ideas, like the documentary crew appearing in some scenes (one of them protecting Pam from being attacked).The extras are very good, showing some audition, blooper reel, etc.All in all, one of the best shows I've ever watched."
78400,Great series and enjoyable to watch.I like how math is used to help solve the different cases.The characters are really down to earth and this series showed life outside the F.B.I.office. Mike
78401,"I used to purchase these from Honda directly but they charge around $20. For $12, I can find no difference between this product and the OEM."
78402,RANDOM ENCOUNTERSSERENDEPITOUS! Basically the same story with a different angle of Serendipity the Movie with John Cusak and Kate Beckinsale in 2001. Both  movies very enjoyable.
78403,"The first few seasons had the cast actually discussing rather interesting topics while they solved various homicides, but the objective tone has switched to narrow minded subjective babble"
78404,"These are intended to be used with the Hi-Lift jack, and thus fit perfectly.  Easy to mount on any 1 to 2 inch tube.  Very secure. I do wish that they would have included a safety chain that would make me feel just a little more confident in them.  I added my own safety chain, one can never be too cautious."
78405,wonderful!!!! great characters!  Grant Bowler is fabulous in this show!! Julie Bentz is a great mayor and the action is fabulous!!
78406,"Light fair.  Lewis has matured and is a better officer.  Hathaway a good fit.  No gratuitous violence, less abusive language, soft undercurrents, and some lighthearted banter to get us thru.  A winner for mystery."
78407,"At the time of writing this, the product information is wrong on Amazon's product page.The following is said on Amazon's product page:Tomcat Mole and Gopher has a unique bottle design for easy applicationReady-to-use pelleted baitNot for sale in north Carolina or New HampshireActive ingredient Zinc PhosphatePelleted bait per bottleA mild laxative for the lubrication of the intestinal tract.For use on horses, cattle, sheep, swine, and dogs.MINERAL OIL - SIZE: 1 GALLONThe information about this product being a mild laxative for lubrication for horses, cattle sheep, swine and dogs is incorrect and for a completely different product. This product is a bait for moles and pocket gophers and will kill animals. Hopefully Amazon will change the information soon. I will update this as soon as the information is corrected.The Tomcat Mole & Gopher Bait is a Zinc Phosphide based bait and comes in a very handy application bottle. The shape of the bottle is intended for poking holes into the active burrows so you can a tsp. Amount of the bait into the hole. The bait looks like rat or mouse bait. These types of pelleted baits look like many feeds like our mini pig's so be sure and keep away from pets."
78408,I love Kevin Bacon and loved the suspense of this show!  Had me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait until the next season!
78409,"Season 4 complemented the prior 3 very well.  Plots are consistently intricately woven, always a few surprises.As this is the last season (available at least), I'm hoping it will continue.If you like the fast talking, Sherlock Holmes style, in-depth analysis in solving murders, then you will enjoy this series.  Actors are well above average for TV Drama and I highly recommend the show."
78410,"We have quite a few squirrels that love the pecans in our pecan tree.  That is why I wanted to try this product.  We also have deer that come into the garden and partake of the bounty.  I don't begrudge the deer a meal but not all of their meals have to be from our little garden :)My husband took the product and sprayed around the perimeter of the yard where the squirrels play, around the pecan tree and around the garden.  We were not distressed by the smell at all.  It was hardly noticable to us.The battery powered sprayer worked like a dream.  Wonderful tool for the task!As to how it works....I believe it really does help to keep the critters away.  We waited several days to see results.  In the garden there were no new deer tracks, so I believe that helped a lot.  As for the squirrels, I haven't seen any in the pecan tree where we sprayed right around the base.  It is separate from the other trees in our yard.  However, I have seen squirrels up in the other trees on the higher limbs.  I think it keeps them out of the yard but I think it does not keep them from jumping from tree to tree on the higher branches.  Luckily the pecan tree is far enough away from other trees so they cannot jump to its branches, steal the nuts and jump back.I think the product itself is good.  You have to consider the environment you are using it in and the habits of the creatures...such as jumping squirrels.  We have not had a problem with rabbits so I do not know how it works with them.Overall I think the product does what it says it will do...I also think the squirrels can adapt if you have a lot of trees together."
78411,"With Season 6 we find Shane in a conundrum over happenings from Season 5.  To make matters worse, Shane and Vic are at odds.The writing is still tight but the camaraderie between the Strike Team is very, VERY loose.  In the end, Vic and Aceveda form an alliance that benefits each other -- for the time being.Even though at this point the series has run the gamut and is heading for an end, it is still 'must see' viewing.  Like a soap opera of life unfolding in front of your face, The Shield and Farmington Division are part of an effort for FX to provide very sharp work to the masses.Great job to those folks who were believers of the network before it had a chance to fold."
78412,"Water and polishing agents are emulsified with detergent in this pump spray car cleaner.  Simply spray it on aZwipeor other microfiber cloth, wipe on a small section of exterior, and buff with a dry microfiber cloth.  Imagine your car is a large coffee table and you get the idea.The polish component is a blessing and a curse.  It shines up great, but if there is more than a thin film of dirt, it inhibits cleaning because the polish ingredients will not dissolve dirt.This is a great spit shine product, and there is nothing wrong with that.  Use it before your car is grimy and use it often.  Not only do you not have to use up water, you do not have to drag out buckets and hoses.  This is very convenient!TIPS:  If your car is filthy, you need to wash it with conventional methods.  If it is starting to get grimy, you can clean it very well with microfiber cloths and plain water or water and white vinegar.  You will not get the high shine, but this works better for heavier dirt.  Just put water in a plastic spray bottle, fire at will, wait a few seconds for it to dissolve the grime and wipe off.Do not use any product that contains polish and/or wax to clean mirrors or windows because they distort visibility.  Use a mister with water/vinegar (you can add a drop of dish detergent) and your microfiber orSqueegee."
78413,I've watched all the seasons and wish there were more. I like Foyles style of detective work and  plots which can be several intertwined in an episode.
78414,"I always thought that Celts were strictly an Irish/Welch group of people.  After all, Gaelic is only used in the Ireland area now.  But to my surprise Celts were in Europe too!  What an interesting series.  Glad I watched it."
78415,"My big problem with this film is that it simply does not flow. It's like a composition that meanders all over the place and does not fully explore any thesis. Characters do things which one simply wouldn't do in real life. If I was a graduate student at Oxford, I surely wouldn't drop the ""F"" bomb on a Don whom I want to become my mentor. Romantic relationships appear ""out of the blue."" Some characters disappear into thin air and the plot is so disjointed that I felt the whole thing was a waste of time. It's a pity because the trailer looked good and Lenora Watling is certainly easy to look at, but Elijah Wood is just plain HORRIBLE and quite frankly, other than her looks, Ms. Watling doesn't impress much either. Hurt spends his time pontificating and the whole thing is a jumble. Don't bother with it."
78416,"This was larger than I thought it would be. I haven't used it yet, but I can tell it will be PERFECT for transplanting plants, and re-potting. I'm very excited to get some dirt in it."
78417,"After watching the end of Season 5 of Supernatural, I was excited to find another supernatural-type show--this time, set in a beautiful little town in Maine.That excitement only goes so far.  The female lead's only strength is her open-mindedness to the supernatural; her male co-stars bring unique characters that bring varying amounts of worth to the story; the writing is not as strong as one would hope for a show that's trying to get itself off the ground...and by the third episode, I shouldn't feel that the show is formulaic.Little glimpses into each character's past improve the show now and then, such as Audrey's association with a woman from the past (who may or may not be her brother), Nathan's inability to feel pain and his branding as a freak by some members of the town, and Duke's, well...Dukishness.If the writing improves, the characters are properly developed, and the story diverges from ""he-didn't-realize-he-had-superpowers-and-is-hurting-people"", this could be a winner."
78418,"The compactf design of this tuner makes it easy to take with you to lessons, school, or a gig.  Works well."
78419,"So had to get one for the new rv....With two grey tanks and one filling quickly and the galley tank filling slowly,I put this on the end of the twist on waste valve to protect it."
78420,Just bought season one and have been watching it nonstop. The acting is great holds your interest. The actors are all beautiful. One of my favorite shows now.
78421,"I would have given this five stars but the connections loosen with use and I have had to hand tighten the connection right beneath the scarecrow head a couple of times.  I use the two scarecrows to scare critters from our newly created garden pond.  I bought the two scarecrows along with Yard Sentinel's RC Ultrasonic Pest Controller.  They work in unison and are effective!  I have the Yard Sentinel set to only operate after dark for raccoons and any other four-legged critter.  Everything has remained undisturbed.  And, I did not put on the yellow stickers so they are solid black and (to me) less obtrusive.  This was a great investment."
78422,"I think it's technically a documentary ... it reviews all the wacky conspiracy theories about the so-called brilliance of The Shining.  These narrators have a messianic view of Stanley Kubrik and The Shining, claiming the movie is an allegory for everything from the holocaust to the moon landing.I would have liked to see the faces of these Shining experts on-camera, because I have a feeling they're total weirdos."
78423,"I bought these to take care of a mosquito larvae problem in my bog garden. They work well and the frogs are not bothered by them at all. I have a few rare green frogs in the bog here and the dunks don't harm them at all. This particular package, however, was very dry and it seemed like they just crumbled after hitting the water. It does not reduce their effectiveness at killing larvae, but it's not a very attractive result, especially if you have water lilies or water plants. You end up with a lot of bits of cork floating around and getting all over everything. Guess that's better than a bunch of mosquitoes, but..."
78424,"This show is starting to loose its apeal to viewers. I have trouble getting through it, guess its hard to keep this series alive with new material."
78425,"I previously had the UCA-202 and it worked great for me for a couple of years but I noticed the audio went dead in one of the RCA phono input jacks (I had used those jacks previously with no issues). Regardless, I liked the UCA-202 so much that I got the UCA222 to replace it without hesitation, plus as a bonus, it's purdier! :)  Plugged it in just now, fired up the PC, the new UCA222 started working immediately...no muss, no fuss!  For the money, I don't think you can find a better deal for enhancing your PC's audio versatility.  I don't know if I'll even bother with the included software as I use a great program called Mixcraft (btw, check that out if you're looking for PC recording simplicity but sounds impressive as the other, costlier guys). Anyway, two thumbs way up for the UCA222!"
78426,I guess any PBS-NOVA program will be 5 stars to someone.  I don't even remember the name of the program Amazon is referring to.
78427,I'm a romantic... so I wish the ending were different.  Maybe.. just maybe.. if I wish... Amazon will create another episode.... people who didn't come back would... no spoiler... I'm just saying..Very enjoyable pre-teen movie.
78428,"Since BMW does not make their own filters, I'm pretty sure they source it from the same supplier. Mann filters are well made, but priced a lot less than BMW original parts."
78429,"They are loose fitting but do not appear stretchable as the advertising suggests. If I use them to train a planted small shrub or tree for instance, I will need to remember to remove them as the tree grows so not to choke growth. Maybe they will break as the trunk or branch they are attached to grows but I'll certainly have a problem removing them at that time and I'd rather not be proven right. So I'm back to my Gardener's Blue Ribbon Stretch tape which I would need to have on hand anyway for any larger staked plant.The one place where the Global Garden Clips are a right solution is with my Desert Rose (Ademium). These like most succulent plants, Jades,giant sunflowers, and euphorbia are top heavy and have a tendency to bend and topple from the top weight. Also clematis and other vines can get top heavy as they grow and start tumbling. The clips can unobtrusively anchor and support the weight to allow the plant or vine to bring me continued joy in my garden.At the time of this review, the per clip cost is just over 50 cents apiece. Ouch!With 20 in a bag, the global Garden Plant Clip is an expensive solution for securing a plant. So unless, the plant is decorative and I want to make a statement at my entrance door or patio or it's a particular favorite vine that I enjoy from a favorite window, I'm back toGardener's Blue Ribbon 150 ft Sturdy Stretch Tie T007A.  What's important to you and your application will determine if this is a right solution in your life."
78430,"This sound reduction matting material from 3M is a thick, pliable, self-adhesive sheet.  The dense material dampens sound waves and vibrations.  It comes rolled and the sheet is perforated down the middle.  It is very malleable and will adapt to fit around stereo components and fill cracks or holes.This product is really intended only for people with experience installing audio equipment in vehicles and is not ideal to be used under a fan or blender where it will be visible.  It does still function but it is slightly tarry and hard to keep clean."
78431,"It was a funny movie. I liked it. It is not the best movie I have every seen, but on the whole it was quite enjoyable."
78432,"In my garage my wife's SUV's left rear door hits the left front fender of my car with the very corner which is above the wheel, and I already have 4 dents to remember my wife by.  To avoid the 5th dent I decided to try this film.The film softens the hit, but, I think, there is still a very good possibility that the door's corner will make that dreaded fifth dent in my fender.  Basically, the film protects the door edge from chipping, but does very little to protect another vehicle's body in cases when your car's door hits another car.  I think that, unfortunately, no matter how much I dislike those short fat tube looking door edge guards, I will have to get one of them for my wife's SUV to protect my car.On the positive side, the film was easy to apply, just make sure to clean surfaces first.  However, it is quite expensive at ten bucks for two doors.As a note, both of our cars are black, so I do not think it is an issue for us, however, based on my experience with clear door guards and any ""stick-ons"" to the car, I am pretty sure the film will accumulate dirt around the edge and the outline will become visible on a light colored vehicle.  Also, if the film yellows from sun and weather (like headlight lenses for example), it will look terrible on a light colored car.Overall, albeit expensive, this is a good way to protect your car's door edge, if this is all you need."
78433,"this detailer is very easy to use and works well when you clay your car , it makes the clay slide easy and also cleans up quick so you can get to the waxing"
78434,"Received my order promptly and installed them in minutes. I have an F150 and the bed rails are raised up off the tops of the bed so I had to put some rubber strips under the rails to keep them from being pulled down when I tightened the anchors. Once the spacers were installed, the anchors look great and the rails are not sunken in.  My neighbor has the same truck and wants to order the same ones for his truck now."
78435,Restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color! Also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle. A great investment that'll last quite a long time.
78436,"Four--or is it five?--young libido cases who enjoy filming themselves committing various criminal acts are hired to break into a house where they discover an apparently dead body and a slew of old VHS tapes, each of which portrays acts that beat them at their own game. The important thing to remember is that each of the apparently unrelated, gory, disturbing, and largely supernatural episodes in the middle portions of ""V/H/S"" represents a separate VHS discovered by the characters at the beginning; i.e., this film utilizes the same ""frame-story"" (little stories within a larger story) technique that was first used by Boccaccio and Chaucer and that has been used in a host of works ever since.The sad thing is, the premise for ""V/H/S"" has real potential; unfortunately, it's largely ruined by the standard ""found footage"" cinematography. While I understand that the purpose of this is to add realism, ""V/H/S"" would be a much easier, less confusing view without the shaky camcorder that keeps zooming in on the floor or some drunken person's face. Another frustrating point is that the main ""envelope"" story is maddeningly incomplete. This film is honestly fascinating in places, but it requires a LOT of patience.Other Considerations:--Good dialogue, even though much of it's from characters who can't complete a sentence without at least one f-bomb and one ""dude!""--The various ""Special Features"" are worth a look. The commentaries reveal a great deal about what the creators were trying to do here.--You've probably guessed as much, but lots and lots of blatant gore and nudity, even more than in other ""found footage"" flicks."
78437,Got for use in my Camaro for the dirty stained carpets and seats. A must have for anyone who likes keeping everything in their car clean!
78438,"I didn't hate this one, don't get me wrong, it's still miles from being good, but the lead character has potential. Nice to see Malcolm McDowell and Bernadette Peters acting, and though I'm not a huge fan of Saffron Burrows, there was just enough of her without triggering the usual boredom sensation I get when she's on screen. Everyone else was meh, except the new conductor who was a one dimensional black hole of comedy. If this gets picked up, consider revising the character."
78439,"The Bosch blade was easy to install and it did a great job while driving in heavy rain and wind gusts condition. They are as good and effective after 10 days of use as they were on day one.Each blade comes with clear installation instructions right on the packaging and I believe that I had it all done in less than one minute which is something given that I'm a little rusty when it comes to replacing wiper blades. Depending on how long-lasting these are, I'm likely to get the same make and model for a replacement but only time will tell."
78440,"The Bay is a found-footage/documentary-style horror film. It follows a story of an epidemic in the Chesapeake Bay; it is told as a documentary and in narrated by a news reporter who originally covered the story; other characters' stories are also told including a doctor, a few cops, and a family visiting for the 4th of July festivities. It's a very well made film.The film's story is disturbing and creepy; although it's not exactly a disease in the movie (you'll find out what it truly is later in the film), the film effectively uses the disease/epidemic concept. Imagine being eaten from the inside by an unknown disease without any medial help or help from the government; it truly is terrifying, especially if you're afraid of disease or sickness. It has some very unique scares, including the theme and jump scares, and some generic found-footage scene, but it's balanced very well. The special effects were also great and shocking, fans of gorefests may enjoy it; we see faces being mutilated, body parts being amputated, etc. The acting was great most of the time, some of the acting was bad and slightly affected the authenticity of the film. It runs at a very fast pace, as well, which is good in my opinion. The ending was great and dark, as well. There aren't many significant flaws in this film.Overall, I really enjoyed The Bay; it's a well-made horror film that effectively uses its concept to frighten the audience. If you have completely given up on the found-footage style of shooting, then this film may revitalize your faith in the genre. People that are afraid of disease may be frightened the most. I highly recommend a rental.The Bay has very strong violence and gore. No sex or nudity."
78441,"This is a nice trap! Great for catching stray cats in our neighborhood, thanks. Easy to use, and easy to catch critters!"
78442,"Love fresh tomatoes.... Best flavor when you don't refrigerate them.  Of course, they come with those pesky fruit flies.  As do almost every other fresh fruit and vegetable summer delight.  But the Terro Fruit Fly trap works wonderfully.  It's small and east to use, since it only requires that you open the clever apple shaped container, and set it near your produce.  I have tried many home made ideas and solutions, but this works best.  Keeps the tiny varmints from taking over the kitchen.  Works for me!  This shall be a summer staple from now on."
78443,"Yes, this pedal is plastic, the switch is not the most durable feeling, and the knob placement is annoying.  At less than $15, you need to be able to look past these things.  I've had a higher failure rate with the Dunlop Cry Baby and that thing is built like a cinder block.  This pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended. Which is to say, this pedal does a nice job in overdriving the preamp tubes in your valve amplifier.  No brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going.  No overdrive pedal lives up to it's potential running into a solid state (even modeling) amplifier.  It's just not what they are really intended to do and they end up sounding buzzy. Some have complained about RF interference with the use of the FAB pedals (getting radio signals through your amp).  I have had that happen with pedals costing 5x the price of the FAB- particularly when running a long pedal chain.  Based on tone alone, this pedal can overdrive your tube preamp as well as most anything out there under $100.  Check out the YouTube review of this pedal by a guy that goes by 'intheblues'.  I believe he uses a DRRI with a strat, and this pedal sounds GREAT.  If you did a blind test between this pedal and an overdrive costing north of $100 you may be surprised- particularly if your other gear (amp and guitar) are halfway decent.  What I did note though, was that this pedal has a wee bit more gain and a little less treble than my other TS type pedals.  That doesn't make it worse or better- just different.  The 'mid-hump' is actually less pronounced than in a tubescreamer, which is a good thing IMHO.  There are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market!  It will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers.  Incidentally, the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes.  Since it isn't true bypass, you will likely get some tone suck if you run a bunch of these in your chain, but if the rest of your pedals have decent bypass you will be fine.  Lest you mistake me for a novice fanboy with no point of reference for my review- I've been playing guitar since 1979 and have used 'vintage' dirt boxes since before they were vintage and overpriced.  I am years past caring about the brand and all about getting good sounds from simple gear.  YMMV-"
78444,This happened to be a special when I made the purchase. I grabbed at the bargain and placed the order. Usually I read the reviews first but this had a time factor so I bought it before time ran out. After the purchase I read the reviews. I did not have the leakage problem that others experienced. The package arrived sooner than expected and the contents were perfect.This kit contains everything that I ever use for cleaning my vehicles. These are quality products and do an excellent job. Although I got these at a special price the regular price is not enough more to keep me from reordering when my current supply runs out. Good stuff.
78445,This is a show that my wife and I truly enjoy.  We'll watch episode after episode until we realize there are no more to watch.  My wife will then watch them over again.
78446,It's got all the bases covered in this family.  Great actors and interesting premise that would make a terrific show.
78447,Great way to straiten fins.Much more effective that sitting there with a ruler or scraper to sort out any dings.This set is nice as it has the common sizes (pitches) for both AC and automotive work.
78448,This series just keeps getting better.  The characters are evolving and every show keeps me guessing as to what the aliens really want.
78449,"While this series hasn't reached the level as its predecessor overall the series does grow in entertainment and quality per episode, especially as we get some screen time with some of the other background characters in the series as well.  While the Wraith remain the primary enemy on the series we also get some intrusion from past enemies as well from G'aould to the Replicators as well as some cameo time from some of the SG1 team members too.  While Shepard is no Jack O'Neill he has started getting his own personality it seems that fits the series well and while the super model leader Teyla still feels unneeded she has become somewhat less annoying in the series as well.  If you have the Stargate series I say for the price these sets are going for that it's a pretty good bargain to add the five seasons of Stargate Atlantis to the shelf as well...."
78450,"When I heard that MTV had plans to update the cheesy eighties movie ""Teen Wolf"" into a modern serialized drama, I can't say that I was filled with optimism. As the network was trying to establish a successful slate of scripted programming, however, a sexy and suspenseful werewolf thriller made sense. I just didn't know if MTV could get the right creative force to put the project together in an interesting way and utilize the budget and effects necessary to make it stand apart from the supernatural crowd. I think it's fair to say that this is more of a complete reinvention of the source film as opposed to any sort of remake. Aside from sharing an overlapping central theme, the two projects couldn't be more dissimilar. But utilizing the same sensibilities that have made ""Vampire Diaries"" a success, this wolf saga is an intoxicating blend of humor, romance, and chills. Starting as more of a frothy comedy, the series gradually incorporated darker elements as the narrative unfolded until you were sometimes surprised just how effective the thriller aspect was working.I used ""Vampire Diaries"" as a specific reference point, because I also think that ""Teen Wolf"" has all the qualities needed to become a break-out hit. It is a show that would certainly be appreciated by people that don't watch MTV. ""Vampire Diaries"" on CW had an uneven (but likable) first season, but turned into a surprisingly sophisticated soap opera for a stellar second season. ""Wolf,"" similarly, has the potential to evolve further into a smart and multi-layered entertainment. The twelve episodes of Season One, by necessity, focused on two major plot points--a boy who becomes a wolf and the search for his maker. In the show, Tyler Posey plays the central character. As he starts to understand what is happening, the scripts deftly blends comedy, confusion, and awe as he gets an unlikely tutor in the form of a more serious wolfman played by Tyler Hoechlin. The early episodes exhibit plenty of charm as Posey relishes his new school status and blossoming romance. As the show progresses, the sense of danger becomes a primary ingredient. I wasn't crazy about every aspect that helped bring the Alpha story line to fruition. The central mystery, when it was finally revealed, lacked a bit of surprise or impact for me. But it was a small point in an otherwise engaging season.While the entire cast is attractive and effective, I've got to throw out props to Posey. Of course, only in TV land would Posey be considered a loser. Adorable smile, killer physique, and all around charming demeanor--the show brands him a geek initially for the apparent reason that he is an asthmatic (inhalers are so unsexy). He juggles the complexities of his role with dexterity and is always a winning protagonist--it is easy to be invested in his plight and emotional journey. As his wacky sidekick, Dylan O'Brien also gets a special shout-out from me. Why? He portrays the biggest cliche' possible as Posey's wise-cracking best friend and still makes it seem effortless and new. I really enjoyed this show. Fast and stylish, with an appropriately impressive MTV soundtrack, this is sheer entertainment. It doesn't have lofty goals--it just wants to give you a fun ride. And that it does. KGHarris, 8/11."
78451,"One philosophy of good writing is to start with our protagonist a hundred feet underwater and work your way out from there. The one flaw in that notion is that you can leave the reader/viewer confused and disoriented. This is not always the best way to keep someone's interest.The Americans starts out like that. You don't what's happening, why, and for just a little while I felt like turning it off. But it soon settled down into it mirror-image of the old husband/wife spy team trope, and it works great. i'm looking forward to more of the same."
78452,Gabriel Macht is amazing in this series. And I've been a Gina Torres fan since her Firefly days. Stories are wonderful.
78453,I've been using these for over a year and have always been able to rely on them. They come with a thin layer of oil on them in order to prevent rusting (which causes them to lose precision). Keep them oiled with something like WD40 or a light mineral oil and you'll get a lifetime use out of them.
78454,"very nice guitar pics, sound almost as nice as metal guitar pics, very lovely, size was as expected, great sound"
78455,We purchased these as a replacement for 3 others that were looking tired after many years and washes.  They are exactly the same size as the originals.  They're easy to take apart and wash which is a must before you refill.  The price we paid also beat the large department store that also carries them.
78456,"I would recommend this mic for any application from home studios to a spare mic for any musician. They use a heavy metal casing that appears durable, and the cord is decent enough for live sound, but a very slight hum was present with my guitar/harp amp. I would pay this price for just the element! It is truly a great buy, and I would use it for armature work any day. I use it for harp (harmonica) and it works great, and it sounds smooth with vocals too. I would recommend it to any friend, and I already have... Worth every penny!"
78457,It's not that great. You go through batteries like crazy and it doesn't work at all for bass. It's fine for guitar or banjo
78458,"if you like this guage you'd like these.. I just tried them, just to try.. but I've confirmed I like heavier gauges."
78459,We love this show except Jay Paul and RJ are a little annoying catching the baby gators and thinking the are kings.Ready for season 4.
78460,Really enjoyed this series. One downer is that it seems to keep dragging on and on instead of new issues each season.  But still is very interesting.
78461,"This battery works! I purchased it for a Coleman camping lantern I got in 2006. Don't throw out those lanterns folks, just replace the battery and you'll be good to go another 6-8 years!"
78462,"After fighting with the deer and the rabbits for several years and trying to keep them away from our flowers and shrubberies, we tried a cheaper ""scarecrow"" type of sprinkler.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  It helped some but was very inconsistent.  We decided to step up our defense with the Orbit 62100 Yard Enforcer Motion Activated Sprinkler.  I am happy to report, so far so good!!!  All flowers and shrubberies (in range) are in tact.  I also love that multiple sprinklers can be connected.  We haven't used it as a pure ""sprinkler"" setup and am not sure if we ever will.  It just works too well as a critter deterent to mess with the success.  We currently have it in a location so that it isn't set off unknowingly by ayone such as mailman, ups delivery, etc., so we haven't used the timer function either.  It's nice to know it's available if we decide to move it or purchase additional units in the future to cover other more ""traveled"" parts of the yard in the future.  OH -- one more bonus is that my neighbor's cat no longer uses the flower bed as his litter box!!! Yahoo!!!!  He hasn't moved to an area in the yard yet that isn't covered by this sprinkler, so we're set until he figures that out.  Once he does, we will probably purchase another unit.  The one time I saw his reaction when he got drenched was totally priceless!!!  I just wish I had also set up a motion activated video camera for that!!!"
78463,Love the creative story line! Very entertaining. The only thing I don't like is that it can be a little gory.
78464,Not appropriate to watch. Guess I am naive but this should be rated 'R' for graphic scenes and language. Can't believe parents would say these kinds of things to their children. I do not recommend this to anyone.
78465,I rented this movie exam a fan of the leading man. I've always enjoyed his work. In this movie I didn't get involved and I don't think he got involved either. The movie was shot for lighting very little character development I did not seem to care about the story the characters or the cast.  I hope others find it more entertaining than I did!
78466,"We all know it's just a container with a sponge in it, no biggie. I bought it to get Super Saver shipping on something else and because I plan to keep an all-solid acoustic guitar at a weekend place where it will sit unused for long periods of time. Jamming it between the guitar strings and getting it hooked onto them feels a bit rough on the strings. But it should do the job."
78467,"so i truly enjoyed the first two seasons of Battlestar...truly awesome, military sci/fi show, insane sets, great plot, good acting and those Cylons. all great....the end of season two had some difficulties. alot ALOT less action and more crying. lots of crying. lots of drama. lots of forgetting the entire purpose of the show.season three is where ive ended my battlestar lust....i truly cant take Starbuck anymore, whiny brat...could care less about her romantic interests nor her false bravado.entire spisodes went by with nary a mention of the Cylons.....which, lets be honest...is the best thing about the show.it seems they lost focus or they changed course to appeal to the more 'dramatic' aspects while shelving the 'sci/fi' alltogether.terrible mistake.... i fear season three is when i say frack off Battlestar....you had a AMAZING thing going."
78468,"While not as many episodes for this season, it's just like the other seasons where surprisingly he has places to still explore...both for food and other various topics (politics, self reflection, culture).  Recommended."
78469,I setup my RV so it was level side to side and front to back.  I then installed these so I could see then from the electric jack on the front of my RV.  I first would get the left to right correct with drive on leggo block wheel lift and chocks and then work the electric jack to get the front to back.  No more fooling around with going inside the RV and checking with a level any more.  I epoxied mine in place after they had set over night and had not changed before doing so.  I used JB 10 minute epoxy to do this.
78470,Simple and well made.......Very happy ....pops open and zero time to put together...metal and sturdy...squirrels can and will sit on the edge...but so far unlike other bird feeders this one is still hanging and not on the ground!~
78471,Bought this for a gift and my dad loved it. works well and easy to understand and can eliminate check engine light rather quickly
78472,"This hose winder is very compact and easy to install.  When you switch the lever to wind mode, it does use the water pressure to self-wind the hose.  The water that ""leaks"" out of its discharge hose is actually the water that is needed to wind it.  I simply let that small hose drain into the plants, so it's not an issue.The problem, as some people have mentioned here, is the winding track doesn't always line up the way it's supposed to, so you have to guide it along in the ""box"" as it's winding.  If the winding hose is extremely long, it can get frustrating to someone who has little patience.  Also note: From experience, if the hose you are using has a rubbery outside, it can get really stuck, so I do not recommend that type of hose for this product.  Other than the track issue which is a learning process to deal with, I have not had any other issues with mine, and it functions well even after 2 years.  I do believe that the benefit here outweighs the little snags.  Make sure you pull the hose straight out first, then take it where you need to; and on the way back in, it does the work - you just need to guide it a little."
78473,I'm not someone who would usually watch a musical at all.. But this show has me hooked. I'm hoping for many season too come.
78474,I loved everything about this show. I was laughing the whole way through and I wanted to watch more. Awesome cast and it was well written. This was one of the few that I watched more than once.
78475,Claymation is wonderful and this is better than a cartoon.  All Shaun the Sheeps are well done with great stories for the PG crowd!
78476,I have this on top of my Dyno-Glo gas grill great cover very well made and will last me a few years.  My weber plastic ones seems it will last me two years at best.  This one at least 3-5.
78477,"This story is a bit slow, but the acting is worth the watch, and the costumes are interesting, glad we women don't have to wear those bonnets these days!!"
78478,Works great to pull someone out of the sand at Pismo (Oceano Dunes) Beach makes it quick and simple to get people unstuck from the sand or even yourself if the need be. So far it has worked every time and the tow driver out on the beach doesn't like me pulling people out for free. another item got here fast and is great thing to have in your truck for emergency
78479,"Love the show, characters, music, story, art, everything. This is one of the most entertaining cartoons out today. Pen Ward is a genius."
78480,"I never turn down a chance to see a post-apocalyptic sci-fi adventure film. However, I become a bit more leery whenever I learn that the film is based on a video or role playing game. Very few cinematic adaptations have done justice to the source. Off the top of my head, the cream of the crop number the LARA CROFT and RESIDENT EVIL series. DOOM, MORTAL KOMBAT, and SILENT HILL tend to fall under the umbrella of so-so adaptations. And then you've got bottom of the barrel picks like MAX PAYNE, ALONE IN THE DARK, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, STREET FIGHTER, BLOODRAYNE, etc.And then there's MUTANT CHRONICLES, a doom and gloom Indie sci-fi film co-starring Thomas Jane, Ron Perlman, and an apathetic John Malkovich. The cool premise, intense worldbuilding and internal mythology, and brutal violence induce me to give it a thumbs up. The poor execution, the monotone delivery of dialogue (shout out to Malkovich!), the laughable attempts at character development, and the sheer oppressive tediousness of the thing reluctantly convince me to give it the finger.At the end of the Ice Age the Machine came from outer space with the sole purpose of converting mankind into mutants. After much struggle and bloodshed a massive seal was placed on the Machine, and for thousands of years it lay dormant. In the distant future, in the 28th Century, four warring mega-corporations hold dominion over a ravaged planet. But one brutal skirmish in the trenches between two corporations cracks open the great seal and soon ghoulish mutants erupt from the bowels of the earth and very quickly overrun civilization, forcing the remnants of humanity to flee to otherplanetary colonies - providing they come up with the rare transport ticket. A grizzled warrior monk from an ancient brotherhood gathers an elite team of soldiers and descends underground with the intent of putting an end to the infernal Machine once and for all. They bring with them a tome of prophesy and an ancient device which they think is a bomb. It's not a bomb.The film is relentless with its violence and gore, even though the crack troop pretty much frags over and over the same six actors who, rumor has it, portrayed the hordes of mutants. It helps that these lobster pincered freaks lack individuality and look the same. But the fight scenes are pretty cool, and I wish the silent monk warrior girl had more chances to swing that sword of hers. She's the assigned protector of the Book of Chronicles. And, no, she doesn't know how to read the thing, but she sure protects the shizzy out of it!But the movie collapses under the weight of its taking itself too seriously, at being too solemn, and it doesn't get much support from a story that is lacking, cinematography that is depressingly gritty and monochromatic, and actors who turn in B-movie performances. All the religious babblepalooza doesn't help, either.Ron Perlman is decent as the warrior monk Brother Samuel, but he doesn't bring his best stuff. Thomas Jane who plays the tough-as-nails Sgt. John Mitchell Hunter seems to be positioning himself as the next Christopher Lambert. The rest of the cast aren't developed enough. There's a listless cameo from John Malkovich who I guess just couldn't be bothered. He drones out lame lines like ""The absence of gravity interferes with my digestion."" Man, what's happened to you, John Malkovich? You used to bring it, even if you were always on the quirky side.As mentioned, the look of the film may be gritty and monochromatic, but, on second thought, it really doesn't bug me that much. Overall, I have no problems with the special effects. A comment from the DVD's special features informs us that the CG work was heavily bolstered by old school f/x techniques (matte paintings, make-up, and miniatures, etc.). The film imagines a grimy steampunk sort of technology, and it's kind of neat that the machines in this world rely heavily on coal power.I missed this during its theatrical release, but I had hopes, so I got the 2 disc set, in which lurks an abundance of bonus features. Disc 1 offers the widescreen presentation, as well as audio commentary by Ron Perlman and Director Simon Hunter. Disc 2 has the following: the extensive Making Of documentary (107:25 minutes); six deleted scenes, all of which if inserted would've dragged the pace even more (7:49 minutes); Green Screen & Storyboard Comparisons for three scenes (13:57 minutes); the promotional teaser short film with optional Director's commentary (7:15 minutes); the Making Of the promotional teaser short film (3:26 minutes); a heck of a lot of short interviews with the cast & crew; HDNet: A Look at MUTANT CHRONICLES - a look at the world and characters of MUTANT CHRONICLES (4:40); 94 slides of Storyboard art; Concept Art (50 illustrations); Visual Effects (2:48); MUTANT CHRONICLES Panel Q&A; from the 2009 San Diego ComicCon, the end of which has Ron Perlman thinking that the crowd was laughing at him but, really, the chuckles were for Thomas Jane who just couldn't stop slamming down glass after glass of water (11:35); 12 brief webisodes mostly exploring the characters in the film; and the trailer to the thing.As at least one other reviewer had mentioned, the first half-hour or so crawls like a mother. But it picks up once the suicide mission team is assembled. I'm almost tempted to recommend this movie because it has its share of cool elements. But ultimately the downside tilted the balance to the other direction. So, 2.5 out of 5 stars for MUTANT CHRONICLES. Not quite worth purchasing, but it makes for a nice rental or cable viewing. But hope springs eternal. Maybe the upcoming live action flick PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME can do its gaming origin proud."
78481,Great for the beginner!
78482,I have a black Lexus and the shine is great. I only use Meguiar product on my cars and never have been disappointed  Another great Meguiar product.
78483,"These work great. Ordering on Amazon sure beats a trip to the auto parts store. If you want to be sure you're ordering the proper size, visit the Bosch website. They have sizing for all vehicles. Check your size over there, then come back to Amazon and order. I replaced my old Rainx wipers, and I got to say so far I like these better. No idea how long they will last, but they do seem to perform better."
78484,"A solid, easy to install, lock box.  Don't be fooled, easy to install with the right tools, and the bad guys won't be able to just snatch it out or pop the door open.  It's nice and easy to use and seems like it'll last."
78485,"These are good size medium chunks and my husband using them for our smoker.  They worked and the smell was nice.  They seem to be over priced, we found similar wood at a local store and they were much cheaper and seem to do just as good of job.  Great for ease of delivery, but shop around to see what you can find at home first."
78486,Hannibal is great not because of Hannibal himself but because of Will Graham.  Will is delightfully arcane and peculiar as he searches for the killer.  His morality is absolute.  He will kill the killer if that is what it takes.  I love this show.
78487,"Subtitles in english only. A plus in picture. Boring in the middle of the movie. Slow, slow, slow..."
78488,"This holds up really well, an doesn't kink.It is not drinking water safe, and has a very strong plastic smell when first used. It does the job I intended it to do."
78489,"As a family of antique dealers, I love this program.  It not only shows some great old things ( and a good variety of them too), but you get a smattering of history as well.  Lots of fun with just enough banter to break it up and enough interesting types of restorations to keep you coming back for more.  Thanks for a &#34;reality show&#34; that isn't drivel."
78490,"Got refurbished from Country Butler and it is GREAT. I have two of these, one for home and one for work. Both work great, have no issues, and use the same batteries as all of our other Black and Decker 20V items (weed eater, hedge trimmer)."
78491,"I must have six or eight of these small hoses.  I always find a use for them!  When they are on sale, I purchase several to keep them on hand."
78492,"love the concept of teachers who regret that they are no longer students in their own eras. The school secretary was brilliant. The loony, nearly dead older teacher permanently in the teacher's lounge is sad but funny. The alcoholic older slacker teacher who roots for the younger slacker teachers is inspired."
78493,Because I love the show along with the characters Brandy being sexy and smart and Jerod the witty one of course Caintleave My man Barry out with all his poker faces and Darrel &brandon the bad asses they are I could do without Dave being the ass he is
78494,"To begin with, we have and use a very large number of feeders and have for years.  We have a very large number of different feeders which have been collected from here and there over the years.  We have been using this particular feeder in our arsenal for about six years now - as a matter of fact at present we have five or six of them in active use.Like most things we purchase and use in life, there are good things and bad things about this particular feeder.  Nothing is perfect and nothing is absolutely bad and useless.  Most hummingbird feeders fall into the middle and probably one of the biggest problems with this feeder and other feeder is simply expectations.  Some folks set the bar very, very high, while others more or less are willing to take the bad a long with the good.  We personally fall into this category.Now let's start with the positive:First and foremost, and I feel the most important, is that these feeders do attract hummingbirds and the little guys seem to like them. During peek season we actually have trouble keeping all of our feeders filled on a daily basis, ergo, we rotate the filling and cleaning session.Second, these feeders are extremely economical.  To maintain and use as many feeders as we have would be a major financial strain if we used only the high end feeders exclusively.  We have quite a number of these too, but hey there is only so much money in our household to devote to this one project.Third, the four perches provided are a welcome addition and I feel is one of the big attractions causing high usage.Forth, these feeders contain only 8 oz of nectar solution.  This ""forces"" me to continually check them and since we maintain so man feeders there is less likely hood of my getting ""lazy"" and not changing the unused (a rare occurrence) as often as I should.  There is less likelihood of cloudy and contaminated nectar.fifth, these are easy to hang in various locations and in winder they are quite easy to store and do not take up all that much storage space.Sixth, these are plastic and if you drop one, something that I frequently do, they will not shatter.  It is discouraging to drop a 20 or 30 dollar feeder and spend an hour making sure you get all the shatter glass cleaned up to say nothing of the loss of money.Now the bottom side:First, these are not ""forever"" feeders like most of the glass feeders we use.  They will over time, depending upon how much sun they get per day, deteriorate, become brittle and break.  We personally get from two to three years use out of each feeder but at that is an acceptable cost for us.Second, yes, these things are just a bit more of a pain to clean than some of our other feeders.  We do need to use special little brushes and to do the job right, they must be completely disassembled.  This is not a great burden though and truth be told, I kind of enjoy the process and it gives me a chance to check everything out to make sure all is well.Third, the bee guard is not 100 percent effective.  Small bees can and do get into the feeders and the guards are completely useless as to the ants we have here.  On the other hand I find that a coating of Vaseline to the wire holding the feeder pretty well stops the ant problem and since these things are being constantly cleaned and refilled the few bees that do get in, while unsightly, are not that great a problem.All in all, for us, the positives far outweigh the negative.  Is this the only feeder we use?  No, most certainly not.  I took a look the other day and we have about 10 different feeders in use at this time.  By the end of the summer we will have more when the birds become more active.  Is this be very, very best feeder we have?  No, but they price wise and effective wise they serve their purpose quite well.We are quite satisfied with this feeder and will continue using them as long as they are available.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"
78495,"This is magical. I only use 15mL in a 1L pressure spray bottle for my whole car. This bottle is going to last me a life time. Left my BRZ shiny and glossy. Got rid of all the dirt, grime, bird poop, and dust. I do an initial spray of the whole car, let it drip off most of the dirt, then focus wash the rest of my car in sections."
78496,It does know when your guitar is in tune! Does it for you so you don't have to do it by ear.
78497,I have no complaints that I can think of. I reserved 1 star because it wasn't anything particularly special about it. I liked that I got it free shipping 2 days and Amazon validated that it is the right one for my car.
78498,"This is my second booster pack, they sell another one not as powerful but for roughly $25, you get a stronger one.First off, for the negative reviews, I would ignore them.  It plainly says on the box to fully charge it soon as you buy the product and then to fully charge it again at least once every three months.This thing has saved me from trouble many times.  We have one vehicle that has a persistent dead battery, this thing literally boosted the big V8 mercedes from being completely dead to starting IMMEDIATELY.  Even with jumper cables its a few minutes wait and a tough time starting, not with this thing.  And to top it off, used it daily for 3 weeks and it worked every time ON A SINGLE CHARGE!!This is the same product you will see your mechanic shop using, your body shop, your road side assistance guy, the junk yard, basically everywhere, because its SMALL so it fits in any car.  Good clamps.I highly suggest buying one especially over jumper cables.  A good set of jumper cables will cost you $50, but spend the extra and you don't have to worry about finding another car and going through all the trouble aligning the cars properly.Plus, you can leave this thing plugged in and not worry about it over charging and ruining anything."
78499,Got this to replace the old chalky cracked one on my camper. It replaced it fine. I did have to replace the plug so the it would fit inside the hatch. The little sliding door is nice so you can close the big door when the cord is out.
78500,They work surprisingly well. I honestly had no idea just how much these would stabilize our RV and I'm very glad I was talked into getting them
78501,It's run it's course and needs to end.  I only gave it 3 stars because the performances are good... the storyline is just dull.
78502,Rich production values add texture and interest to this story about Viking conquests and the plotting &  politics that spearheaded changes. Love the men's hair.
78503,"With all the electronics that are on all the time in modern cars, this is a necessity to keep the batteries charged. Use this for my BMW 850 that uses two batteries, and to avoid the consequences of dead batteries, which are bad, I use this when I park the car. As a result, I have never suffered a dead battery, even after a long parked period. Works just as well to recharge the battery on an older car, '83 Volvo, that doesn't deplete its own battery."
78504,"Anybody who has seen &#34;Heroes&#34; will immediately know the basic outlines of this show. It's about a group of humans with superpowers who fight criminals, but with an attempt to make the superheroes more realistic rather than like comic book characters.The show is entertaining. It never really rises to greatness though. Three things held it back. First, it seems too familiar, almost like a &#34;Heroes Lite.&#34; There's nothing that really makes the show stick out, except perhaps David Strathairn, who defies the stereotypes as an elderly, kindly leader who lacks superpowers.Second, the show never seemed like it was going anywhere. Like a modern serials, which seem obsessed with continuity, the show keeps dropping hints about a bigger mystery but seldom provides resolution. Some villains disappear from the picture without use even knowing who they were or why they were such a threat. We do get some character development, especially with the female characters, but the male characters seem stuck in place. Some characters seem to just pop up once or twice but don't seem to really drive anything further.Finally, the ensemble doesn't fully work. There are a lot of things I like about the characters. They seem much more real and grounded than most TV sci-fi characters. Also, I'm glad they didn't choose a bunch of supermodels for all of the roles (the actors are attractive but not supermodels). Individually, the characters work pretty well.Unfortunately, collectively it seems like there are cliques, as if they don't all work as a team. The show seemed to have trouble finding good situations for the male and female characters to work together. Some pairings worked (like Bill and Gary), but rather than following a team I almost felt like I was watching several small groups with a loose connection to each other.Overall, I'd recommend the show for fans of dramatic sci-fi (or if you loved &#34;Heroes&#34;), but go in with realistic expectations."
78505,Great show for preschoolers.  My grandchildren love it! Emphasizes friendship and helping friends and those in need.  Focuses on math skills including patterns and measurement.
78506,"Forget what you saw in the Green Lantern movie!  This cartoon is true to it's comic book origins.  The CGI is perfect for this intergalactic cartoon.  The Green Lantern Corps is perfectly portrayed in this animation breakthrough. Think Incredibles style animation and quality on a weekly basis. That's how good this cartoon is!  This one is worth the price of admission.  If you like the comic book genre and a well written and acted cartoon, this one is a keeper!  Attention is paid to the character development and villains that are worthy adversaries to the hero.  This one doesn't try to dumb down the characters for a young audience. Adults and kids will watch this again and again!"
78507,"I ordered this for my Jackson DKMG. This is my 1st Gator case, and I'm very pleased with it. It is similar to SKB and fits my guitar very nicely. Being lightweight is a big plus as well, and also the secure feeling of having a HSC. I will definitely buy this again for other guitars and highly recommend it. Just remember that this model is for standard type axes; Strats, Teles and such."
78508,"I installed this on my Audi I keep at a vacation house that only gets driven once a month.  It comes with two battery mounts - clips and a permanant set.  The permanant set installed quickly and easily on the battery - and there is a heavy duty plug witht a cover that I just tuck into the battery holder.  It all looks very clean and ""factory installed"".  When I leave town I just open the hood an inch - pull out the plug - and plug into the wall unit.  A red light indicates it is charging - green light means it is full.  All very simply and easy to use - and I never have the hassle of jumping the car or having to use another trickle charger."
78509,A series about health group lets flu epedmic out and everyones dies except for ages..  I recommend it for ages 18 and up.
78510,"I think I have large hands for a woman but it takes two hands for me to make these pruners work correctly.  I do like the ergonomic aspect and the rolling handle that turns as you squeeze the handles together but it takes two hands for me to do that.8-21-13:  I came back and changed my 5-star rating to a 2-star because yesterday I picked up these shears and walked up the driveway and clipped some Sweet Autumn Clematis to bring that wonderful fragrance into the house.  However, I also clipped and really pinched my right index finger and I was trying to use these pruners with one hand.  They are just too large for me.  I think the swiveling handle is the culprit.  I tried to give them to one of my visiting left-handed brothers and he said no thanks.  They are good and sharp and all but brand new but just too big unless I can use both hands."
78511,"Love, lust, betrayal, egocentric King....good times. This what the Tudors were all about. You know what they say, absolute power absolutly corpus"
78512,"To those not familiar with the character, Solomon Kane was one of the fictional creations of Texas writer Robert E Howard of the early 20th century.  Specializing in sword and sorcery, the stories and ensuing comic books have now been brought to life in a full-length feature film starring some smaller name Hollywood stars.  Though the original stories occurred throughout the world, this movie takes place firmly in Europe at the height of the Age of Discovery.  The movie begins with prologue describing the evil ways of Kane, and how he came to redemption.  The meat of the movie shows Kane wandering Europe avoiding sin until it finally catches up with him in the form of an evil army which he must defeat.  At its root is a fallen brother who works for the devil (don't they always).  And so we have the climactic battle between good and evil where Kane somehow vanquishes the devil with hardly a scratch to his body or soul.As a movie the acting is enough to carry the plot forward.  The dialogue is good, nothing cheesy or hokey.  The cinematography was good when it was not dark and shadowy.  As to the fight scenes; lets just say they were fast, furious, bloody, and often times ridiculous as we see one man slay hundreds in his way.  But then again the latter is a common fault in just about all sword and sorcery films.  There is little comedy, and minimal romance, just blustery action with some suspense if you suspend disbelief for a while.  Overall, an average action flick from Hollywood."
78513,"I didn't finish watching this episode. I barely started watching it, and it was just the second episode I was trying to watch. Something distracted me from it."
78514,"I thought this sounded like a handy item to have in my car for emergencies, so when the Amazon Vine program offered it for review, I ordered it.  First of all, it's cheap plastic and made in China.  That alone will usually put me off of buying an item I see in a store.I inserted the included batteries and turned it on.  It emits a red light that can either blink or remain static.  I thought the light seemed small and feeble, but I waited until nighttime to give it a real test.  I set it on my car with the magnetic end holding it to the hood and walked down the driveway to see it from a distance.  Although the red light was visible, it wasn't nearly bright enough to be used as a flare in a roadside emergency.  It wasn't even as bright or eyecatching as the lights you see on bicycle riders at night.I would never rely on this product to warn oncoming cars of a breakdown.  Nobody would know what it was even if they saw it in time to react.  I'm sticking with real flares, which are visible from far away and instantly tell other drivers of an accident or hazard ahead.I hope nobody decides to use this product as a ""safety flare"" in their cars!  I won't even keep it in my car as a ""map light"" as they suggest on the package.  I'll rely on the small mag light I already have in the car."
78515,"This is a great product, dealing with the stab jacks is no longer a sweaty affair.  But it takes a lot of juice out of the cordless drill to it.  This is because my drill batteries are old and no longer hold their charge well.  But I absolutely recommend getting this unit and packing along your cordless drill to make setting up camp that much easier.  My FIL was jealous of this thing when we camped this summer!"
78516,The only flaw is the rubber gaskets in the joints These deteriorate over 3 or 4 years. I go through these quite a bot but for $20-$30 you can't go wrong. Tubes are tough and sturdy
78517,"Action works well enough, but the blades only cut if you use the very tips.  I expected better from Fiskars because I have several other Fiskars hand tools."
78518,"Does what it says it will do, and it's well built for the relatively low-load job.  Not much else to say about it."
78519,"I haven't had this long enough to know if it's going to add life to my ride on mowers' battery life or not.  However, since I've hooked it up, the mower seems to be turning over better then it used to when it had sat for a few weeks.  So it seems the trickle charge is keeping the battery topped up.  This unit is weather resistant, but not weather proof.  I mounted it flat on the side of my shed, under an eave.  It gets great Sun all day, and is out of the rain, unless it's raining sideways (which happens here.)"
78520,"The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers. It's cheap and easy to use. It'll do the job, but I don't like it."
78521,"It's no wonder Russel and his wife divorced.  ""I wanted the diamond necklace to be a big deal and it was overshadowed by Russel's dog.""  Wasn't the birthday supposed to be about your daughter?  Russel got his daughter something that really mattered, not a damned necklace that she would forget in a day!  Wow, if I were married to any one of those women, I would have kicked them to the curb long ago."
78522,"Director/documentarian Werner Herzog assembles a small film crew to explore a recently discovered cave in southern France.  The cave is unique in that large, ornate wall art was found dating back more than 30,000 years.  Twice as old as any others found.  The government only allows scientists of various stripes into the cave and for relatively brief periods.  There are several arrays of drawings, but it doesn't take 90 minutes to see them, so Herzog adds some interesting interviews with archeologists, art historians and the like.  One of the young Frenchman is particularly interesting, especially telling one story of how Australian Aborigines felt about cave art.A beautiful musical score is layered across the film which certainly adds a reverent quality.  In fact, the score was recorded in an ancient church.  There is a ""special feature"" that documents all this on the Blu ray disc.  Ultimately, I was left with a lot of unanswered questions.  What material was used to produce the paintings?  Why are only animals depicted?  Why are there no trees, mountains...or people? This disc is in 3-D but I only viewed it in the 2-D format and the transfer is just fine, especially given the low light conditions inside the cave.  I understand the 3-D version shown in theaters is spectacular."
78523,"This is probably the most scripted &#34;reality&#34; show I've watched on the net.  The &#34;good ol' back woods swamp boys&#34; are about as authentic as a woman who has had implants and other plastic surgery, and has enrolled in a natural beauty contest."
78524,"Decent cast, but it seems a little formulaic.  Actors playing roles in their comfort range.  Plot line was a little too predictable."
78525,"Have tried several different wipe-style cleaners and find that this Armor All product does as good a job of cleaning my GT's interior as any of the products tried -- and some of the other products cost a lot more!These make cleaning fast and easy and they seem to give the car that 'new car' clean fragrance. In just a few minutes the steering wheel, instrument panel, center console, door panel, back speaker deck, glove box and other plastic, chrome and vinyl interior component turn from dusty to sparkling clean. Using these wipes beats spraying on a cleaner and then trying to wipe it off with a cloth... I go through four or five wipes each time, so the canister should supply enough for five or six cleanings.The reason for four stars -- the quality control of the wipes' canister is just not good, as we have had brand new packages opened dry, others drying out within a short period of time, and then others staying nice and damp all the way until the last wipe was used. Since we like the wipes but no longer trust the canister, we dump the contents (wipes and fluid) into a large zip-loc bag for safekeeping. That works well, but we really should not have to do this... so, four stars instead of five.Other Armor All products that we really like are the tire foam (Armor All Tire Foam Protectant 20 oz (1 lb 4 oz) 567 g) which produces a rich looking satin finish, the leather wipes (ArmorAll Leather Wipes Canister, 20 Wipes - Cleans, Conditions and Protects) which are great on my GT's leather seats, and the protectant (Armor All 10228 Original Protectant - 28 oz.) is excellent on the dash and all interior and exterior rubber.Highly recommend this product if you have a similar need... but think about keeping them in a zip-loc bag or something with a good seal."
78526,The product does exactly what it is designed to do...it seals fully around roof vents and other problems for our motorhome.  Easy to apply
78527,This look behind the scenes of classical music was fun and possibly believable.  The actors were great and made for some remarkable performances.
78528,"Battle fatigue has set in. Storyline good but not up to standards of previous seasons. Still, much better tie up than other jj Abrams series. Superb acting. Won't miss fringe story but will surely miss the characters"
78529,"I marathon watch all the seasons as they come. He's just normal and awesome and super honest, covering real human interactions, neurosis, insecurities, etc and he's sort of a modern philosopher in an every man package. Sometimes, I'm laughing and other times I'm just relating, but overall I find his show enjoyable."
78530,"We use 3 different battery tenders on our ATV's and mobility chair. None are in the same place, and we need the option of different length cords so we can park them where we want and no right next to an electrical outlet. Even with the extension cords these have performed flawlessly--one of them for over 3 years now. We used to go through ATV batteries about every 2 years--by keeping the batteries charged with these devices, they are lasting at least 4 years so far (keeping our fingers crossed).  These things are running 24/7 and we've never had a problem."
78531,Fits my electric jack so well. No worries about the winter months now. Really a very handy item to own.
78532,I bought this to go withValley 74080 Class III Receiver Hitch. I use the hitch to pull a boat and to pull a trailer. The hitch is well made and so far it has held up to a lot of abuse. The chrome on the ball mount has also held up pretty well; it hasn't started cracking or rusting. Great value product gets 5 stars.
78533,"This is a fantastic product that is well made. The plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use. This ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition.The tool is extremely useful. I have just started playing with a band, and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in. With the wheel, I immediately know what chords to choose from. I also know what notes are in each chord. In addition, it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing.The wheel is also invaluable for switching keys. For example, say you're playing the I, IV, and V chords in the key of C., but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in Bb. All you need to do is dial the wheel to Bb, find out the new I, IV, and V chords, and start playing. The wheel makes chord transposition a breeze.I feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair. This is a very useful product at a fair price.No, I am not affiliated with the company at all. I'm just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool.In my opinion, this is a five star product."
78534,"Let's scream and bicker and cuss and we can do another 100 more seasons . Loved the show from it's inception, but seasons kept getting more annoying as the writing was scrapped for hollering and shouting. They used to have clever endings and twists, like Seinfeld, but now Charlie or Dee seem to ruin whatever the story point was by acting uber-crazy in the end and scrwewing up the plot, that's a cop out. Come up with better ways to finish an episode gang. Perhaps 10 year olds will appreciate it?"
78535,"Have you ever driven through the state of Louisiana at night?  If you have you know all about thousands of bug splats on the front of your vehicle.  They can be really hard to remove......enter Griot's Garage 10982 Bug and Smudge!  This stuff really works, not perfectly, but good.  Spray it on and let it sit at least 30 seconds and then wipe!  Most of the bugs will be removed after wiping.  It works better than another bug remover product we have used before.  We have never used Griot's Garage products before but will now give them a look."
78536,"A well done show. entertaining, superbly written, engrossing, well developed characters, and a lot of fun. would watch it again"
78537,"I was really impressed with the script when I read it last year.  Super creative, quirky and affecting.  The production, however, doesn't quite rise to the level of the script.  The show could use more energy--and yes, I get that it's the tail end of a heatwave and everyone's worn out, but still, the whole episode felt somewhat lethargic.  The show could also use more visual flare.Nonetheless, there storytelling, acting and directing here are light years above and beyond the pathetic and mean-spirited crap that Disney cranks out.This show has soul and charm to spare.  Hope Amazon green-lights it to series. Highly promising and intriguing."
78538,I started playing and writing a few songs that were specifically designed to get the sound that comes from a capo higher on the neck.I found that I needed to have a couple of exta capos hanging around and so bought this and the G7th. Both are very good. I did notice that if I had a wider neck (I think i am 42.5 mm at the nut on my two Takamines) the may be a bit short. They work and are cool looking. I have aa adjustable Planet Waves that also works great. Cheaper ones also work
78539,"There's a lot of room for an interesting show here, but they've spoiled it by introducing a ridiculous amount of crime in the small town that has inexplicably been covered by a dome.  In the first two episodes (all I watched), the dome issue itself is merely background for murder and kidnapping and a few gross images of the dome cutting a cow and other living things in half."
78540,"I was going through a difficult time, and went through the seasons of this series one after another. Oddly, it kept me sane.Eric McCormack is perfect in the lead role - intelligent and vulnerable."
78541,"Have had it for 2 seasons. The only complaint, which most yell about is the battery longevity. Taking the fact it takes 8 hours or so to recharge and they last about 15 minutes takes away one star to a 4.But I do like the fact the battery works on many other B&D; products, which is a plus."
78542,"I had no idea what to expect, considering the description given. I would/will add this to my watch list for sure. I enjoy movies like this i.e., ""Signs"", War of the Worlds""...going way back to add ""Close Encounters"". I sure do hope they continue with this. I'm also excited to see Amazon doing originals/exclusives like Netflix has been doing. I have a better watching experience with Amazon. Now, I'm going to check out the other Amazon Originals that I just discovered...Oh, I would never had known that was Jamie Kennedy as the Clown! Awesome!"
78543,"This show is a new and innovative approach to learning history.  Drunk teachers.  Too bad most high school history classes were not this much fun.  When it is funny, it very funny.  When it gets boring, it makes you change the channel.  There are a lot of talented comedians involved here, so get ready for the funny.  Give it a chance.  And NEVER believe what you hear."
78544,"First let me preface by saying I've followed Doctor Who through most of it's lifetime, never got that excited about it.Then there was the whole Russel Davies resurrection of it and I was hooked.  It jumped the shark a lot over the seasons, many omg what were they thinking moments, but if you twisted your ""head"" just right, it was a pretty enjoyable experience and I've watched seasons 1-6 multiple times and not regretted the price of admittance (Amazon for a lot of it).Season 6, enjoyed it, though was getting a might tired with the ""and then there was a paradox... and everyone lived happily ever after"".  Moffat, I've loved his stuff, Hyde and Sherlock being two series well worth watching.  Though admittedly several years later I still puzzle over Hyde.That said...  This season for whatever reason they're doing ""small stories"", that winds up being pretty boring and predictable.  They're getting rid of Amy and Rory (that's happened in an episode that's aired already so not viewing that as being a spoiler of any sort), and they wind up spending way too long with everyone giving each other long sad looks.... Boring.In this specific episode, plot was predictable, their work on having the Doctor being at a ""darker"" place since he's been wandering around without companions a lot doesn't work all that well.  The cyborg in the episode, well, I think I could come up with something better looking.Alien ship lands in the old west in the USCyborg looking for the doctordoctor and companions show upI'm being kind by giving it two stars and no have no desire to see the episode again, just not that much fun."
78545,"This hose reel is both pretty and convenient.  I like that it hangs on the wall rather than sitting on the ground because it is less in the way (I don't have a deck to worry about).  And the rotating feature will let me move my hose around to different parts of my yard so much more easily.The back brackets are just over 10 inches long so they fit perfectly and lie flat on my 1950s cedar shakes.  If you have smaller siding, you might have more trouble getting it to sit right on the siding.  (The installation instructions contemplate a flat wall.) The reel pieces go on after you fasten the bracket piece so you don't have to hold the whole thing while you fasten it to the wall.Speaking of fastening, this product does not come with the screws necessary to mount it on your wall.  So it would be a good idea to go out and get the screws while you wait for this to arrive.  The manufacturer recommends (4) 7 or 8 mm lag screws with washers (5/16"" x 2 1/2"") for a flat wood frame wall.  For a brick masonry wall they suggest (4) 7 or 8 mm x 60 mm masonry wall anchors, (4) anchor sleeves, (4) washers, (4) lock washers, and (4) nuts.I am slightly concerned about how this metal hose reel will hold up in Minnesota weather.  However, the manufacturer suggests the hose reel part be taken off and stored indoors or sealed in a plastic container over the winter.  That just leaves the bracket to worry about."
78546,"Trustable, quiet, good materials, durable, etc... Maybe these are not the best when its about helping with the space on the pedalB bcuz of their large plug'heads', but they do a perfect job with my guitar signal...and honestly, for me, that's what I need... Good stuff to have!"
78547,"This is a great tool.  Due to arthritis, I could never get the drain plug insertedcorrectly so it leaked profusely.  This enabled me to insert the plug(a replacementmetal one)with no leaks!"
78548,"Unlikely plot, single lonely astronaut. Looks pretty, makes no sense."
78549,love the show. wish it was still on but love being able to watch anytime I want too love it
78550,"Sheep, stupid, but humans, dumber.  So goes the premise of Shaun the sheep.  The farmer and his dog act like prison  guards oblivious to dangers that Shaun and the flock overcome."
78551,I bought this to replace the broken plastic door holder on my 5th wheel.  The original holes lined up perfectly with the new metal holder.  Seems to be well made and should last a long time.
78552,"I like the idea, but when it is saturated with water and soap, it gets heavy to a point where the insides pop out.  Hard to explain, but I won't be buying this one again as a wash mit....maybe a buffer or something on glass."
78553,"She watches it on TV when it is on, and now can be occupied on my Kindle Fire whenever I am watching something else on TV."
78554,My 3 yr old loves this show! It is both entertaining and educational. The variety of animals that they teach about is great.
78555,"The only thing that I thought could develop over time was the one teacher's romantic interest. Was there anything else?In any case; it was still amusing to watch, but definitely not my top choice."
78556,"My mother in law needed more light in the walkway leading to her garage.  With the interior walls already insulated & finished out, it would have been a major undertaking to wire in a 110 volt security light.  This Maxsa light was just the ticket.  While not bright enough to light up the whole yard, it is perfectly adequate for its intended use.  During daylight & even dusk hours, it doesn't seem all that bright, but at night, it lights up her walkway up to about 30 feet from the door enough to see well enough you don't stumble.  The two lamp heads are a plus, as her walk has a corner in it, and you can angle each one to shine where you want it to.  Being LEDs, the bulbs should never need replacing.Installation was simple, just 4 screws & it was up.  It is light & easy to install, and the solar panel can be about 8 feet from the main unit and still have the cord reach, a plus if you want the lights under a door overhang, as you can put the solar panel up where the sunlight will reach it.  Setting takes a little time, but is straightforward.  Adjustments include:  Time 'on' after motion stops, sensitivity, or distance from sensor before the light turns on, and how dark/light you want conditions before the light comes on.  I found it easiest to set the first two settings during the day, with the light adjustment set to full daylight, and then waited in the evening to about the conditions I wanted the light to come on, and set the dark/light dial so it would just turn on.  The instructions warn you only have so much light between charges, so you don't wanting it to turn on during the day if the neighbor's dog wanders by and use up the batteries.What swayed me to this light over others was the fact is uses standard rechargable AA batteries, instead of a special purpose built battery.  When the time comes, I know I'll be able to replace them easily & cheaply."
78557,"I had heard about this series, but didn't watch it.  I started watching on my Amazon Prime and I absolutely love it.  It has a little bit of everything i like; suspense, intrigue, and probabaly supernatural, I haven't watched long enough to know that yet.  I will continue to watch it!"
78558,I loved this - I'm now hooked on the Son's of Anarchy&#34; and will watch the rest of the series!
78559,"I bought these and used them for a week before giving my review.If Amazon used half-stars, I would have given them 3.5/5. I just couldn't bring myself to give them a 4/5 so I went with 3/5, here's why:I've used standard medium picks for over 20 years. Switching to these was not a problem at all. Sure, they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems. By far the biggest change was the &#34;pointy-ness&#34; of the picks. The distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing, especially when playing chords. Everything is much more pronounced, which isn't necessarily a good thing in my opinion. It's especially bad when playing clean electric (picking notes or strumming).If someone was to ask me if these are good picks, my answer would be &#34;it depends.&#34; It really does, in my opinion, it depends on what you're playing. From a rhythm standpoint, I don't like these at all - they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me. For lead work they are OK because you can really dig into each note and have it come through.Could I play faster with them? No. Could I pull off amazing licks that I couldn't do with my normal picks? No.I tried them, but didn't like them. Maybe if you typically play a TON of lead work, constantly, these would be the way to go. I don't, and they aren't for me. I'm glad I tried them, though, because I'll never wonder again if they were for me."
78560,I like this cable for it has an angled plug. It is not that long but no complaints. It works as it should and does well.
78561,"This is a great product that does what it says. It's a tad pricey, but all in all well worth it. My only complaint is that it's not labeled in a way that you can identify what outlet is what when it's mounted in a pedal train... other than that, it's a great device!"
78562,"I purchased this along with a new guitar for my daughter. The item works fine. It is not overly strong or stable, but the prices was right."
78563,"I am already a Johnathan Rhys Myers fan and he does bring sultry to life. It's a nice twist on the Victorian story, does have a tendency to mix the 20th century into the genre, but has nice cinematography and draws me into the story."
78564,This method is must easier than boiling water and waiting for sugar to dissolve. Our hummingbirds didnt seem to notice when we switched.
78565,"I'm a big fan of Chemical Guys' products, but I'd have to say these applicators are just a waste of money and waste of time to use. The most noticeable problem with this poarticular product are the blue plastic sleeves which hold the foam applicators (as seen in the product's picture).Almost immediately upon contact with the tire/rubber surface, the foam comes out of the plastic sleeve, and does so repeatedly. I tried applications with several different pieces and it happened over and over with each of them.Color me un-impressed with this product. Don't waste your money.They look ""nifty"" and ""fancy"", but they are hardly that. If you want quality Chemical Guys applicators, get the green and black contoured applicators which are also in this section. They are superb.These? I'll just mark them down as an abherration."
78566,We have this on top of our stove.  It has some no slip on the bottom and does not move at all during towing.  Nice cutting board also.
78567,"It all came together&#8230;I did not see it  coming, at first. It seemed disjointed, you did not know (or care about, at first) the characters. Then, their motives and intentions started to shine through, and that is when it picked up for me. If it is picked up, I would continue to watch it, and see if it develops."
78568,"Very entertaining, love this show, I wait for it to come out every week very sad its almost over I will have to watch reruns"
78569,"First of all MADE IN CHINA.  You do have to do a little bending banging and even trim your body mount washer a little to install these bars but I expected that from other reviews.  How ever the fact that smittybilt does not seem to give a hoot that the product in not just as simple as bolt on due to the way they built it kind of bothers me I will be going with the Body armor brand for the tube bumpers and doors I just like the step pads for these,  They look great not sure how long the coating will last seems a little cheap."
78570,"I spent the whole time waiting for a point. There was none.  Some of the acting was okay, but ultimately something was lacking.  It just didn't make much sense and was not interesting.  The whole concept had potential, so it was disappointing that it didn't deliver. It dragged on so much that I had the feeling that the story could have been better told in half an hour rather than an hour and a half.  I'm glad it was free to watch."
78571,Cannot wait for the next season to begin. Another 'must watch'. I watched this also on Netflix-- Episode after episode. Love Harvey and Mike and the gang!
78572,this thing is built like a tank and solid. excellent for the price. fits my disc brakes great...it is pretty huge so if youve got small brakes you might have a issue...none with my Vespa 150 but anything smaller you might want to buy in person to make sure..all told...love this lock. easy. quick. solid. and tough. a little 3 n 1 oil really helped it out at first.
78573,A waste of time and $.  Don't fall for this one.  I didn't mind the waste of $1.99 as much as I resented the waste of time.  =(
78574,"great series and good acting, bbc has really great shows I just wish there were more seasons i would defiantly watch it again"
78575,"Quick easy installation with provided zip ties.  Zip them on and feel comfortable with knowing you are not allowing wasp or other insects plug the ventilation or exhaust of your high priced RV frig/freezer.Well worth the investment to keeping your larger investment (RV) safe, sound, and operating as designed.Only one small complaint or suggestion.  These vents come with two zip ties per screen as where I would recommend a minimum of using three per screen."
78576,They can do it with little less skin show and sex. But story line is good and it can be a great show. looking forward to it.
78577,"Well I'm obviously not the only one who thinks this is a great, I mean GREAT series. the actors, the characters played by the actors, the setting, everything is first rate."
78578,"What can I say, I am a string snob! Ive tried MANY different kinds of strings for my acoustics and the Elixir Nanowebs are by far the best strings I have ever played.I had a set of another major brand on a cheap Washburn I bought, and I changed them out with these strings and WOW what a HUGE difference. The guitar has such a great ring to it.Also use these on my Taylors. These will give any quitar a beautiful voice!Pros:LifeSoundPlayabilityQuality and DurabilityCons:Price"
78579,"OK I'm NOT going to say I &#34;love&#34; a sewer hose, but this is a great product and deserves 5 stars.  Whoever you are, you're BRILLIANT for designing this!  Just completed a 6000mile, 2+ month trailer trip and this setup worked flawlessly!  Never evn had a problem with it not being long enough to reach a sewer outlet."
78580,"Loving this show, and my girl &#34;Kate Morgan&#34; from the CHUCK show Yvonne Strahowski. Pretty good show so far and its likely getting better!"
78581,"I purchased this product based on positive reviews by amazon.com customers to restore the rear trim on my 1998 Buick Riviera. While it makes a nice shine, Back to Black did NOT make the trim black again; it remains grey. I expected a more drastic improvement, like some of the tire shine products.In fact, I tried Black Magic &#34;Tire Wet&#34; on the rear trim, and it provides at least as good a shine as Back to Black.Bottom line : product is okay, but will not by any means restore black trim back to black"
78582,"first, i could watch anything with Andre Braugher in it.  he was abaolutely wonderful in the latest ray romano vehicle about three middle aged friends.  i was sad when that show was cancelled as he had done a brilliant job as the son taking over the family business, he plays the captain of the nuclear sub here. however, i am worried about some of the rest of the casting, there is a huge remaining cast which seems to have been primarily picked for looks over talent, especially all of the women in the cast. Andre Braugher going head to head with ray romano is one thing.  his being stranded on a tropical isle with a cast which looks straight outof a lifeguard show is quite another.the premise is interesting but sticks us with this huge cast on a tropical isle. essentially, a US nuclear sub goes rogue with Andre Braugher at the helm. it is now at war with the US and is located with 17 nuclear warheads on an island formerly occupied by NATO. the ship went rogue when it received a possibly bogus attack order to annhilate pakistan.this show could go either way but it needs a fast infusion of other first rate acting talent."
78583,Love Justified. I hate when they cut out Meg and her Boys in season 3 but still enjoy watching every week..
78584,"I have had these levels on 2 campers now, and they've worked great for both units.  The inches indicator appear to be accurate.  If it tells me I'm 3&#34; from level I add (2) 2x6 boards and I'm then level.  If it says I'm 1&#34; from level, then a 1x6 board makes it perfect.  These levels make it very simple to set your camper up properly...no guessing."
78585,"This show deals with a lot of basic little kid problems like being scared to try new things and being upset when things don't work out the way you want them too. I use the episodes to help teach my daughter how to deal with things that she is having a hard time with. This is a Great show for toddlers. It also teaches a few Chinese words each episode, and the main character often addresses the audience to prompt participation."
78586,"Highly recommended.  Just make sure it has ample water to get started (1 gallon minimum).  Used in warm and cooler weather without issue.*Update:  4/2014: after camping an entire season with these, I found that they didn't work very well.  Tissue and waste didn't seem to break down very well, and it most certainly doesn't mask odors very well.  I even tried using 2 packets instead of one (for a 30 gallon tank); no difference aside from things being very blue!I think I'm going to try the ""tried and true"" Happy Campers  Organic treatment next."
78587,"I was determined to make it to the end but I should not have been wanting the film to just be done.  The writer seems to have forgotten where the plot was supposed to go.  Scenes and actions and the choices that the characters make should be derived from the story's thesis---what was the writer's argument about life?  The writer knew the answers at the beginning and then forgot.I was bored throughout.  I got tired of staring at the main character's depressed and confused facial expressions.The main character had no direction in her life but plenty of commitment to self-centeredness.  Worst of all, I did not respect her.  Life just came along and pushed her into choices instead of her being a deliberate actor on her own behalf.  Who was she?  Where was her determination and sense of purpose?  And, finally, as far as the plot conclusion goes, where were the inevitable consequences for her lack of self-determination and purpose?"
78588,"I used to use a lot thinner pick until reading an article from Paul Gilbert saying that in order to play fast you need a minimum of 1mm. These things are great and yes, I can shred faster now!"
78589,ABC and Marvel have developed a strong show capable of both standing on its own and complementing Marvel movies. Each episode has developed the characters and it is obvious the actors actually have a passion for the material.  Clark Gregg and Ming-na Wen are consistently great. You also don't need to be into superheroes to enjoy the show. It is a strong and well done action-spy drama that brings cinematic quality to the small screen and gets better each episode.
78590,"We have this set up to power our 200A panel using an interlock switch and a 30A cable. We also have a watt meter.  This allows the generator to easily power the whole house - minus the central AC units.  There is a very large 6.5 gallon gasoline tank.  In limited testing, we filled with one gallon and it ran about 3 hours under load before running dry.  Be aware that once you use the four prong 30A outlet, the other 110 ac outlets are not powered.It starts easily every time.The exhaust runs pretty hot and shoots from the rear right side near the bottom.  Make sure you have a clear path or things can get red hot after running for a few hours.Now that we have this and are all set up, we virtually guaranteed that we will not lose power again.  Oh well.  At least we are ready."
78591,works fine.  fuse is a 7.5v if that helps anyone.  i have 3 of these and they all work great.
78592,This unit eliminates the need for a gauge and makes the job quicker. More than accurate for me. Fair price.
78593,"Just finished watching this immensely satisfying second series.  I love Timothy Olyphant,  I really do,  but he was almost overshadowed here by the excellent Walton Goggins at Boyd Crowder.  I do love Boyd with his terrific soft voice and frightening manner; he's so charismatic,  every time I see that Nazi tattoo I'm shocked,  it's too easy to forget...The Harlan county folk are causing all sorts of troubles for Givens this season,  and there are some shocking and sad outcomes, as well as some swift and satisfying ones.  I (and everyone else!) particularly liked the character of Mags Bennett, played by Margo Martindale who won a much deserved Emmy for that role.I did find Winona a bit annoying - does she even know why she loves Rayland?  She seems to want him to completely change in order to be with her,  but other than that it was a perfect season. Very much looking forward to watching Season 3...  And very happy with Amazon's unlimited streaming options. That is $70 so well spent!"
78594,Great new challenges and I like the new character. Writers should provide more incremental resolution to sub plots periodically though.
78595,"I had purchased a different strap for my F-style mandolin and it was adequate but when I learned of this Neotech strap and how adjustable it was I ordered it and tossed my earlier strap.  This should be configurable for any mandolin body size and shape and for most human body sizes and shapes as well.  My only complaint is that the button hole doesn't stay on the end pin of my Epiphone mandolin.  I solved that issue though by taking a large triangular pick I wasn't happy with, drilling a hole in the middle and cutting a notch from the edge to the hole and then sliding this over the end-pin of the mandolin and the strap hasn't fallen off since (over 2 months of daily playing!)"
78596,"I'm using this with an Ovation Balladeer. A guitar with a rounded back that demands you use it with a guitar strap at all times. My guitar strap is over 50 years old, circa 1967, so the leather is a bit worn and it had a tendency to slide off the strap holders on the guitar at the most inopportune times.With these strap loks, the strap never comes off. I leave it on when  I put the guitar in the case, and they are there and waiting when I get it back out. I've had it on for 2 and a half months now, with no problems. The hardest part was putting them on, which really wasn't hard at all, just took a moment to understand the mechanics of the mechanism and voila' Bob's your uncle!!Recommend these for anyone who needs to keep their guitar strapped and ready for action. They are plastic and will wear out someday, I'll buy another pair then."
78597,"Bought the Valterra 020106 RV Stabilizer because the theory behind it seems ok.  Took the travle trailer out camping and tried it out, I installed it under the rear sewer hose bumper.  As far as the product working &#34;yes it does keep the trailer sturdy&#34;  I'm  63 and Installing this product I had to lay on the ground to spread out the legs, and keep them steady as I ratcheted it tight. Maybe securing the product in place would help, but then you all ways have to deal with the ratchet on the ground.  The locking rods off of the seissor jack seems the way to go."
78598,"They are actually a 4.5 and I use them on my jack stands but they fall off until I have the weight of the car touching them. Other than that these things do not cut, tear, and or smash and loose their shape."
78599,I notice this product works faster if I added a lot of shredded leaves (carbon source).Tips:- Turn over or mix the compost once a week- Too much water will slow down the composting process- Kitchen garbage is a good starter but brown leaves are the fuel of compostHappy composting!
78600,"I replaced the blades on my 2007 Toyota Corolla with this blade and theBosch 24-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade - 24"".  The blades they replaced were a pair of OEM blades that I picked up from the dealership during routine maintenance late last year. The OEM blades were worn, performing poorly and leaving streaks behind, so it was definitely time for replacement. The Bosch CA blades easily snapped right onto the vehicle in seconds. The CA blades are thicker and much more solid looking than the OEM blades they replaced. Although they work fantastic in the rain, the real test is how well they will perform in extreme conditions (snow, ice, high winds, etc) and how long they last. I replaced three wiper blades (front and rear) on my 2006 Sienna with Bosch Evolution blades this past March. All three are still working perfectly and I have been happy with them so far. I installed the Evolution blades just before spring, so although they did great with the spring and summer rain storms, I haven't yet had a chance to test them with snow and ice yet. So this winter will be a test for both Bosch models. As long as they both handle the snow and ice reasonably well, the best performer will be the replacement blade of choice for both of my vehicles next year."
78601,Still one of the top three shows on television. A shame so many people think a &#34;cartoon&#34; is for children. Their loss.
78602,"I enjoy detailing my car.  Although I used many tire shine products, I wanted to find one that had the right balance between shind and protection.  Many of the tire shine products weaken the tire walls or interact with the rubber.  Others have &#34;fling&#34; and unable to hold the shine.  I found I needed to touch it up at least 1x per week.  This product is easy to apply and has held the &#34;black&#34; well for the past several weeks.  It isn't as shiny as other silicone based products but it also is safer for your tire.  I wanted a product that will keep my tire a dark black for at least a month.  This does it."
78603,Using this tool will make the job go so much easier.  Makes the hard part unplugging your sensor and feeding the new one correctly to reconnect it.
78604,"I like how this fits in my 5-gallon bucket and traps the dirt.  I use a 2-bucket system and this helps clean the microfiber mits, too.  A little pricey, but I don't see replacing it for a LONG time!"

78606,"I was looking for a better lock that didn't rust, and this is the one. The lock is simple to operate and includes a rubber cover over the key hole. Looks great too with a black bumper."
78607,"This product serves its purpose...especially for price...but at a cost. And by ""cost"" I mean fuses. Granted, most 2 outlet adapters in this price range don't even have a fuse so they either die or fry your electronics. These, however, are fused and the fuses can be replaced. Pick up a pack of extra fuses and keep them in the glove box."
78608,"I like the characters in this show. They are well developed. The topic is interesting with planted spies living as Americans, but working with the KGB. This show is worth watching."
78609,We need more series like this one...I loved the educational views and the depiction of life from the moguls were transformed this country in the beginning of our industrial age. As a history buff I enjoyed watching the masterpiece timeline...I want to see more!
78610,"excellent in all respects,"
78611,"Orb-3 Spa Enzymes worked great at breaking down inside dirt from our home spa tub.  I use this for my large spa tub in my master bathroom as an extra cleaning boost.  It is best to use with warm water.  It worked great at breaking down enzymes and spa junk that other chemicals didn't seem to get.  I've put other harsher cleaners and bleach in my spa tub but Orb-3 Spa Enzymes still was able to get some deep cleaning done!  I was really surprised how much oil buildup was still left inside the pipes of my spa!  This is an excellent product, and it's green. I will purchase this product in the future."
78612,I installed 4 of these on my 1996 Chevy K1500. Two work well but the other two are difficult to pull up. I usually need to use a screw driver.
78613,"I've been trying out different picks for a few weeks now looking for the perfect one for hybrid picking. So far this is the one and I think my search is actually over. I've tried theJim Dunlop 427P3 Dun Ultex Jazz Iii Ply Pkand that was close but this is the one. These Davas have a great feel in my bigger fingers, doesn't slip around at all and is very sharp and fast on alternate and hybrid picking. Pick noise has also been reduced because there is much less friction than with most others; the notes ring out very clearly even on fast runs."
78614,I've had several sets of the ratching style jack stands. There only ever seemed to be one variable among them: how high they raise the car. These aren't the highest jack stands but they have a nice flat base and provide a solid foundation for the car.
78615,"I needed this item for an air compressor that draws 15A, and my 12V socket can only handle 10A.  This item is perfect, and small enough to fit in my air compressor's case.  It would be nice if we know how many amps it could handle, but the wire gauge provided is more than enough for my 15A need."
78616,"I'm incredibly particular about what I use when detailing my cars, and I'm happy to say that the Heininger towels made it onto my personal list of ""approved"" products.First, I like the size of these towels - at 12x16, they're somewhat larger than the other brands I use. I find myself usually folding these sorts of towels into small squares, and the extra size gives me more working time with a single towel...definitely a plus. They are also very soft and absorbent, but still seem able to hold up to hard use.About the only gripe is that they tend to shed a bit when brand new out of the box. I used one to clean my windshield, and I could see a series of fine threads afterwards left on my window. Wash a few times and this is gone - but other brands seem a bit better out of the box. Still, the size, thickness and softness make up for it, and at the price, these are definitely worth checking out."
78617,"Every person that changes their own oil needs one of these. It is a perfect fit.Simply attach a 15/16 socket to your torque wrench, attach this filter to the socket, and the rest is just as easy as can be. Perfect"
78618,"Fits the grease gun well, was easy to mount, and uses a flip-tab device to release the gun. Nice thing is, the bracket puts no pressure on the wall, so you're not going to need to secure it any further. As another reviewer mentioned, if you grease often, this bracket keeps the gun upright and out of the way, preventing grease from getting onto anything else. Well worth it."
78619,I love that part of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood is still available to children of today. I am glad that my son likes it.
78620,"""Lovelace"" is an extreme waste of some talented people.  Amanda Seyfreid plays the lead of a movie supposedly based on the book ""Ordeal"" written by now infamous porn starlet Linda Lovelace.  Ms. Lovelace's claim to fame was her ability to perform a certain sexual act that most people (apparently) did not know existed.  The trouble with the movie is there's just nothing to it:  just several scenes strung together by the flimsiest notion.  No character is given a chance to appear human.  I guess Seyfreid does a so-so job of portraying Linda Lovelace.  Lovelace (who is now deceased from injuries suffered in a car accident) has been out of the spotlight for about 40 years, so unless you are familiar with the back story here, you might be left scratching your head in puzzlement.The movie would have you believe that Lovelace--like so many other girls who ""fall"" into the porn industry--was misled by her mean old boyfriend, who exploited her every chance he got, sexually and mentally abused her, and she was this complete victim.  Welllll....if you do a little research on Ms. Lovelace, you'll find she was not all that innocent, and that only confuses this more for the viewer of this film.  She supposedly did a few ""loop"" films (16mm porn films), and she was involved in beastiality in one of those.  The cameraman on that film was interviewed and stated she ""was a very willing participant"" when she made that film.  I also remember her interview with ""Playboy"" wherein she talked openly about what kind of sex she preferred and in what order.""Lovelace"" tries at break-neck speed to cover all the bases about her life:  how she got started, how she met her boyfriend who got her started, how she SUPPOSEDLY only made the one porn film, i.e. Deep Throat, how she abused drugs, etc., but the film only manages to scratch the surface on EVERY subplot.  Seyfreid's supporting cast includes Chris Noth, Sharon Stone (in one of the WORST fright wigs I've ever seen), and Robert Patrick.I don't know exactly what the director was going for here, but whatever it was, he certainly missed the mark.  Rated ""R"" for sexual situations, violence, and some drug use.  Not Recommended."
78621,"Rome, HBO's ambitious, and expensive, series revolving around the events leading up to the assassination of Julius Caesar (Ciaran Hinds), is a sight to behold.  Created and filmed by a plethora of talented individuals (including legendary film maverick John Milius), Rome is brought to life with a fantastic set design that must be seen to be believed; it's as if the city is breathing.  The story follows two of Caesar's soldiers (Ray Stevenson and Trainspotting's Kevin McKidd) who find themselves throughout many events in Roman history, beginning with inadvertantly rescuing Octavian (Max Pirkis), being lost at sea, assisting Cleopatra (in more than one way, this episode will leave you laughing) and Caesar's struggle with Pompey Magnus (Kenneth Cranham).  Despite some historical inaccuracies, Rome is everything you'd come to expect from an HBO series: rich characterizations, an engrossing story, and a superbly assembled, large cast (including James Purefoy as Marc Antony, Kerry Condon, and Polly Walker as the scheming Atia), Rome is compulsively addictive viewing, made even more so by the climax and of the season finale, which will have you begging for more."
78622,"I had reservations about watching this film, the Zombie genre at least in my opinion has lost it's impact. Most follow the same old repetitive theme established decades ago by the great George Romero. That said  ""Contracted"" was a welcome surprise. Although plagued with problems the film delivers genuine thrills and plenty of un nerving scares.Young Director Eric England (Madison County, The Settling, Hell bent) puts his own definitive spin on Contracted and it's well worth the watch.The performances lack depth with the exception of Najarr Townsend who plays the lead character ""Samantha"". After contracting a rare strain of a sexually transmitted disease her decomposing both mentally and physically is grueling to watch. And her performance is fearless and bold she rises above both the flawed script and weak essential characters that remain under the bar.Her performance is both riveting and incredibly disturbing. Although not as an original take on the Zombie genre as say Danny Boyels ""28 Days Later"" it's a unique spin on an all to often formula based and repetitive genre.Most definitely worth a watch for Horror Fans."
78623,"You know who Hannibal Lector is, even if you've never seen ""Red Dragon"" or ""The Silence of the Lambs"" -- a witty, cultured man who happens to be a cannibalistic serial killer.He is also the sinister heart of ""Hannibal: Season One,"" a TV show somewhat based on the works and characters of Thomas Harris. This is one of the smartest shows on television today -- a thorny, dark-hearted psychodrama, full of subtle manipulation and dangerous killers. It took a few episodes for me to fully warm up to Mads Mikkelson, but after awhile his quietly aesthetic portrayal really caught on.FBI special investigator Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) has a special gift -- he is able to empathize with serial killers, understanding how their minds work. Agent Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) enlists him to help in the most bizarre serial killing cases, and enlists forensic psychiatrist Hannibal Lector (Mikkelson) to keep Will from going off the rails.And frankly, Will needs the help. His first case involves a cannibalistic serial killer known as the Minnesota Shrike, who kills young girls and almost murders his daughter Abigail. As Will struggles with the aftermath of this case, he is called in on a series of bizarre murders -- people turned into grotesque angels, mutilated into instruments, used as fungal fertilizer, missing children turned into murderers, an organ harvester, and a man who claims to be the notorious Chesapeake Ripper.But Will suspects that a copycat killer is at large, using other serial killers as a smokescreen for his own activities. He doesn't suspect that the copycat killer is far closer than he thinks: Dr. Lector (this isn't much of a spoiler -- it's revealed in the first episode), who manipulates Crawford, Will, his shrink friend Dr. Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas), and anyone else who falls into his orbit. Oh, and he eats people.Bryan Fuller has always had a macabre streak (see ""Pushing Daisies"" or ""Dead Like Me""), but in ""Hannibal,"" that streak covers the whole canvas. Don't expect quirkiness or comedy in this -- it's all shadows, grey skies and blood, with only a few lighter moments (Will spending time with his dogs) to gently remind you that the world is not all horror.It also doesn't have any supernatural quirks, yet it still maintains a dreamlike, almost mystical quality through Will's hallucinations, and the ghostlike elusiveness of the killers. Lector himself is almost like an elegant demon, conjuring complicated tortures and schemes while also listening to classical music and frying up gourmet meals of human flesh. His cultured calm seems almost inhuman, his cold sadism and elusiveness almost beyond human understanding.It's also gory. Very gory. Admittedly you can't have a story about serial killers and cannibalism without some gore, but it has some truly grotesque, stomach-churning stuff that you wouldn't expect to find on network shows.And while coming up with a bunch of one-off serial killings -- only some of which are successfully stopped -- the writers weave in elaborate subplots involving a potentially psychotic teenager, the Chesapeake killer, a murdered protege of Crawford's, and Will's increasing mental deterioration. Every episode creeps us closer to Will figuring out what is truly going on, and who is pulling the strings on everyone around him.Dancy plays Will as a shaky, damaged man whose special talents are slowly destroying him, but who feels that he must continue to save others' lives. Fishburne is the steady rock at the center of the show, an essentially decent man who must sacrifice Will's well-being so that other people have a chance to live. And it has good supporting performances by Dhavernas, Gillian Anderson and Hettienne Park.I have to admit, Mads Mikkelson annoyed me for the first two episodes -- he seemed very passionless and wooden at first. But his acting style began to grow on me as we see the few things that bring a sparkle to his eye (mostly classical music), and explore some of his cold, friendless world.""Hannibal Season One"" is a series as rich and dark as spilled lifeblood... and about as horrifying. Intelligent, grotesque and powerful."
78624,"First off, walking dead, breaking bad, spartacus are awesome 5 star shows. Then you have the b class and lower. This was enjoyable for me the first season, the 2nd especially the superhero girls etc just started getting tired and over the top. I lump this in with SleepyHollow, cant even make it through the first season even though I already paid for it. I will say I am still watching revolution though and it keeps my interest. I am done watching the arrow even though you can catch free episodes. This is just how it goes for most shows, only a few can be good or great"
78625,"Well written and acted.  Noah Wiley is exceptional in this as are the other actors. Story is believable and could happen that way,"
78626,"Season 2 was as enjoyable as season 1.  I liked that the issues changed and matured with the teens. H2O reminded me of Flipper and Gidget from the 1960s.  The plots ran to sibling rivalry, fights with each other and boyfriends, misunderstandings, embarrassments, and the joy of swimming and playing in the water. Must see for teens who like fantasy, The scenery is beautiful.  The costumes superb.  Some of the special effects are silly, but easily overlooked."
78627,I love this guitar strap button. It's a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in. I actually purchased it for my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pink. It works well for it's stated purpose and appears to be of high quality. The leather is nice and soft and the button fits snuggly into the leather hole. Check out my user name stinkylungs on Youtube to see a video I made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close.
78628,"This little unit is packed with great effects. For $50, I'm very impressed. Has just about everything you need in a entry-level pedal, except for a pedal control!!"
78629,"This year is so fast-paced that I am constantly surprised by what is happening. The trend seemed clear, then BANG, the plot went another way. I am looking forward to more in February..."
78630,"interesting concept and story.  ok acting, but no &#34;memorable&#34; performances. interesting special effects. I will probably continue to watch this show to see what's next."
78631,This is yet another Brit TV show with real characters and great acting with a touch of humor thrown in.Lots of familiar faces in the cast including the lead actor Alan Davies who is always enjoyable.
78632,"Trimmer line that fits, is relatively easy to work with and inexpensive. I am only 1/3 thru the package and if the trimmer itself lasts then I will buy more line like this. It's great stuff"
78633,"I love this car soap, it's just rather expensive. However, unlike many other car soaps, like Meguiars Gold Class (which is easy to find locally and less expensive), this needs very little to create a lot of suds. This is a very rich soap that clings to the paint while you are washing, helping to protect your finish from dirt and other debris that could scratch. Highly recommend."
78634,"Ive been using this polish since the early 80's. It doesn't smell the way some do and works fantastic on all of my guitars. Wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars. What has hurt my guitars is me dropping them or sweating all over them, but this polish? No way. Martin knows what they're doing. I use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes."
78635,"I can, and have been, critical of Lifetime made-for-TV movies for ripping &#34;based on actual events&#34; cases from the headlines and turning them into rather lurid fodder for fictionalized dramatic recreations. It is one of their go-to genres. Sometimes you don't need all the sensationalistic melodrama when the tale itself is both compelling and fascinating. And in the simplicity of its presentation, &#34;Abducted: The Carlina White Story&#34; is one of the network's more heartfelt entries into this overstuffed format. Level-headed and real, this accounting benefits from an understated tone and (at least) one truly dynamic performance. While the screenplay sometimes takes some major shortcuts which sacrifice significant parts of the actual story, it is still one of the better efforts from Lifetime that I've seen in quite some time. And, in all candor, it is a film that I had almost no interest in seeing! Well, I'm glad I didn't listen to myself. What do I know anyway?&#34;Abducted&#34; tells the story of a girl who was stolen from the hospital shortly after her birth. As the parents pursue any lead, the case makes headlines that only intensify when they also seek to hold the hospital legally responsible. As they come to terms with the difficulties of losing their daughter, the abductor proceeds to raise the child for the next two decades! The case once again made headlines when Carlina White, as an adult, began to unravel the secret and seek out her real family. She is placed in an untenable position. Should she embrace the family she has never known? And if so, does that mean she has to cut ties with her entire existence. It's a knotty dilemma, handled reasonably well in the hands of director Vondie Curtis-Hall. I wish the story would have spent more time on the arising suspicions and the process of what happens, but much of that is left to the imagination. Her investigation into her identity consists of a couple of Internet searches, that's how little effort is spent on this portion of the tale.But despite its shortcomings, &#34;Abducted&#34; should be lauded for its incredible lead performance by Aunjanue Ellis. Ellis plays the unstable woman responsible for the kidnapping, and it's a role of great passion and vigor. Ellis always seems to be the most unpredictable actress in whatever role she is undertaking, and here that really pays off. You can't take your eyes off her when she's on the screen, and I missed her when she was not. Other major players include Sherri Shepherd, a nice change of pace as the other mother, and Keke Palmer as a grown Carlina. Overall, this is such a fascinating story, you'll definitely want to see how it plays out. It sometimes falls into the trap of the typical TV movie by-the-numbers narrative, but Ellis is always quick to give the film a jolt of energy just when it needs it the most! KGHarris, 2/13."
78636,"This is a tough premise to believe, and to accept, that a dirty cop would be put in this position.  But of course, it theoretically occurred in a deal with a dirty politician....  yet, this actor does a great job, and I have liked his coarse but intelligent portrayals in other shows, such as in Castle.  Try it... if you like tough cop shows, this may work for you."
78637,"We have a small Weber grill we use to cook out occasionally. When we do cook out, I usually just buy whatever kind of charcoal is available at the corner supermarket. Last weekend we tried these coconut shell briquettes to make hamburgers. My husband loaded the briquettes along with some tinder in a metal chimney style charcoal starter.  The coals got hot as quickly as regular charcoal and the burgers cooked up just fine.  The only difference we noticed was that the coals were a little smokier to start off with than the charcoal we regularly use. This may have been partly our fault as we ordered these briquettes awhile back and then left them sitting in our garage for some time during all kinds of weather before we tried them. It is possible the smoky part wouldn't have happened if we hadn't let the briquettes sit around for as long as we did in a sometimes damp, uninsulated garage. Beside a little bit of extra smoke at the beginning the cookout, the burgers tasted fine and we didn't notice much difference compared to regular charcoal.I received these free from the Vine program and am considering stocking up on these on a regular basis. I like the idea of recycling natural coconut shells into a useful product."
78638,This is a HILARIOUS SHOW!  Each actor has been perfectly picked for their role. I love Betty White. I think this is the best series she's ever starred in. They all have great chemistry with each other. You can tell they genuinely live working together. Great guest stars too.
78639,"I own a BMW and the front wheel get caked with brake dust very quickly. I have tried various products including wheel wax and was not satisfied with the results. With Wheel Wax, it is a hassle to rub it on and wipe off. Also, it does nothing to repel dust except make it easier to clean. With this armor all wheel protectant, it saves me time and hassle. It is so easy to just spray it on and let it dried by itself. It doesn't cloud the finish of my silver painted wheel either. I did a test by just spray it on one of the wheels and drove the car for a month without washing. The other 3 wheels were caked with brake dust. The wheel with this protectant look a lot cleaner and was very easy to clean off. Highly recommended product!!I usually don't like Armor All product but this is an exception."
78640,"5 STARS ALL THE WAY! This show has ALL the bells, and whistles and all that other good stuff!! The chemistry of the cast of this show truly has that power to grab your attention and keep you affixed to the screen, relishing each and every second! Gemma Teller sure ain't no, Peg Bundy!!"
78641,"My issue with the Pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply. I have a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus.The documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board, and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply. However, if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested, you're in for an unpleasant surprise.First of all, regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board. The fitment to the power supply is there... sort of. There's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together. I wasn't worried about this, since I doubt I'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.The second issue is, the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter. Once you've got them in (or attempted to do so), they're never coming out. You'll probably have to break them. It's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.The main issue I have with this board relating to my Voodoo Lab power supply is this. Once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board (it can only go one place), you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don't fit the mounting location on this board. You can't plug them in because there's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.I really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the Voodoo Lab power supply I own, but given that it doesn't fit like it's supposed to, I wish I could return this board - except I can't, because it now has holes drilled in it. (You have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it.)Basically, I paid $100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro. Needless to say, I'm not very pleased."
78642,"My only gripe is each episode is only 22 minutes long.  This cartoon should be 45 minutes long each week.  It's the best cartoon ever.Season 2 ended with Archer's fiance' being killed and he kind of loses it.  He goes missing for 3 months but his mother hires an ex-ISIS guy named Rip Riley (Patrick Warburton) an adventurer (and former lover of Archer's mom) who finds Archer on a tropical island working as a bartender and sleeping with newlywed women in order to destroy the marriage (I think... it's hard to tell why he does the things he does). When Archer refuses to leave and instead smashes a glass bottle into Rip's face, Rip takes Archer by force onto his plane in handcuffs; basically kidnapping him to return him to his mom.A lot happens but basically Rip and Archer wind up captured by pirates until Archer kills the leader of the pirates and becomes the new leader of the pirates, and Archer apparently embraces his new profession when he announces that he is now the Pirate King!I hope so much that Rip winds up being Archer's real father.  THIS is a character that could actually be the father of someone like Archer.  Those other losers... bleh."
78643,"This product is labeled as ""Deer Off"" but it says it works for rabbits also.  We have had terrible rabbit problems in our decorative garden.  They eat a lot of the young plants so we gave this a try.  The product is a liquid mix for mixing with water.  It comes with a cup.  The cup is a little small so the required proportion results in the cup being full to the top of the cup making it inconvenient to use as it could spill easily.  The product properly mixed is then sprayed onto the plants that you need protection.  You are not supposed to use it on plants that will be eaten.  The plants we have that have been sprayed with this product have not been touched by rabbits for about a week which is a pretty good indication that it works.  We will need more time to be more sure but it looks very good.  There is a strong smell to it but that is not really an issue.  It is supposed to be made of natural ingredients.  I would not put it on vegetables that you will eat but for decorative plants and flowers, this stuff is good for repelling rabbits at least.  For other animals, we do not really know.  It is supposed to work with the smell to alert the animals that either it is not suitable that there are preditors around."
78644,"The price goes up and down and I waited until it was the lowest I've seen to buy. This device does it all and was showing me codes I have never seen from my truck. It's very detailed and easy to use for the most part. Amazon has the best price usually, but again, monitor the price for awhile and get it when the price is low."
78645,It says for a Banjo or a Mandolin but ukulele is the first instrument listed on the box. It is just the right size to clamp over four strings and taking it on/off is really easy.
78646,for the price and effect itself u can not get a better deal.use it for my acoustic guitar  pedal board though. it just does the job and im more than satisfied.it works awesome with electric guitar too. just get it!
78647,"I noticed a couple of rat dropping in our garden, so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try out the zapper.  We have many fruit trees on our hillside below our house, so it is not uncommon for us to have critters wander our flower gardens around our house during the warm months.  I followed the instructions and baited the trap with dry dof kibble in the back of the trap and left it off to lure the rat into feeling comfortable about the trap (apparently they are very skittish). After checking daily I found the kibble was eaten (it took about 10 days), so I reloaded the trap and turned it on.  After another three weeks there has been no activity in the trap, also the low battery light is on.It is unclear if we still have the rat or if it moved on.  We are blessed to have many raptors in our area (hawks, owls, turkey vultures) so it is possible the varmit succumbed to the Circle of Life.  Either way, I am disappointed that the batteries went dead.  As far as the idea that there is no mess; I have doubts about that.  There have been times when we have caught critters with the snap trap (still my favorite method) and they have oozed their bodily fluids.  If that happens in this trap will it not short itself out? There is still clean up of the inside of the trap after a kill.  You need to wipe it down once you dump the body.  This is where the snap trap excels.  Yes you have to see the body, but the snap trap is less than a couple of bucks, so i just toss it.I have not given up hope on the trap and if I ever catch anything in it I will edit this post.  But at this point I prefer the old fashioned snap trap. Sometimes you just have to get you hands dirty."
78648,"First, this is a good product if you want to tint your tail lights on a budget.  However, there are many drawbacks to using this product.Pros:Affordable alternative to otherwise time consuming tinting or opting to take it to a costly shop to have it done ""right"".When done ""correctly"" you may achieve good results.  However, doing this job correctly may take some knowledge with painting/color sanding and other prep work related to body work.Cons: Easy to mess up, by messing up I mean getting runs from spraying too wet/close, nobody likes the runs.Does not hide imperfections.Easy to apply too much when you think you still might want them a little darker.There really are no instructions on the can.  Do not expect the can to tell you what to do/what not to do.  From MY experience with this or any product I can however give some general rule of thumb tips.  Some will still have their drawbacks.This is how I did it:You will need:  Dawn dish soap.  Original formula!  Not the newer ""ultra concentrated"". Spray bottles at least 1, 2 are better.  Latex or equivalent gloves.  2000 Grit wet sanding paper.  Running alcohol 50/50 water mix.  Water (obviously), masking tape, a solid flat surface to work on, quality lighting, quality ventilation, and the VHT/Clearcoat, of course. Finally, A LOT OF PATIENCE. Optional:  Meguiars ultimate compound, microfiber towels, a dual action polisher/soft buff polishing pad.Step 1.  I REMOVED my tail lights.  No sense trying to spray them on the vehicle, unless you want to spend all of the time to mask it off correctly at which point you would have them off by now anyway.Step 2. PUT LATEX or VINYL GLOVES ON!!! You'd be amazed at how much oil your hands are producing and believe me, it will effect your overall quality of work.  I followed up my soapy water wash with a 50/50 alcohol/water mix for final prep prior to sanding.  I thoroughly cleaned the tail lights with good old fashioned Regular dawn dish soap and warm water, followed by a rinse off.  Sounds cheap?  You'd be surprised how far back the ORIGINAL formula dawn dish soap has been utilized in the body industry, it is a great degreaser.Step 3.  Put a new pair of gloves on. Don't want to get waterlogged or have water running out of them.Step 4. Mask anything on the light that you don't want sprayed, IE: Inner edges, reverse light, whatever. I wet-sanded my tail lights with 2000 grit sand paper and another solution of dawn/water via spray bottle.  Keep the paper/surface wet.  Make sure you sand the entire surface uniformly and with mild pressure.  Don't try digging yourself through the other end of these lights, we will get to the reason why I myself chose the 2000 grit and nothing more abrasive or nothing at all a little later on.Step 5.  Rinse off your headlights, lightly towel dry them and inspect.  Let them dry completely.  They will appear hazed/foggy.  Any spots that you missed or didn't scuff up enough will retain it's original gloss and should be corrected prior to advancing to the next step.Step 6.  Once you are satisfied with your wet sanding I recommend following up with another misting via spray bottle of 50/50 water/rubbing alcohol to be certain that the tail lights are free of any dust/grease particles prior to painting.  It never hurts to be safe and by the time you are done doing all of this work you will either thank yourself in the end or curse yourself for not taking that one last just in case effort.Step 7.  Apply light, uniform coats of the VHT night shades spray tint.  I applied my first coat at a distance around 8-12"".  Maintain some level of overlap to assure uniform coverage I recommend anything from 25% overlap min to 50% overlap max.  Spray the edges first, work quickly yet taking your time, if that makes sense. Depending on humidity and temperature I would let the first coat sit for bare minimum of 10 minutes before applying any additional coats, if its cool or humid wait about 15 minutes, don't fall into the urge of touching the surface to check whether or not it feels dry to touch, especially if you ever plan to use your tail light for committing a crime.  Your prints will be etched into them and forensics will be all over it.Step 8.  Let it dry, dry, dry, I recommend waiting a bare minimum of 45 minutes to an hour before clear coating.  You do not want to let the clear coat blend into the paint.  This might be overkill but if you clear too soon your lights will look dull/cloudy.Step 9.  Apply clear coat, some people recommend as much as 4 coats, 6 light coats, whatever you desire basically.  Clear coat is a little bit different, you should spray it on wet enough to assure you don't have ""dry"" little specks all over yet it is very easy to get it to run.  You have already gotten this far without messing up so just like painting take your time.  Spray the first coat on light, follow up with one, maybe even 2 wetter coats. I think anything more than 3 general coats is overkill.Step 10.  Let it dry, dry, dry, no, it's not ready to be touched yet!  Let it dry for as long as possible before handling.  I would recommend letting it dry no less than a few hours before handling, just to be safe.  If possible, let it dry for at least 6 hours before re-installing them on your vehicle.  If it is going to rain later on that day/night I would recommend just installing them the next day.OPTIONAL..  There are 3 possibilities here.  You are either finished at this point, if so, congratulations on a job well done!  OR, you can continue on to the steps, OR, you have made a mistake and are not satisfied.  If you have made a mistake swallow your pride and let these things dry for as long as possible before attempting to follow all of the steps over again if going the sanding route.  Acetone, goo gone, or whatever you might consider using works great when the product is still in its out gassing/curing stage if you would go the quick fix method where time is money.Step 11. You may have noticed orange peel, (little bumps all over the place)  Don't worry, you didn't do anything wrong this is entirely normal with clear coat.  This can be corrected very easily by letting the lights dry for no less than 24 hours IMO and gently once again wet sanding the clear coat smooth with 2000 grit wet sandpaper. Same soapy water mix, light pressure, work a little at a time and a squeegy works great for wiping off residue to show you how much work you have left to do.Step 12:  So you are all smooth, and now your work surface looks like crap.  Darn, he got me, all this work and now it's all hazy/messed up.  Did I just scare you?  You can remove this haze by using Meguiars ultimate polishing compound(which I used) or equivalent.  I have a lot of experience with a dual action buffer I used gentle pressure on a low speed and lightly agitated the surface with my soft buff foam polishing pad. Work it long enough and you can probably achieve comparable results by hand.  I followed up with a finishing glaze/gentle hand buff for optimal results.Step 13:  Now those are some nicely smoked tail lights, congrats!So I gave a lot of steps, everyone has their own feedback based on their own experience, or lack thereof, are all of these steps necessary to everyone?  No.  But, they were how I was taught and my overall desire to make the most out of my $20.00 spent.  I just recently did a full repaint on my 1994 Ford Bronco Eddie Bauer that used to be a rust bucket, no, I didn't use spray can I used PPG omni urethane automotive dual stage paint w/my spray gun and achieved great results.  I wouldn't have achieved those results without proper preparation/precautionary measures, painting is actually the easy part of body work.  So I didn't want to throw a hurried up/half asked job of tail light tinting on my otherwise nice looking vehicle.  I am an automotive detailer and have my share of experience in the field of auto body work as well so I am very picky about how something looks, especially when I do the job myself.Either way you get what you pay for and this is a ""spray can"" job.  Following my own knowledge I made the most out of what it is and they turned out rather nice.  I wouldn't recommend more than 2 coats as 3 is too much IMO (I've learned from my own mistakes) and like the other reviewer said your lights can be very hard to see through especially in the day time because of it.  1 coat offers little results (too light, just barely darker than stock) and 3 too dark, 2 seems just right IMO.  Unless you like that really black look and aren't too concerned about safety for yourself and others, or if you are doing really light coats.Make use out of the flash times between coats and do yourself a favor and walk away.  It is far too easy to get a sense of urgency and over excited and want these things back on your car/truck.  It's MUCH better to wait 5 minutes too long than 5 minutes too soon.  And for heavens sake, DON'T TOUCH!  At least not yet.  Try to do this on a day when the air temperature is at least 65 degrees with low relative humidity.  Dry warm air works much better to help you than cool/moist air.  Try doing this in a dust free/bug free environment.  I have too much experience painting in my own garage and for whatever crazy reason bugs seem to LOVE the scent of paint materials...  I actually bought a garage door screen to help prevent them from coming in yet still provide adequate ventilation.  That's just me though, I didn't buy it for this purpose I bought it for purposes like this on a frequent basis.Safety first! (yet I managed to think of it last) If you are really worried about health wear a particulate respirator and safety glasses.I know this is a long review and I know everyone has their own opinion on what should/shouldn't be done.  The reason I listed the tips is for the new to this type of work person that has an interest in undergoing this project on their own with little knowledge on how to do it.  If you have old/beat up lights to work with consider replacing them before undergoing this project. OR:  Wet-sand with a 1500 or even 1000 grit paper and follow up with a 1500-2000 grit.. Personally I know from experience that the 20 year old tail lights on my vehicle that were scratched and scuffed didn't turn out well... I replaced them and now I am much more satisfied with the end result.One final note, - THE REASON IT ONLY GETS 3 STARS - I promise it's the last thing I'll say... For the skeptics/what to REALLY expect.  If you wet sand with the 2000 grit paper you will likely see minor imperfections under the paint/clearcoat  This is why I didn't do anything more abrasive than 2000 grit... This will show more prominently under direct light instances and up close inspections..  This is because this tint/clear coat really doesn't have any filling properties like you would expect out of a primer.  With that being said, obviously you can't prime your work prior to painting in this case so you either have to accept a some imperfections OR you could go the route of NOT wet sanding and go straight to painting after a good cleaning but I wouldn't do this... The reason why I wouldn't is from my own experience when you don't do some light scuffing the paint tends not to have good adhesion at all.  Making it much easier to create runs and or peeling in the more immediate future than the next guy."
78649,I liked the actors who played all the parts. I also liked that he didn't show off because he was smart and the love for his grandmother.
78650,"How revelatory must a film truly be to include the director&#8217;s name above the picture&#8217;s title?  I suppose the answer will always be, &#8220;That depends on the director.&#8221;  For example, I can&#8217;t imagine that there are crowds of anxious movie-goers lined up anticipating WOODY ALLEN&#8217;S DRACULA.  Granted, the kids might pour out in droves for MICHAEL BAY&#8217;S DRACULA.  Maybe you could interest most of middle-class America to pony up their ten bucks a-piece on STEVEN SPIELBERG&#8217;S DRACULA.  Such is life.For those who know the name Dario Argento, I&#8217;d imagine ARGENTO&#8217;S DRACULA might have particular significance.  Indeed, Argento has a fan-base of impressive proportions amongst cinema aficionados and horror buffs, but, outside of those two groups, is he a household name?  That was probably a question producers were asking in late 2013 when this film was released merely as DRACULA 3D; it largely went unattended in the marketplace, which caused them to drop the whole three-D thing and just emphasize the &#8216;Argento&#8217; in the new DVD release.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Jonathan Harker (played by Unax Ugalde) is summoned to the castle of the Count Dracula (an impressive Thomas Kretschmann) where he&#8217;s to begin work as the resident librarian, cataloguing all of his employer&#8217;s expansive book collection.  However, once Harker seems to have vanished, his lovely wife Mina (a pleasingly attractive Marta Gastini) follows in his footsteps, seeking to uncover the truth of her love&#8217;s disappearance.  Before all is said and done, she&#8217;ll require the services of Abraham Van Helsing (the ever-reliable Rutger Hauer) to bring about an end to a vile agreement between Dracula and the townspeople he&#8217;s duped into subservience.I haven&#8217;t read Bram Stoker&#8217;s classic novel (it&#8217;s on my bucket list), so I couldn&#8217;t say how faithful ARGENTO&#8217;S DRACULA remains to STOKER&#8217;S DRACULA.  I can say that the story certainly feels as if some minor effort went into capturing this tale as an effective but low-budget period production.  Everything &#8220;looks&#8221; old age, but, by that same barometer, everyone &#8220;looks&#8221; like they&#8217;re acting, too.  For my tastes, Argento&#8217;s work is staged and photographed far too passively to evoke the legitimately lurid sensibilities only effectively hinted at in a few key scenes, and, sadly, there&#8217;s just an awful lot of bloat to this work.  At nearly two hours, this version of the immortal bloodsucker is arguably thirty minutes too long.There&#8217;s far too much set-up required in the tale as told, scripted by Argento and Antonio Tentori, Stefano Piani, and Enrique Cerezo (also listed as &#8216;producer&#8217;).  Lucy (Asia Argento) goes about her life in the village, secretly consorting with the leader of the vampires, and her story could&#8217;ve easily been heavily truncated to balance out the flow of the first half.  Also, there are a handful of scenes involving the locals that &#8211; while their inclusion might help establish a plot point &#8211; don&#8217;t truly add much depth to the overall narrative.  In fact, by the time Van Helsing shows up to finally go &#8216;Grandpa Bad@ss&#8217; on everyone, I&#8217;d pretty much lost interest in everyone except Dracula.Despite all of these blemishes, Kretschmann (as the Count) turns in a nice main performance.  His Dracula is only charismatic in measured doses, fleshing out the ruler of the undead by giving him some emotional layers.  This, too, unfortunately doesn&#8217;t serve the entirety of the production as strongly as it should because everyone else seems to be mimicking his delivery; far too many lines of dialogue are whispered as if they have immeasurable significance to everything, and the end result of which the melodrama gets muddled in favor of the dramatic posturing of the players.Not good, Argento.  Not good.ARGENTO&#8217;S DRACULA (2013) (aka DRACULA 3D) is produced by Enrique Cerezo Producciones Cinematograficas S.A., Film Export Group, and Les Films de l&#8217;Astre.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group as part of the IFC Midnight series.  As for the technical specifications, the production has plenty of quality sights and sounds, but it&#8217;s all balanced out with some inexorably long takes; at 1:52:00, it feels at times closely to 5 hours &#8230; and that&#8217;s never a good thing.  If it&#8217;s special features you want, then there&#8217;s an impressive behind-the-scenes documentary (1 hr.), a music video, and a few theatrical trailers: a nice package, indeed, but enough about the ladies &#8230; (snicker snicker)(MODESTLY) RECOMMENDED.  Meh.  Argento purists (or is that &#8216;cultists&#8217;?) will probably be the only audience truly excited by this release.  The rest of us?  We&#8217;ll probably be left wondering what all the excitement is about.  I can appreciate even a good vampire story, and Argento&#8217;s obvious affection for the source material shines through; but so much of this DRACULA is down for the count.  (Get it?)  Argento&#8217;s signature non-blood-looking blood is everywhere &#8211; at one point looking like melted crayons while still at another like cheap wine &#8211; and the absolutely unnecessary (but appreciated!) emergence of ample bosoms can only sustain a man&#8217;s interest for so long.  Worth a view, but probably only one.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group and IFC Midnight provided me with an advance DVD copy of ARGENTO&#8217;S DRACULA by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
78651,I wish they had further seasons.  Disappointed when I can't finish watching the show to its conclusion.  Sometimes the streaming is so slow that it stops every 5 minutes.
78652,"i don't use it all that often, and i do have to be careful it's not left open and bumped cuz it is just plastic.  but i've had it installed for a couple years and it still works fine.  i don't use it much, very little actually, but it's def nice to have when you do need it.  it seems to be holding up real well to sun degradation, and i haven't broken it.  so for me it's been durable enough.  but even if ya have to replace it they're cheap.  i like it."
78653,"It's a great show, but I REALLY didn't like when they did away with Etta (Liv and Peter's daughter). That single thing really bummed me out, and well, even though they kind of make it better by the end, it's still not the same. Overall...GREAT acting! the best! And great writing (except for the daughter thing). I'd recommend it."
78654,"This whole season is a overlong, tedious remake of the movie. Anyone who would be interested in the series has already has already seen the far superior movie. It should have either done the movie in the pilot and given us new material from then on, or just started up after the incident at the bar in Mexico. It has that weird pacing and dialog of a Rodriguez/Tarentino movie, sort of: its too slow. You need to really be in the mood for this type of picture.I would not recommend this entire series as is. It is a great idea, has RR doing the directing, etc. but it doesn't click."
78655,"The chemistry of this makes sense for pansies...so we added this as instructed to our pansies...and they promptly died. Maybe it was just the time of year, maybe they were going to die anyway, maybe I just don't know what I'm doing. But it would only make sense that it was the pansy food that killed the pansies. Within days of application, they died."
78656,"I'll be honest, to my eyes, most mid to high end waxes shine about the same.  I'm skeptical of anyone who claims they can tell a dramatic difference in shine between various quality waxes.  Any small difference is going to be lost as soon as the car gets a little bit of dust on it, which if you park outside like I do will be a matter of hours.  So for me, the primary differentiator amongst high quality waxes is protection and longevity.  I want a wax that's going to protect my car's finish well, and do it for a long time before I need to put another coat on.I drive a Laguna blue S2000, which is a very dark shade of blue.  It shows scratches and swirls more readily than lighter colors.  I'm fairly obsessive about keeping it clean, but unfortunately do not have a garage and have to park outside.  I want a wax that protects my cars finish and lasts a long time.  So far, the Collinite 845 is working nicely.  After one month and two washes, the paint is still slick from the wax.  Most other waxes I have tried before would be wearing off by now, but the 845 is holding strong.I had read from others than 845 can be difficult to wipe off, but I didn't find that to be the case.  It went on very smoothly and came off fairly easy.  That said, when I waxed my car, it had no wax at all on the finish.  I would imagine that if there was already wax on there (and you were adding a second layer), then it would be significantly harder to wipe off.It is worth noting that this wax is a goopy semi-solid at room temperature.  If you get it warm, it will turn into a thick liquid.  The warm, thick liquid state is the ideal state to apply it to the car.  You will get better adhesion and bonding with the surface.Overall for the price, this is a great wax.  This bottle contains 10-15 applications on a medium sized vehicle."
78657,This pilot was awesome! I am dying for more!! Please continue with this series. It seems like a sure fire win!
78658,"As always, this show series delivers. Laughs as well as entertaining information about the world of Pawn Shops and the relics they buy, sell, and pawn. I learn something of interest with every episode."
78659,"I thought I was buying the 10 footer and realize I ordered the 5 footer too late.  Let's be honest here, what good is a 5 foot amp chord unless you're sitting on the amp?  My bad..I never would have ordered this as it costs the same money for the 10 footers as it does for the 5 footers.  I would not recommend buying a 5 footer unless you practice in a closet."
78660,"I had heard a lot of really good things, John Dies at the End is okay but for me did not live up to its press."
78661,Still entertaining after all the time it's been on television. I missed quite a few episodes and this is a good way to catch up.
78662,"This tuner works great. I put in a 9 volt battery a couple of months ago and it still is going strong. It will take a 9 volt output from my power supply and I can then piggyback to another pedal, which is great. It is very, very accurate and does not get confused under normal conditions. You do need to hit only one string at a time, however. Size is perfect for a pedalboard small but still quite readable. Price is very good. I had a Boss in the past but took it back because it just seemed so overpriced and too complicated."
78663,"In Short: Homicide detective relocates from Chicago to Florida after a quarrel with his old boss and bullet in his rear end. A settlement left him with enough money to buy a house, and that's about it. He finds a new place, on a new squad, in a new city. Friends and foes make an engaging and entertaining time.So, the reason I gave this 4 stars:1. There is just too much sex. It is implied everywhere and at every turn. I love seeing a little, but it was too heavy for my liking.2. The show didn't grab me. I watch it here and there, but nothing stood out. It failed to pull me in.3. The characters are great. Lots of wit and good rapport. The coroner is fantastic.I think it is one of the better of the crime dramas available, but it isn't my favorite. The best character on here, IMHO, is the coroner. He his hilarious.I think the television series ""Life"" is similar and I prefer it to this one."
78664,"This is a must if you own the Hi-Lift jack.  This makes using the jack so much easier in many cicumstances.  I bought it to go along with my 48"" Extreme model for my 2011 Polaris Ranger Crew and unfortunately 9I guess fortunately) I have not had the opportinuty to use this attachment on my own rig but have already had the chance to use it to help others!  I love it!"
78665,This series so far is nothing but exhibitions of gratuitous violence coupled with the machinations of an evil genius played by James Spader who week after week knows everything.  It all lacks any credibility.
78666,"I bought this EZ Air because of the reviews on Amazon.  Its a unique design, their web site says its patented. It has a Schrader valve on the gauge so you can fill a tire through it, so you can measure and fill at the same time, as an adjunct to any dedicated gauge on the air pump.Meiser can manufacture custom gauges with different logos or company names, so many look alike models sold under different names are very likely theirs.  The original one is cheapest, the custom named versions go as high as $30.Pros1. Check and fill tires simultaneously.  For typical consumer gauges, you'd have to fill tires then measure pressure as 2 separate steps, this is often because the gauges built into air compressors are not as accurate as stand alone gauges.  If you do this often, on say 4 car tires, it can be cumbersome.  If this EZ Air works as designed, it saves a step that adds up over time.2. Quick Connect Clip On Air Chuck.  Like pencil gauges, you press and get quick pressure read, but with the clip on, you can add air, check pressure, bleed pressure, and repeat as often, with less motion because the gauge remains connected to the tire.3. Flexible hose.  Allows you to position the chuck or yourself, to a more comfortable working position, and the hose swivels on this axis.4. Brass construction.  While the machining is a bit rough, its rare to see gauges of this type this cheap.  The chuck, hose, bleed valve assembly, and gauge assembly are screwed in, and the hoses have crimped connectors on them.  This means should the assembly get dirty by grease, dust or dirt, as is often in garages, it possible to do some DIY servicing to clean it out.  The bleeder valve assembly is hot glued shut, but it can be scraped out if needed.  Brass is good low cost material to make pressure gauges out off as its light weight, easy to clean, and doesn't rust.5. Rubber gauge guard, makes it easy to grasp the gauge.6. Accuracy. I compared EZ Air's readings with a digital gauge and 3 pencil gauges read on the tire by itself alone then on using EZ Air simultaneously through the air inlet port.  It was within &lt;1.5 psi compared to them.7. Numbers are easy to read compared to a smaller pencil gauge.Cons1. Clip on Air Chuck takes some skill to connect properly.  Many reviews complain it leaks or won't seat properly.  I found it will work ~100% of the time if you push it in to the tire valve firmly, before locking it in place; this is what the instructions say anyway.  If not connected well and you are filling the tire with air, it will hiss and leak, and confirms the problem.2. Air chuck is big.  The air chuck works well on tires without wheel covers, because the large air chuck may not fit the limited space where the valves stick out of the tire covers.3. If the air chuck doesn't sit completely, it will read low.  Make sure you push the chuck in firmly before engaging the lock.4. The air chuck has a floating brass valve that seals against a thick rubber gasket.  Since it floats, there is a tiny enough space that can pick up dust and dirt, causing it to leak, regardless of what you do.  Its easy enough to unscrew, blow out or wipe clean.I'd deduct a star because of the air chuck could make an error prone reading.  However it works so well once the technique is learned, and almost never leaks air when attaching to a tire compared to most gauges I've used, that's its pros overweight its con.A pencil gauge is far simpler and error free since if you hear the pencil gauge leak or hiss, you're not measuring the tire properly, with EZ Air, you can still connect it improperly without a leak.EZ Air is better when you think you'll fill the tire, rather than just reading its pressure.  Pencil gauges are smaller, have few parts that can go wrong, compact and dirt cheap, so its more practical as the go-to gauge for just checking pressure, rather than filling tires.  I buy them at Walmart for $2-3 each, check they are accurate for the pressure I need then leave 2 each in all my cars."
78667,"As MST3k is sort of a show within a show within a  movie format, it is good to look at each part as one part can ruin an entire episode.The movie: Even though this movie is from the 90's, it basically ignores all movie advancements since the 50's (like character development, plot, camera angles, lighting, etc.).  Yes this is the man-turns-into-monster plot (or in this case about five men who turn into five different monsters) that was already over used by 1956.  I at first thought they colorized ""Mad Monster"" until I realized that the actors in ""Mad Monster"" didn't have such strange accents.  So yes the movie is bad although the accents and the nonsensical soundtrack are funny enough to make it slightly watchable.Segments: The last two with Mike and Crow were hilarious.  I did like the how Pearl presented the movie with a one word introduction - about the same effort that the producers used to make it.Riffs: No outstanding stingers but a good job by Mike and the bots from start to end.  They of course have fun pointing out that the monster and one of the character's hair are different in every scene.Overall:  Not a classic but a very good episode."
78668,"This makes planting and growing virtual fail proof and very easy.  The seeds are in pods, and each pod is clearly marked as to the contents.  Simply prepare the planting area or pots (I prefer planting in containers as our dogs love to dig up most things planted in the ground), select the seed pod, remove the description tab covering the seed pod, plant the pod and water.The planted seeds came up in a few days and are growing nicely."
78669,I would recommend this series to anyone wanting a new series to watch to fill in free time and also introduces new characters from Canada.
78670,"As Season 2 opens, the Doctor has transformed into a new body, played by my favorite Doctor, David Tennant.  Rose is trying to adjust to the fact that the man who saved her life has a new body & the Doctor is needed before he's fully evolved, to defend London from mad Santa's & evil Christmas trees.  The Doctor/Rose bond has been well-established & Rose & her family help to defend the Doctor until he awakes fully renewed.  Lots of adventure & like Season 1, you have to love the Doctor!Great BBC series, with fantastic aliens, travel to far-away places in the Tardis, interesting problems & the companionship of Rose & the Doctor.  I recommend this series as one of the best!"
78671,(spoiler) I was riveted watching him as a woman. Amazing acting. Interesting and new characters. Wonderful. Catch wait to watch the next one.
78672,"Wow! I never even heard of this show, but I was looking for new show's to watch because all of my favorites are done for the season. I love this show because of it's originality and heart. It delivers action, love, friendship and the struggle to get back to where you belong. The actors are so seeped into their character's, one would think you where watching a documentary. I was intrigued from the first episode. I would highly recommend this show. Also, there are so many episodes in each season, that the price to watch this is very reasonable. Hope you enjoy :)"
78673,"I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned, but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form, but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two, but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously."
78674,"They work as well as any Dunlop pick; they don't crack, which is a big plus if you use the general Fender variety.  I go a little thicker than I would for regular plastic picks, because they get flimsy after a while.  Take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost - it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store."
78675,"To everyone who plays flat-picking guitar, I'm sure you all have your own choice of pick....do you even remember why you picked the style you use!? Somehow, I started out with Fender thins and here I remain!"
78676,"Bought this amp probably about two years ago. The amp has 3 levels of 8 presets each, for a total of 24 unique presets, ranging form heavy metal distortion sounds and reverberating clean tones. (The '65 Twin Reverb on the Orange Level is by far my favorite.) The amp includes gain, a volume and separate master volume knob in addition to bass and treble knobs. I feel like it is a bargain at any price. A great amp for practice and beginners."
78677,"Kudos to the History Channel and MGM for giving us a major, female character in Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick) who wasn't written off after the somewhat disappointing events beginning season two, whose strength isn't dependent on her male counterparts and whose dignity and courage rivals that of the central hero Ragnar.Besides being an exceptional historical drama, ""Vikings Season 2"" continues to engage both curiosity and imagination by defying predictability in either its character or story development and although we are given some foreshadowing in season one, it's impossible to say with certainty what'll happen along the way.  It's also worth mentioning that this series possesses some of the most well-choreographed battles (whether group of solo) I've watched either in television or film in recent years as well as an almost unprecedented treatment of the religious beliefs of the cultures being represented both sympathetically and within an historical context.I raise a flagon of mead to this well-written and mature drama that doesn't rely on ""adult"" situations or language to engender an atmosphere of uncompromising realism and that brings a welcome spotlight on a less than glamorous but equally fascinating period in European history.  :o)"
78678,Great show  enjoy the interaction with all the characters up with the times. Funny and witty for all and yet serious also.
78679,"Some might find this movie slow paced, but it is really very true to what we might have to go through in order to travel to nearby worlds in some future.The plot was provocative. And I actually found &#34;science&#34; in this science fiction plot.  There is good attention to camera angles and the direction is good.The premise is based on a probe that suggests the possibility of water under the ice of Europa.  A privately funded mission is created and six astronauts head off on a mission to see if life exists on the moon.  This takes place in our &#34;current&#34; or &#34;near future&#34; time.While en route, a solar storm knocks out the ship's communications, but the team decides to continue with the mission.When I watched this, I felt like I was watching the Moon landing all over again.  If you are tired of fantasy, science fiction, then you will like this movie.Nicely done."
78680,Really the best car duster out there in my opinion. Used others and they are cheap and fall apart easily. This one really gets the job done. Had it for almost two years now. Too bad I can't find where I put it :/
78681,"I know it's a lot cheaper to re-string your own spools but these are really convenient, and without the hassle of doing it on your own."
78682,"My wife and I are avid urban gardeners--we don't have a lot of green space, but what we do have we fill with herbs, vegetables, and flowers. This year we tried some vertical gardening to maximize what space we have.  The Seattle grow season is pretty short, so we usually do a combination of starters with seeds we sprout indoors.I was curious about this ""MiracleGro Salad and Herb Garden Kit."" We use MiracleGro products quite a bit in our garden, and it has become a ""name you can trust"" for home gardeners.  When it arrived, it was a pretty package, everything in its own little pod and visually appealing.  Planting them couldn't be easier--just pop the top and press the seed pod into the dirt. There is even a tape measure and instructions on how far apart to plant them.My main issue with this was the selection of seeds.  Not everything grows at the same time, and when I get a bunch of seeds in late July, that means all of the early spring crop like lettuce and snap peas can't be planted. The same with things with long harvest cycles, like the 75-day sweet pepper.  By late July, I don't have 75 days worth of sunlight left, so forget it.For review purposes, I have stuck all the pods in the ground or in containers, but I don't have high hopes for planting this late in the season. This is definitely a time-sensitive product, so be careful when you order.The other issue is the price--that's quite a lot to pay for seeds.  Sure, you get the little starting pods with all the good soil ready to go, and that makes things easier. But putting some garden soil in a pot and popping in some seeds have never been such a difficult process that I was hoping someone would make it easier for me.I could imagine this kit being worthwhile for someone who really doesn't know what they are doing--who has never planted a plant in their life and is looking for someone to take all of the guesswork out of it.  This could also be good for parents with children wanting to teach them about where food comes from, because the planting is so easy.  But a bunch of cheap packets of seeds would work just as well."
78683,"This is probably the best pedal purchase I have ever made.  I'm not familiar with more expensive compressors and how they might be noticeably better, but this one sounds exactly how I would expect a compressor to work.  It just makes things sound solid.  I've watched the wave envelope it puts out using Audacity and Adobe Audition and the compression works as advertised."
78684,Wow! An international crime thriller series produced in the U.S. How did that happen. This is an outstanding series. Highly recommend.
78685,"I agree with the other reviewers who state the unit is ugly.  the welds are bulky and uneven.  However, the welds seem stout and I am sure it will perform just fine.  After all, this is about as low-tech as you can get.  I will disagree with other reviewers who say the unit does not move/sway.  I have a 5/8&#34; pin in it and my bike rack moves pretty substantially.  I will be getting an adapter to remedy this problem.  Bottom line for me for this product was price.  I am overall pleased with Curt and this product."
78686,"This grill is new for 2013 and it was very easy to assemble. All the parts were in the box and there wasn't any damage. I cooked chicken and steak on it the first night and it worked Okay. I bought a aftermarket grill 2 years ago and it leaked grease all over my deck plus it didn't cook evenly and had hot and cold spots so I went back to a Weber because we could afford it this year. My last Weber lasted 10 years and I can't imagine why this one wouldn't do the same. The Stainless is heavy duty and I like that the propane tank is hidden behind the door and out of site. The small foot print is a plus but not the reason I bought the grill it's simply because there are only two of use now and serves our purpose. Update 5/18/13 I have cooked several times and the grill is not heating very well. The cross over tube flame is red not blue and cooking times have decreased. I called Weber and there going to send a new burner and we will see if it solved the problem. I will update when I replace the parts. Update 5/26/2013 I have installed the new burner tubes and had a party this weekend and it took over one hour to cook thin burgers. This is the worst grill I have ever owned. Weber is sending a rep to see if it can be fixed but at this point I just want them to do the right thing and take it back before the summer is over. Update 5/28/2013 Lowe's has a 90 day return policy so I took it back and ordered a Genesis S-310 three burner with 38,000 BTU. I have to wait two weeks for the order so I hope it's worth it."
78687,"Dracula is revived once more into the world of the 1800's by a desperate man who kills his own innocent guide in order to ""feed"" what appears to be a shrunken corpse. He then asks one favor of Dracula, to help him in his quest for revenge. It turns out the two ""men"" have the same group of enemies who go back to ancient times. Now, we find Dracula living in London, England trying to stop the powerful economic barons who are blood relatives of his ancient enimies. This is the same ""secret society"" that burned his first wife to death in Medieval times. To make the plot even more interesting, Dracula recognizes a lovely young English woman who looks exactly like his murdered wife. Now, he must hire her fiancee to keep her nearer to him. What will happen when Dracula tries to explain his re-emerging love for her? Is she really his wife returned to him as foretold in the old prophecy of reincarnation? Can Dracula first ""remove"" the evil ringleaders, who are finally convinced that their forefathers' enemy has returned, before they can trap and destroy Dracula and his comrades? An interesting twist on the famous old novel is having Dracula pose as a rich, young American businessman with a wonderful, new lighting invention which threatens the stranglehold his rivals have over the new gas-powered lighting industry. Who will live and who will die as even families and co-workers on both sides are threatened?"
78688,"This is one of the more campy and fun SciFi shows to come from the BBC. It has some of the same arch sense of humor that makes the Dr. Who series so beguiling, but with a slightly darker and more dangerous edge."
78689,"This is a high quality hose - I've had cheaper ones that have broken quickly.  Here in Arizona, hoses usually rot within a year or two (the intense heat and sun kills them), but I am cautiously optimistic about this one.  It works great - I can pick it up, extend to the areas I need to water, and then it all very neatly and tightly coils back together near my spigot.  I think the straight ends are KEY as the other coil hoses I've had didn't have this.  As some of the other reviewers noted, you cannot cover anywhere near 50' of distance with this hose due to the coils and the inability to stretch the hose out flat.  Mine works optimally in a 15-25' range and after that I need to hold one side of it with tension to allow the hose to stretch more, maybe to around 35' of range.  I'm very careful not to stretch the coils more than they are intended because when you do that, they can reverse on themselves and it makes untangling the hose a nightmare.  I'll update this review when the hose fails so if there's no additional note, it's still going strong!UPDATE:  4 months in and this hose is still going strong.  I am impressed with it's ability to recoil just as tightly as it was when I received it on day 1.  Looks great underneath my spigot.  I just ordered a 2nd one."
78690,"I'm English, so this show is special to me..I loved it, and they are true stories..a must watch if interested in history."
78691,"This solar powered tender and charger is considerably bigger than the picture suggests. At around 18&#34; around it may look at place on top of a shed or in the yard. Do take into account the size.But it's very well made and it was showing a charge even in doors. Unfortunately this brings up my biggest complaint. It comes with a cigarette adapter and clips but... No stock tender connector. This means in all likelihood you will have to expose the battery on a motorcycle and hook up directly. Perhaps theres a peripheral connector available but I haven't checked.So the unit works, it's priced right and does what it says on the box. Just shame they missed out the most important connector for bikers.  One star off for that but otherwise great!"
78692,"The previous season to this one was rough for fans of NYPD Blue.  Everyone knew Bobby Simone would be written out early in the season, as Jimy Smits had decided to move on.  This knowledge in no way made the slow, sad death of Bobby any easier to bear.  Then, shockingly, Andy's wife of several seasons, Sylvia, is gunned down before the season finale, adding to the list of tragedies heaped on his shoulders.  Maybe because of the heaviness of these episodes, Season 7 has an overall lighter tone, while keeping the gritty nature the show was always known for.  James Martinez exits the show after getting promoted to sergeant.  To fill his spot, the character of Baldwin Jones, who would remain until the series' end, is introduced.  Danny Sorenson has a relationship with fellow cop Mary Franco, but gradually gets closer to Diane.  Danny's self-destructive tendencies become more evident, foreshadowing his downfall by the end of Season 8.  Season 7 has some excellent episodes, and just like the rest of the seasons, benefits from incredibly high quality writing and acting.  This was a fantastic season of one of TV's truly great dramas."
78693,I purchasedLucas 10013 Fuel Treatment - 1 Gallonand a few smaller bottles of fuel treatmentLucas 10020 Fuel Treatment - 5.25 oz.along with this pump. So now I save money by buying in bulk and have the small bottles to refill to make it easy to leave in the car and put in my gas tank. True to form this thing pumps about 1oz a pump so 5 pumps and my bottles are full. The pump head has a place to hang the filler tube to prevent leaking.
78694,"The buzz around this film means that it is a must see for any serious `world cinema' fan, so I finally got to see it. I was not expecting too much, but was really impressed by this little gem from Norway. It is a dark fantasy told as a mockumentary from `found tapes. It tells of a group of students from Volda College, who have heard about an illegal bear hunter. They decide as part of their project that they will interview him and maybe even get some action shots.They track down Hans (played brilliantly by Norwegian comedian Otto Jespersen) who is less than willing to talk to him. He drives a customised Land Rover that is so beaten up it would get a Vehicle Rectification Notice if my local Constabulary saw it on the road. So the plucky youngsters decide that they will follow him when he goes out at night. What they run into is given away by the title of the film and Hans decides to let them film him and the Fairy Tale Troll hunts as he is sick of the job.What happens along the way is a story of how the group survive whilst tracking down rogue trolls. So is it any good? Well I absolutely loved it, it is done in chronological order as the tapes were found and is supposed to be a `rough cut', so it can jump around, but it adds to the authenticity of the thing that there are so many cuts. Obvious comparisons to `The Blair Witch Project' are fine, but this is way better than that. The special effects are good to amazing and the folklore around trolls is brilliant, we even get all the science as to why they either blow up or turn to stone when exposed to sunlight, and the whole blood of a Christian thing is thrown into the mix too. Add to that the over enthusiastic teen agers, a government conspiracy, some dodgy Polish Painters (Bear killers) and you have a whole smorgasbord of fun and action.Director Andr&eacute; vredal has done a brilliant job of getting the most from a relatively unknown cast, and has made a truly original film, So original in fact that Hollywood have already snapped up the remake rights, so see the original first. It is in Norwegian with great sub titles but also has an English dub alternative. Either one you choose this is a brilliant film that shows what a bit of imagination and some talent can do, highly recommended."

78696,"I ordered the Hola! and the Snark SN-6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church.  I've spent the last week or so tuning a large group of 20 or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to &#34;settle in&#34;.  I've used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent.  I can't really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one.  They are both contact tuners, meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone.The Hola! is definitely the best choice of the two in that it's more versatile, easier to use, more durable looking, and easier to store.  The Hola! lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark.  It comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need.  The Snark's curved display arm (which you can't really see in the photo) is slightly more delicate looking, in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther.  I found the Hola! display to be bigger, brighter and generally easier to read.  Honestly, most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are.  The really important difference is the &#34;tuning mode&#34; feature on the Hola!.Hola! offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its 4 modes of function.  You can select &#34;chromatic&#34;, &#34;guitar&#34;, &#34;bass&#34; and &#34;ukulele&#34; modes by briefly pressing the power button (as opposed to a long-press for power on/off).  This is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician.  Imagine trying to tune with a an 88-key piano if you don't know anything about the notes on the piano.  &#34;Ukulele&#34; mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes.  Use &#34;chromatic&#34; to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments.The snark *is* superior in it's rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction.  If turning your head *at all* is a deal-breaker, get the Snark.  I found the Hola!'s display to be more than sufficient.  I'm currently using the snark on my guitar."
78697,I love the accents and techniques they use to catch gators.  wish they would show more of the actual catch though.
78698,I really enjoyed Alpha House. I found the Senators hilarious. John Goodman makes the show &#34;ring&#34;. I'm looking forward to more episodes in the future. The John Goodman character has to be re-elected!!
78699,"Two of my wife's favorite hobbies are cooking and gardening, so she loves our new Miracle-Gro AeroGarden ULTRA with Gourmet Herb Seed Pod Kit.  The AeroGarden unit was very easy to assemble by following the illustrated instructions and didn't take much time either.  It can be placed on kitchen counters, as long as there is an electrical outlet available nearby.  However, it should not be placed under cabinet lights and an area of approximately 10&#34;x16&#34; is required.  The lamp height can be adjusted to the size of the plants, but requires an initial 16.&#34;  As to the seed pods, they are easy to plant by following the instructions on the LED screen panel.  The pods are labeled and indicate the height as short, medium or tall, so it's easy to decide where to place them.  The LED screen will time the necessary daily lighting after setup, as well as indicate when watering and feeding is needed.  There is a water fill port to do the latter.  Since I needed to rate the AeroGarden within 4 weeks, our herbs are not fully grown yet.  I will adjust my rating if needed on a later date.  The only reason I gave it only 4 stars, is because the bright lights can be a nuisance at night and the replacement pods, lights, and food can be expensive.  The latter taken into consideration, it is truly an efficient indoor garden if you want fresh herbs to cook with.  (Note - Other type of seed pods are available.)"
78700,This is a neat little tool and it has come in handy around the shop.  The red laser dot serves as a toy for my dog to chase around.
78701,"I liked this movie.  It moved along; the dialogue with crisp character definition.  I liked the way there was a clean beginning, middle and ending.  If this was made into a movie I would go to the theater to see it.  It needs a new title."
78702,It is so much fun to watch and see where Shonda Rhimes takes this show. To outlandish places and you do have to leave your logic behind sometimes (like believing that at least 3 people in the government have committed murder).  But it is great to watch and Kerry Washington is FABULOUS
78703,"Here's another low budget surprise by young British filmmaker Gareth Edwards.  Using a couple of young American (I think) actors nobody has heard of and guerrilla filmmaking, Edwards produces a terrific thriller.  A rich American woman is hurt in Mexico while vacationing prior to an upcoming wedding that we see she's not sure about.  After she is physically hurt, her father, a publishing tycoon, asks one of his photo journalists to get her home safe.  Why the big deal?  The Mexican/U.S. border has been walled off due to an invasion of alien creatures occupying the area.  They look similar to the spidery creatures from Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"", but they are rarely seen in the film.  What makes the movie different is that this is not a film about invasions and efforts to repel them.  They're here and while they are certainly dangerous, they seem more like wild animals.  They will fight, but only when threatened.  Again, the movie is not so much about the creatures as it is about the journey to get back to America.  Flying is out.  The creatures can fly (I think), but are usually grounded.  American jets are constantly attacking and spraying chemicals in the infected zone.  When the couple loses their passports, passage by ferry is also out, so they hire mercenaries to escort them.  Along the way, they fall for each other, but it takes the whole movie for them to act on their feelings.  The movie has depth, suspense and foreboding, but it really isn't a horror movie, it's a romantic journey."
78704,"Being a devoted follower of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series of novels, I approached this pilot with caution.  On the plus side, Connelly himself was involved in the adaptation as both a producer and co-writer, so I assumed it wasn't going to be as much of a travesty as, say, Tom Cruise's incarnation as JACK REACHER (Lee Child actually endorsed that one and did a cameo - go figure). The production values are decent, and Titus Welliver is, aside from the ridiculous sideburns, passable as Bosch.  I just prefer a little more charisma.  35 years ago, actors like Gene Hackman or Roy Scheider would have nailed the role in their sleep.  Beyond Welliver (and Scott Wilson in a small role), I have issues with the casting.  Jamie Hector totally fails to register as easy-going partner Jerry Edgar.  Anne Wersching, who was so magnetic on 24, is made up to look like Whistler's Mother when she first appears as beautiful rookie Julie Brasher, and hardly improves as the show progresses.  And I simply cannot buy Lance Reddick as Irvin Irving, Bosch's devious superior-cum-nemesis.  On top of all that, I found the direction listless.  The crucial shooting incident that lands Bosch in court was so indifferently staged that I was tempted to stop watching were it not for loyalty to the source material.  So, if this goes to series, I might check it out to see if it gets better, but it's definitely not on my must-watch list."
78705,"very nice bulbs - really crisp lighting at night - slightly smaller connection points, but were easily adapted by snugging up the connections in the light fixture in the car - strongly recommended!"
78706,"The lock it self looks like a quality built.  Heavy and shiny.  But sadly, it does not fit my 2004 Honda VTX1300c on either rotors."
78707,Well... its a stand..  its super cheap and i don't mean the price.  the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back.. i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back.  its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well.  Instructions were ok..  came with more parts than what were required... all holes filled and i have  of of each part extra.. the guitars do not sit very well in this stand... i will use it until i can find a better one.. it will get replaced.. i really should send this POS back to Amazon.  the concept is great but the execution of it sucks. it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand..  there are better options out there for something portable.  this stand is worth 10.00 tops... if i had it to do all over i would save my money.
78708,"Dont expect this to hold a full bottle of washer fluid! I'm using it as an Intercooler Sprayer & It's perfect for what I need it for, very easy to mount anywhere you like."
78709,"This is a review of Snowmen, since Amazon seems to be lumping all Christmas special reviews into one place.The Doctor travels back to Victorian London and encounters old friends, a new companion and an old foe.  Unlike most of the Christmas specials this one actually ties into the main plot of the season setting up the second half of season 7.Unfortunately this episode is not included in the Season 7 box sets so I had to buy it online for my set to make much sense.The Doctor, now retired from saving the world lives in seclusion in Victorian London resisting all attempts by Madame Vastra and her gang to get him going again.  But an army of killer snowmen and a fetching new companion change things.  It's a fun little story with some neat touches that really bring out the magic of Dr Who.  Our Victorian Samurai Lizardwoman and her crew steal the show more than once.  But that being said the threat is rather low (killer snowmen? even the Doctor scoffs at that) and our new companion doesn't really shine.So yeah, get it, I think the $2 online version is a better buy than the DVD. It's a fine entry but not really one of the great ones."
78710,"I had lower back disk fusion surgery 3 months ago. In my post-surgical state I have trouble bending and lifting heavy objects. But I can work the Toro Power Shovel! I bought it with low expectation, thinking that either it will not work well or that I will have trouble with it due to my current physical limitation. Surprisingly, neither concern materialized. Toro easily chopped through 10 inch snow bank left from 18 inches that fell a few days ago, and I was able to push it through the snow as well as move it up and down the stairs to the house. In some areas I was able to push it one handed which was an easier position on my back, and sometimes I needed the second hand to get through a tougher spot. The handle is adjustable so with the highest position I don't have to bend too much.Wet snow update:I am updating this review after the first wet snow. Toro power shovel handled it well! It was a little harder to push, but I found that I could brace the handle on my thigh and that allowed me to push with my leg rather than my injured back. Then it was easy!The hardest thing to deal was not the show shovel itself, but the 100 feet of electric cord, which was heavy, unwieldy and became almost unmanageable to coil back, especially when it became cold and covered with snow. The electric caddy was not much help, it was hard to control. Putting back the cord tired me out more than shoveling itself.I found that the Toro power shovel was stable without having to lean it against a wall when I put it a big plastic storage bin (see picture). This way when I bring the shovel in and the snow melts I will not have a puddle on the floor. The caddy with the electrical cord fit nicely on top of the shovel in the bucket (see picture).This product is build for a right-handed person.Update:I found a solution for an electric cord winding - it is called Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank:Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank Extension Cord WinderAli Julia review"

78714,"The fight choreography in this program is among the worst I've ever seen. These supposedly agile, strong, ferocious creatures can only stand around and growl menacingly at each other, with an occasional swipe of the claws. Unfortunately, our werewolves swipe a bit worse than the bad guys and usually collapse into a heap with a stern look. Our Asian martial artist will inevitably drop her weapon and collapse as well.Please....I know we have to put our heroes into peril, but can't we put at least some thought into making it intelligent peril and avoid making them look foolish and incompetent?"
78715,"The show is just plain old funny, and reminds me of how my family and I interact.  Everything is in good fun, there is a lot of honesty, when the jokes are coming, and it is not a show that I fear my children to watch."
78716,"I purchased this for my 2003 Silverado 1500.  As recommended, I also purchased the updated thermostat housing, as GM updated it for 04-05 models.  Everything went perfect with the installation, until I put the thermostat on.  I had the torque wrench set to 15 lbs (as required) and the first bolt's head broke off before even getting to the TQ. spec.  I then had to remove the part, go to a local part store and pickup a non-GM part.  Sad.  When I installed the waterpump this time, I reused the factory bolts.  Everything is fine now.Sad that I went threw the effort to by the GM Canadian part (as opposed to Chinese), only to find that they included some cheap bolts made of tin."

78718,"Why do pansies need more Nitrogen?  Don't blooming flowers need more Potassium?  I'll answer that!  Pansies need more Nitrogen (the first number in the three-number ratio) because they grow and bloom in cold weather.  When soil temps drop below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, Nitrogen from Nitrates is necessary in a pansy's diet.  When it is cold out pansies can &#34;digest&#34; Nitrogen in the form of Nitrates easier than other forms of Nitrogen.By the time I received my bag of pansy food, it was getting a little late in the season for pansies, but I hurried and got an application onto the beds.  I noticed an improvement in the bloom size and color vibrancy within a week and a half.  The grains are uniform in size (with no dust to blow away in the wind), some of them are slow release, and it was easy to work into the ground.I also liked that there were different application rates provided for beds, round pots and square pots:  Now, that's getting down to the nitty-gritty--and left no questions in my mind as to the exact amount to use.If you have any left over, be forewarned that it is not suitable for use on consumable (food production) plants.This fertilizer contains organic fertilizer in addition to more usual &#34;conventional&#34; fertilizer material:  Feather meal, meat and bone meal, kelp, diammonium phosphate, calcium nitrate, potassium sulfate, ferrous sulfate and manganese sulfate.It is not always easy to find fertilizer for blooming plants that contain Nitrate Nitrogen.  This GreenView Pansy Food has 3.4% of its 10% Nitrogen in the form of Nitrate Nitrogen.  And that is a good thing.During the warmer months--beginning sometime in March, depending on where you live--pansies can take on and thrive with less Nitrate Nitrogen and you can turn to a more balanced diet (ratio) of Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium, plus trace elements."

78720,I didn't like season 2 quite as well as season 1. I felt like it got progressively more violent instead of more interesting. Perhaps  that's to be expected as he becomes more and more involved in the lives of various citizens. Some of these families are like the Hatfields and McCoys; there is bad blood between them and you just know there is bound to be violence in the picture.
78721,"This is another of those indy films that is so good it is difficult to watch.  Fanning is a young girl on the verge of adolescence, who has that natural talent for singing that so many children lose.  She lives in a vivid rural milieu with a father who is a heavy drinker and an absent mother.  Her friends include a neighbor boy and a wonderfully lively group of southern blacks, whom she accompanies as an elvis singer.  It is warm and she is evidently going to become an extraordinary beauty.However, she is introduced to sex at too early an age.  This is not, as some reviewers have claimed, about early sexuality - there is nothing titillating about it whatsoever.  Indeed, completely unprepared, the theme of the story is that it nearly breaks her spirit.  It is about the possibility of healing and it is extremely, graphically realistic.  Fanning's performance was, in my opinion, oscar-worthy.Warmly recommended.  Just be prepared for stark realism."
78722,"Fit just right on my spare tire on my new Jeep Wrangler. Seems to be made well also! Good price for a well made, good fitting spare tire cover."
78723,"If you ever want to forget your own drama, this is a great show to watch. Makes you appreciate your own drama more. lolSo far I have watched the first four episodes and find Kyle to be an abusive person towards her sister and Camille. I feel sad for the way Kim is constantly treated. Like the grocery store. Kyle says you need real butter. Kim just grabs a tub of butter and this upsets Kyle because its not the gourmet kind. Kyle's little motto 'In a town full of phonies I am not afraid to be me' If that is true then who cares if its not some gourmet butter? She sounds like the biggest phony on the show. Always trying to impress not caring who she steps on. Constantly telling her sister 'you make bad choices of men' In front of people to boot. Where's your class Kyle? Show some respect for individuals privacy. She is constantly putting her sister down in front others. Wouldn't surprise me if she is an alcoholic. Since alcoholics are hard to please. And now she is attacking Camille. I am not a fan of Camille but I think she has been treated poorly by women and thus doesn't like hanging around them. So naturally someone with low self-esteem like Kyle will feel jealous and want to lash out. And I think Kyle is the most pretty one the show. I just think her attitude sux making her ugly.The only normal people I think on the show is Kim(a mom who is trying so hard to make a home for her kids and being verbally abused by the people around her), Lisa(unless she acts like Kyle), and Adrienne. I think Lisa and Adrienne have nothing to prove because they are independently rich and need no one. So they don't have to constantly worry about what butter their going to buy to impress their guests. So they get to be themselves. I think Kim is comfortable in who she is and this pisses her sister off(because Kyle is not comfortable in her own skin)causing her to lash out at her all the time. I really cry for Kim. She needs to find positive people who understand her. Not people who have nannies and pass their babies to their husbands and then try to offer advice on parenting. She needs women like herself who work hard at being a mom and love their children unconditionally. And let me tell you it is hard being a mom. Some of us moms would love a spa day.Money is the root of all evil and makes people do dumb things."
78724,I had no problem with these at all.  I guess i picked the correct polarity the first time because both lights worked after the first try.These are nice and bright and actually help me see through my tinted windows while backing up much more than the stock lights.
78725,"For more info on this show and the cast, Wikipedia has a very good article: Endgame (TV series).I enjoyed the series.  It is different and not the usual detective story.  The writing is smart, complicated, interresting and always with good heart.  The filming is creative and innovative - very good storytelling.  Not for everyone apparently, this Canadian show was canceled after only one season of 13 episodes."
78726,I'll re rate this item if my problem is fixed but maybe this is normal??  I have a Vox ac30hw2x and I put this jj 12ax7 into v1.  I have a significant volume/gain reduction now.  I know it's the tube because I can put the stock ruby back into v1 and the volume/gain is back.  I haven't checked yet but I'd say there is a 40-50% loss in volume.  I was thinking maybe this is a higher headroom tube?? It's not stamped to be one so that's why I'm confused.  Is it typical of JJ to have more headroom? I'm not digging this tube so far so back in goes the Ruby.
78727,"Looks good.  Great quality for such a low price.  Fits the instrument, (and old Mexican acoustic), and feels comfortable.  They arrived before the promised delivery date."
78728,Spray this on your wheels and let it set for 1 minute and it will work its magic and convert your old wheels to new wheels.
78729,It's not often that you see fully fleshed-out character-driven drama like this. Prepare to be surprised and delighted by this show.
78730,Put this on the lid of my trunk and it decreased the rattling from my subs big time. I have a hyundai Elantra and the trunk lid is absolute garbage. The aluminum is extremely thin and flexes like crazy. This little bit of dynamat made the whole trunk sound much more solid and reduced the flexing. I highly recommend it.I also recommend getting the dynamat roller if you don't have one.
78731,I love john goodman this series was made for him ! Cannot wait to see the new episodes ! Thank you for great programming !
78732,"This is a very good season, but I think things are slowing down a bit. They have done a better job in the past."
78733,Good show
78734,"Whoa, did not see that coming, no wonder his wife did not want to go to the gala..Shondra Rhimes if fricken brilliant."
78735,"This &#34;Neoprene Red Thermal Fleece Face Mask&#34; fits well on son's huge head and has made the seemingly never ending Winter somewhat more tolerable when he has to shovel the absurd amount of snow we were graced with this year. This did have a bit of a chemical smell, but it dissipated fairly quickly when left to air out on the front porch for a day or two.The mask fastens with Velcro and fits tightly around the chin and mouth but is a little loose above the nose, which can cause his glasses to fog up from his escaping breath. The mask does make a big difference in comfort and the bright red color is reassuring as it would be easy to see if should get accidentally trapped in one of the huge snow drifts that has accumulated in our yard.Recommended!CFH"
78736,I used this set of cleaning products to fix a scratch on our Samsung LCD.  It only took a few minutes and you really can't see the scratch anymore at all.The Novus 1 also works great on iPod/iPhone/iPad and anything like that.
78737,Storage 24 does a pretty good job of creating tension and suspense. The effects are decidedly on the low budget side. Plays like a well done SyFy movie.
78738,These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.For a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.
78739,"this is the standard OEM 9006 bulb... it's a warm white, very warm... maybe like 2700k-3000k.... these, while not having a white hot look, last a very long time in comparison to other 9006 bulbs I've used.... even other Philips brand bulbs don't last as long as this one....it's cheap and gives you a OEM like lifespan instead of having to change aftermarket 9006's every year when they burn out....I'm fine with the OEM look and not having the hassle .... so two thumbs up for this product"
78740,"we find this show interesting, rather exciting, fast paced, a novelty in the world of other shows involving lawyers, will continue with the series."
78741,Truly one of the best shows on TV.  Great law stuff but also great relationship stuff.Hope there will be many more seasons.
78742,Another great season of a great show. Really wish it wasn't over. What an entertaining show with such a diverse cast of characters. Gotta love it
78743,"I wanted Poulan brand oil, and this was the only place I could find it. More expensive but it works great. Nothing to compare it to, but I'm happy anyways."
78744,Hope it gets more seasonsKarl Urban is great but his partner is just as greatLove him would like to see him more
78745,"I was unimpressed with this trap.  I found it  to be somewhat difficult to put food in, had a very small opening for the mouse - so much so that unless they are very curious, I question whether or not they would enter, and the plastic latch which sets / locks the trap didn't do a good job of actually locking (I even had to throw out one of the traps after a short while b/c the latch wouldn't stay locked).Unfortunately, I currently have a problem with mice.  I have 4 different types of traps: (i) classic spring & wire snap traps from Victor and Tomcat, (ii) glue pads, (iii) Ortho Home Defense plastic traps similar to these, and (iv) these ones.  I find these to be the least effective and most difficult to set of the bunch.  They are, however, somewhat aesthetically inoffensive relative to some of the other types of traps available, and can be placed on the counter without it looking so blatantly like you have a mouse trap there.I would not recommend these, and instead choose another product.Pros:* Decent looking plastic which is relatively inoffensive looking.* Seems like if you did catch a mouse, you wouldn't have to see it afterwards and it would be trapped effectively in the plastic container.Cons:* Fairly large.  Also, for those who are environmentally conscious, it's definitely more ""product"" than an old fashioned wire and spring mouse trap.* The holes for putting food in are very small.* The plastic latch to set the trap didn't do a good job of locking, and on one of the traps I eventually just couldn't getit to happen after a while and I had to throw the trap out.* The mouse can't see / be enticed by the food b/c it's contained in the plastic container.* Small door for the mouse to go through to get to the food (which, however, is more than enough space for a mouse to fit through if they wanted to)* Once food goes in, it's really a pain to get it out, and things like peanut butter are hard to get in there."
78746,"No complaint so far, seems to be holding perfectly, and most importantly, it was dirt cheap compared to what Honda and Toyota want for a different colored paste that performs the same function."
78747,"This stuff is amazing this is my third bottle of this product and I have to say it is the best quick detailer, in between washes this product brings the mirror like shine right back to where it should be."
78748,Watching this once was once more than I should have.  Is this the way people live in California?  No way I would watch any more of this.  Wish some of the stuff that was Transparent would have been more opaque
78749,"I put these on the grill of a 1995 Ford pickup truck that we use frequently for various tasks.  The truck is still in fantastic shape with no rust and a paint job that looks almost as good as new.  I thought it deserved a special treat for keeping itself in such beautiful shape.  So, I gave it two new eyes to see with!  They do look very cool.  As the product description states, in daylight hours without headlights on, they operate at 100% power.  After dark, when the headlights are on, they diminish to 50%.  If they were installed on a newer car with headlights that stay on as soon as the car starts I don't know how that would work.  But, not my problem as I have no new cars!Fun thing to add to my truck, and not very difficult to install."
78750,"These screws fit my project guitar perfectly and considering it was an older Epiphone by Gibson S-900 that I opted to add a pick guard too, the screws fit everything perfectly. The look of the screws was even better than the cheap one you find on most import and low end made guitars the have the fat heads and strip really easy. I will purchase again for my next build."
78751,"Can't wait till I can get the next season! Love this show about friends from LA that move to Cleveland and the hilarious adventures. I'm around the same age as these women (not as beautiful) but can relate to some of their insecurities. Betty white character is a bonus! She is a hip, funny woman who brings the other four back to reality. This series is a must if you love slapstick comedies."
78752,"I will admit to some hesitation at even wanting to watch this show.I sit in Dialysis 2.5 hours a day 5 days a week. Sitting in Dialysis is hard, the recliner chairs are most uncomfortable having two 15 gage needles stuck in your arm is at best painful. Nor having anyone to talk to is the pits.what i did is bought (what was at the time) the only portable blu ray player on the market and started watching blu ray movies.i was told about Dexter by friends and everyone that told me about it loved t. ""it's about a cop that kills on the side"" they would tell me. after a few of them talked me sensless about it i thought i would try it.I loved it from the first show.Set in Miami, Dexter works for the police department figuring out how blood splatters from the victems of knife or gun shot wounds. but he has a darker side. he himself is a killer. his step father taught him how to channel his instincts and kill thoughs that are ""unworthy to live"".It;s dark, often funny, and very bloody. this is not recomended for those that can' stand people screaming and bleeding a lot. but it is for those that have a dark sense of humor"
78753,"I don't know what is more amazing the fact that Harry Crane is still working or that he is actually important that amazes me more.  This is a truly great show, it has gone through several cycles - much like life, but It always leaves you wanting more.  It is writing and production beyond compare.  I am writing this after the mid-season finale and am still in disbelief that it will be another year to see them again.  You have plenty of time to binge watch it from the beginning.  In fact it is the  best way to watch it  - unfortunately one day you will be caught up, and will be left like the rest of us with only 60 minutes sessions - and always wanting more!"
78754,"This amusing, well acted political satire by Gary Trudeau isn&#8217;t quite up to the level of the often brilliant &#8220;Tanner 88&#8221; he created with Robert Altman.  It lacks that earlier series&#8217; sharp edges and dark moments that made that now legendary show far more powerful and even painful between the chuckles.None-the-less, this tale of 4 likable if goofy Republican senators sharing a house in DC has a good number of laughs, and a larger number of slightly rueful smiles.  (Along with a trove of enjoyable supporting characters). And while Trudeau&#8217;s gently left leaning sympathies are clear, you can be sure he shows his Republican protagonists&#8217; likable, human sides, and isn&#8217;t afraid to make Democrats look just as opportunistic and small minded."
78755,"I don't know whether to side with those who brand Mr. Assange a traitor or with those who see him as a hero for his release of secret documents to the public. He received information from others so, although he was complicit by this act, he was following his instincts as a good information resource. The ethics of freedom of speech and the media, are subjects of serious debate and contention. Intelligent minds do disagree."
78756,A bit pricy but probably worth it because it works great and still looks like new after a dozen uses.........seems to be very compatible with the Weber SS grates.........don't know how it would do on Cast Iron but probably OK.
78757,"First time using this product, reading the reviews I knew it would work (once applied) but was worried that it might darken the plastic or leave smearing. It did not do this, it was super easy  to apply and went on without incident. It also did not leave any grease. It's expensive, but worth it."
78758,"I absolutely love Sonja and Marco. Add in Hank and Cooper and the very weird Linder, and it's a wonderful cast. The mix of Mexican and American culture/language is great! The backdrop of the missing girls of Juarez is spooky and real. It's great!"
78759,"Not that many good products/accessories for ukuleles.  This one is perfect in size and price.  However, you must be creative when attaching it to the headstock.  Just give it a little thought.  Overall it's fine."
78760,"Christian Slater has had a knack through his career of landing in too many so-so movies. It is nice to see at this stage of his career he turns in one of his best performances. The supporting cast is good with Mike O'Malley being especially interesting. The budget seems to be decent.Like the somewhat similar British series Jekyll the most interesting aspect of the series is the conflict between two apparently separate people inhabiting the same body. Edward, the Bond-like spy, is ruthless, and Henry, the family man, has never handled a gun. They do not seem to care much for each other but as they only have one body they find they must work together to stay alive. Everything was fine until Henry, previously unaware of Edward, discovers Edward's existance in the first episode. That they now switch back and forth at any moment is the tale.The last episode appeared to be working its way to a conclusion, but in the final two minutes they throw a curve. The show is good, worth watching on its own, but it would be nice to see a second season."
78761,"Cooler than Cool Hand Luke, with a quick draw you wouldn't believe and plots that remind you of the old, good stuff. Amazon: get that latest season on our prime membership ASAP!"
78762,"Brilliant solution to the strap button problem! The pointy end makes it quick and easy to get your strap over the button while the larger sized top will then hold the strap on so it won't slip off! Works as well as locking strap buttons did, for me."
78763,"Let me say first off . . . make sure you get the right kit . . . or the air filter won't fit.  This kit is for any mower with a Briggs & Stratton 3.5 to 6.5 QUANTUM Series engine.  The Quantum engines have a vertically mounted air filter unit on the forward right side of the engine, which utilizes a paper air filter element with an integral blue foam gasket, overall dimension 4.4"" x 5"" (B&S; part number 491588S, which is printed on the side of the paper filter media).OK, if you've got the right mower match, let me comment that this is a very nicely put together kit.  It all comes enclosed in a plastic container and contains everything you need for basic annual maintenance and storage.  Price is very competitive, especially if you add a little extra value considering the top of the container converts to a re-usable funnel and the body to a used oil catch can (or for me, a handy parts bin for new and old mower parts, or nuts & bolts, etc.).  The contents are name brand parts/products, not a collection of cheap compatibles.Included in the kit:  1. 20 oz bottle of SAE 30 Champion brand 4-cycle lawn mower motor oil.  2. Briggs & Stratton air filter for the Quantum engine. 3. Champion Copper Plus spark plug.  4. 2.5 oz bottle of Champion Fuel Stabilizer, enough to treat over 5 gallons of gasoline (in your storage can) and the fuel in your mower's tank.  As I mentioned, the container also provides a funnel and small parts bin.A good idea and a decent deal."
78764,"Chris Carter does it again. This is a really exciting show, and there are all kinds of interesting twists. I want to find out what is the link between these people, and what was the cause of the apparent world wide power outage. I will be watching with bated breath."
78765,This has worked well for me with one exception.  It must be removed from the hose in the winter.  If it freezes it cracks and will spray everywhere next time you use it.
78766,This Series is exceptional for a TV show.  The characters have depth and the story has one sitting on the edge of one's seat. I highly recommend this whole series of Covert Affairs.
78767,Love this thing. Cheap and cool looking. Just wish the rubber cover stayed on better. Not big enough of an issue to loose a star.
78768,This is a great cop show! The main character is quirky and fun. The co-stars play off the main character. I love this show
78769,"I installed a custom cone cold air intake. Used this to wrap around the piping to keep the heat out, my gas mileage went up only 1mpg but thats still something. Keeps the air cooler around the piping and can definitely feel a boost in acceleration. This keeps the heat out for sure."
78770,"tennessee saxe/fun to use... not going to be part of a blues band anytime soon.. Still, seems to be good quality..Of course Hohner has been around longer than me...."
78771,"I bought this for my wife's Miata because the typical windshield wiper does not have enough curvature to meet the curve of the Miata's windshield. It does a better job than most but still does not curve enough at the very end.Since we get little rain in Reno, I haven't been able to test how effective it is in wiping off the rain but I will update this review when I find out.12/29/12 Update: With little rain here I can say that it seems to work as well as any other wiper blade. Because of our hot dry climat, blades don't last very long in Reno before becoming stiff and unable to flip over, thus squeaking. This blade is still doing O.K."
78772,"This is a very nice cord that coils up nice and small (small enough to fit in a cable bag), and the right-angle connector means that the cord, as it comes out of the female end, isn't trying to pull itself out of the strain relief.  The pistol-grip handle is super easy to use, and alignment with the twist-lok socket on my trailer is quick, without having to check to see which tab aligns with which slot - just have the handle about 15 degrees from vertical, insert, then twist to vertical and to lock in place.  And, on my trailer, the included quick-connect locking ring is just right, making hook-up super easy.  Yes, it's a bit pricey, but I'm really happy with it.  Oh, and the bright yellow color makes it easy to see (duh!), so that I'm just a little bit less likely to trip over it."
78773,I want to go to their concert. There I admit it. That's how much I like this show. Its a nice break from the animation and my kids like to get up and dance.
78774,Hey america this is the dumbing down you demand. This show is complete trash. Just glorifies murder and cannibalism. Its not clever or unique and it is repulsive you will love it.
78775,"While not as good as the first 2 seasons, still a great piece of work. The actors are fun to watch, and the writing is phenomenal. The story line is so complex and so rich in depth. I had a very good idea where the story was going by the end of the second season. Wrong! Everything changed! Exciting, surprising, and smart, a truly high quality program. But I seriously recommend you start at the beginning."
78776,Good length and for the price you can't beat it. The large plastic piece near the end of the cable which attaches close to the battery makes for an inconvenient and tight fit. I had to finagle it a bit to get the top of the battery compartment to tighten down properly.
78777,"DOWNGRADE TO 1-O STAR AFTER RETURNING IT BACK TO BROOKMAYS, THE SELLER:I am really disappointed by the seller, BrookMays', ignorant responses to my return of the defective Cherbub Guitar Pickup, which picks up unwanted noise by the wire's own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup won't have the same issue.  After two weeks of the returned item was delivered, I didn't hear anything from the seller regarding the return, so I emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap.  Too bad, four days after the email had been sent, I only got the email of telling me the case# of the message I sent without any further response to my refund.  until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle, and I don't think it's worth to waste more time on it, despite the fact of wasting the time and money I spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs. Therefore, yesterday, I emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to AMAZON about the bad after-sale service I ever have before if I still haven't heard from the seller shorty.Today, I finally received the seller's response to my refund, the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims, ""it was not defective. All pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar. The feedback can be to to many other issues. I have issued the refund of $7.04.""  Obviously, the reply is unconvincing; although the feedback can be raised from varies issues, i have tried with another pickup to the same directions and setups, but it doesn't have such problems at all.  The fact is NOT ALL pickups get UNWANTED noise although I didn't try many pickups.  Cherub Guitar Pickup doesn't work as the product description to pickup the original tones of the instrument regardless the surrounding noises.  Moreover, the unwanted loud noise from its wire movements is really annoying, and there's no way to stop the wire movements while strumming. Indeed, I won't use it, and I don't want it to sit at my house as a useless property, so returning back to the seller may help to improve the issues it has.  However, the hassles I got from the seller is totally unexpected and it's NOT worth at all.By the way, I'm also unhappy about the refund of &7.04, I bought it for $8.79 along with AMAZON Free Shipping of the purchase of $25 or more.  To me, it is not the money of $1.75, but it's not fair to the buyer, who doesn't get the right service and quality from the purchase but only wastes the times and money on this matter. So if you really need a pickup for your instrument, I highly recommend you to spend few more dollars to get a much better and reliable one. Don't make the same mistake as I did to try this one because of the cheap price, in turn, you may get more hassles than you expect on such cheap merchandise.  I don't want that happens to anyone else, so I decided to tell you what I went through to keep you from the possible hassles before betting on it.2 STARS FOR THE 1ST REVIEW AFTER USING IT TWICE:I like the clip-on design, which is easy to use, so it is worth 2 stars; however, it doesn't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings.  Besides that, it also picks up loudly through the wire's own movements, not as the description ""regardless the surrounding noises.""  I have distressed from those unwanted loud noises.  One more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that I use, and I have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback. However, when I switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke. the amp doesn't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume, and the other pickup doesn't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either.  I don't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup I got ... I bought it because its cheap price (less than $9) & clip-on design, but, I can't accept the noises and I have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller. So, if you want to give it a try, you may bear in mind that the seller, BrookMays, doesn't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn't work properly as claimed description. Good Luck then!"
78778,"I have enjoyed the entire series. Great story line, good acting. Hard t believe so many murders happen in one town.  But I was still intrigued"
78779,"This movie is the example of why you should have a strong outline plot, it's seems pasted together to a degree. However the editor managed to actually come up with a story here. Giant creatures that look like  walking octopusses! are taking over parts of mexico and two people must travel through the infected zone to get back to the United States. That's the story although it was the editor and director who finally figured this out I guess. The effects look great though! Which shows even a low budget movie these days CAN look fantastic unlike the low budget movies of yesteryear who had no cgi effects. THat being said I am sure many people were not happy that the movie is all taking place in jungle territory and northern mexico is all desert and mountains! The movie was shot in Guatelmala which is all jungle. Ok, the acting is fine and these days you can make a fine movie with limited equipment. No giant screens to block sunlight and such but still having no script and no idea what you want is not the best way to make a movie. This however turned out to be a an ok low budget movie with really good special effects. Like I said ten years ago the effects at this budget would have been at a far different level.  The blu ray looks great and you get lots of extras too.  So I would say that if you rent this one you'll be happy enough with it. I think the one star reviewers would probably hate all the really old sci fi movies out there so ignore em."
78780,"great tool to have, makes the job much easier. the design is ergonomically right. the price is right also. it is made with quality workmanship"
78781,"At the base of the story is a group of teenagers oblivious to an obviously evil presence that demands their cooperation.  To get into that  is getting more difficult for me.  A sharp town sheriff is one moment sharp then repeatedly erratically gullible.  A smart man accused of murder is holding a gun on the murderer and doesn't mention to the sheriff who is present that the murderer fired the gun which can be proved with a paraffin test (used by police for at least 100 years).  Even so, I'll watch at least one more episode."
78782,"I'm not sure if it just covers up smoke smell or eliminates it. I put this in my car that I smoke in, and it does seem to eliminate the odor, but not permanently.It kind of smells like fresh laundry or febreeze. It's a fresh, clean scent. I like it, and I would probably buy this product again."
78783,"This is one of my favorite feeders, because it's right there in front of your nose! Hummingbirds are very fast. I've gone entire years only seeing one sighting that year because I wasn't sitting by the feeder when they happened to come by. By sticking the feeder where it is always visible, that little movement will catch your eye, and you'll probably see them daily! I know I do!Because it's made of glass, and not plastic like the normal seed-feeders, it is on the heavy side and needs to be attached securely. I read some reviews where people had trouble connecting it. I found it quite easy, just clean the glass, oil the cups a bit and press. It's stayed up for years without any problem.I also read some reviews where people said they had trouble filling it. Just about EVERY hummingbird feeder I have has a small exit area - otherwise the nectar wouldn't come out slowly! A funnel is 39 cents and makes filling *very* easy.I have 10+ hummingbird feeders and this is by far the best for consistant hummingbird viewing."
78784,"What an incredble series!  Very well written.  Never knew what would happen next.  Extremely intense and you will be ""hooked"" after the 1st episode.  Anxiously awaiting season 2!!"
78785,Good size and deep enough to grab a lot.  That's what you want and that's what you get.  Built rugged and think will hold up to hot sun and pool chemicals
78786,Easy installation and good wiping. No complaints thus far.  Will update in a few months to report on how it held up.
78787,Quick and easy to install.  Keeps the wasps and mud dobbers out of the vents.
78788,I loved this series and am sad to see it end. This season wasn't as top notch as past seasons but still highly enjoyable! If you are a fan you definitely should follow it to the end and then sadly say goodbye:(.
78789,Our entire family enjoys watching this show together and my kids are more eager to try new foods as a result.
78790,Plot /storyline predictable. Loner pushed toooo far and then bang! I had nothing to do and picked this movie. I enjoyed Mr. Hauler's other works but here he is just going through the paces....The excess blood just made the movie ludicrous. I would not rerun it nor recommend to anyone!Video quality was perfect!
78791,"If you have a trailer, spend the money and get this.  Even if you think you're fine without one, get one.  It helps with gas mileage, keeps your front tires on the ground, keeps the trailer from swaying like crazy when passing large vehicles. It makes towing so much safer."
78792,"Never went into maintain mode after two days.  Always charging and that's when I tested with a VTVM.  The battery, fully charged from use of the car, started at 13.5 VDC.  Took the charger off when the voltage, at the battery, reached 14.75 VDC and was still rising.  Looks nice but this one appears to be malfuncting.  Returning to Amazon."
78793,"I've never, ever had any mice problems before, then really late one night I heard it.  Chewing, gnawing from the inside of the wall, trying to get into my pantry.  It sounded huge!  I thought that it must be an opossum or a squirrel, maybe even a RAT!  I am putting it mildly to say that I was more than a little freaked out (I am a city boy after all and a non-hunter).  He must have found another way in earlier because I found some ""pellets"" that were kindly left as evidence of a previous visit.  I took them to my local hardware store (in a thick plastic bag of course) and asked the kind man to help me.  He took one look and said, ""You got a mouse.""  I was just a little disappointed and left with a traditional spring and wood type trap.Loaded with peanut butter (apparently mice have moved on from cheese) I set the trap in the pantry and waited.  At about 2 in the morning I heard a frightening ""SNAP"" followed by some thumping. Armed with a flashlight I went to investigate.  Just to give you some reference, I am 6'3"" and over 220 pounds, still, this mouse was HUGH!  A Texas mouse, to be sure.  Unfortunately he was not dead but was mortally wounded and flopping around.  After he died I was left to clean up the body, blood and... other stuff.  This was a few months ago and I remember thinking, ""There has got to be a better way.""When I got the opportunity to try Victor's Kill & Seal Mouse Trap I went for it.  I was promised a clean and cringe-free way to dispatch and dispose of the little critters.  Mine must have been a pioneer, some brave mouse exploring new, un-moused territory because I have never seen or heard one since.  However, my neighbor recently complained that she has some unwelcome visitors of the 'Mus musculus' (that's their Latin name) type.  A chance to try this new gadget couldn't be passed up.Setting up the Victor's Kill & Seal Mouse Trap was fairly easy.  There is a little plug that you unscrew in order the bait the trap with peanut butter (again!) and a big lever that sets the trap and a trap door which promises to seal the little feller inside, allowing the proud human to simply toss the whole thing in the garbage.  Seems like a lot of plastic for one mouse, but at least I don't have to see it's quivering body.  We set it up in a likely spot and waited.  Two days went by without the trap being triggered so I checked it out.  The peanut butter was gone but the trap was still open.  We reloaded it (this time with a name-brand, organic peanut butter) and set it out again.  I got a call around midnight and was asked, no, commanded to come over, NOW!Well, it caught the mouse alright, but he was still in flopping and shaking when I got there and a good part of his hind quarters were sticking out of the trap.  I later looked at the diagram of the trap on the box and although our Texas mice are big, I don't see how he could have triggered the ""Kill Bar"" and still leave his back-side out.  Eventually he passed on and I (being the man that I am) disposed of the mouse, apparatus and all.  So, in conclusion:  is this better that the regular mouse trap? Yes.  Is it worth the money?  I guess that it depends on how squeamish you are and how many mice you have to get rid of.  3 Stars."
78794,My almost 3 yo granddaughter every now and again orders new episodes :) try to be angry with an adorable little red head. These programs are her favorites and super interactive and educational!  I don't even mind watching a few.
78795,The extension cable plugs easily into the Battery tender devices adding a little more distance between your item to be charged and the electrical receptacle.  Nothing more can be said other than the product works just as it should.
78796,"If you own a swimming pool I think it's important to own a Floating Chlorine Dispenser.  It's a great place to keep your chlorine tablets.Plus, whenever you head out of town there's a greater chance you will come home to a better-looking pool if you choose to put two or three chlorine tablets in this floater.  As you know, chlorine is important for swimming pool water.  Putting chlorine tablets inside this floater will make the pool water clean and safe.However, I recommend you tie the floater to the side of the pool instead of letting it float around.  That's because, if the pool is running, the floater might get stuck in the filter.  Always make sure the chlorine floater is tied to the side, away from the filter."
78797,"I was really excited to see this show.  I have followed James Spader's career for decades.  He is absolutely brilliant, and the clever and exciting scripts give him lots to work with.  Watching as subtle expressions play across his face communicating a depth of thoughts, feelings, and emotions is acting at its very finest. The supporting cast - including Diego Klattehoff, Harry Lennix and Parminder Nagra are all wonderful.But there's one BIG problem with this show.  Megan Boone can't act.  At all.  Not even a little bit.  Every single time she's on camera, which is most of the show, she is wearing the same dull eyed, vacant expression.  I realize her character is supposed to be understated, but this woman simply looks stoned or in shock ALL THE TIME.  I keep trying to watch and enjoy the juicy plots, and excellent performances by everyone else in the cast, but Ms. Boone's completely wooden ""performance""-if you can call it a performance - is a huge spoiler for me.  I find myself trying to imagine Clare Danes, Jodi Foster, Julianne Moore, Gillian Anderson, and others who have played similar roles and how much they could do with the same character.Please, producers of Blacklist, either give Megan Boone a crash course in acting, or replace her with someone else before her dead-eyed monotony causes an otherwise outstanding show to go down in flames."
78798,Love it. I makes airing down tires easy and accurate. Give you alot of control when airing down tires. The gauge helps so you dont have to let out the air and then check it with a separate gauge.
78799,I have throughly enjoyed the series The Americans. I hope they will continue to write similar episode's in the near future.
78800,"I love feeding the birds, and especially appreciate feeding hummers since here in New England we only get one species that comes this far north.  And then only in summer.  I have another hanging feeder in the yard that can be viewed from the back deck, but not easily from any windows.  This little jewel fits nicely on the window with the suction cups provided, and so far its been a success with the hummers finding and feeding off it.  I really like it a lot and plan on buying a second one for another window. As for some other observations, there is no doubt that this feeder is pricey for what you get.  You can buy a lot bigger ones that are not window models for less.  But a look around Amazon at other hummer window feeders shows me that you are getting no more soaked with this Aspects model than you are with any other.  As for the suction cups, they could be better but so far I have had no problems with them keeping it up.  (Press on them daily, and reapply on a clean surface when you clean it is a good idea).  Lastly, one thing that plaques all hummer feeders is ants.  Some of us more fortunate don't have as much of a problem with ants as others for whatever reason.  But if you are one to have an ant problem, (yes I am one of them), just keep in mind that this baby has a great little moat built into it that keeps the little buggers at bay very nicely.  It's not very big or deep so you have to check it often in hot weather, but if there is any water in it at all the ants can't get across it. Love that feature. A really nice feeder that is well thought out and sturdy enough to last for quite a few seasons to come... Enjoy  : )"
78801,"I came into the show via Amazon Prime-- didn't even know it was currently on TV. There are good crime scenes, fun stuff with time-travel sub plots and plenty of suspense. Even if you decide to catch up online, it's really with it."
78802,"I've had a few of the Perky Pet feeders over the years, a few of the plastic, a few of the glass - and they all have their pro's and con's.  Aesthetically, I still prefer thePerky-Pet 8120-2 Green Antique Bottle Hummingbird Feederseries, but the birds in my area don't seem too attracted to the color (although Perky Pet does offer blue and red versions which might do a better job). The glass bottles just seem to have a little bit of visual impact that allow it to act sort of as a decoration and not just a feeder. These giant 48oz feeders don't try and hide their function - they very boldly proclaim that they are hummingbird feeders.The feeder doesn't really include any useful assembly instructions, but that's not too big a deal as putting it together is pretty elementary. The large reservoir is easy to clean, but you do need a brush (or a really small hand) to get to the very bottom. The perches are very finicky and feel delicate - I'm not really sure how long they'll last. The plastic is also a big question mark. I live in sun country in the middle of Texas, and the harsh sun likes to take out its aggression on plastic. Previous plastic feeders have often cracked or discolored within just a couple of seasons.Another thing to keep in mind, although the large size is nice, unless you're feeding a giant swarm of birds, the nectar will probably ""go bad"" before the birds get to drink it all. In my hot climate, the sugar water molds up within a couple of days or less.All-in-all, I think my next feeder will probably be another glass + metal, but the brilliant red coloration and significant nectar size do make this particular feeder stand out. As long as the plastic parts make an attempt at lasting more than a single season, I'll be pretty happy overall. I do wish some of the perches felt a bit more sturdy though."
78803,"Characters are good.  Plot is good.  There is everything to like, especially when you like spooky stories.  Hope to see more of this one."
78804,"I've always been a fan of microfiber cloths for cleaning, but the Toddy takes it to a new level.  This is an ultra-microfiber that is soft, lint-free, and seemed to absorb those smudgy fingerprints on my iPad almost instantaneously.  The silk-like patterned side is rather slick so when I went to clean my iPad I simply folded it in thirds.  The pattern, which almost looks like a walkway, is set against a dark brown background.  The Toddy logo is in the upper left-hand corner.The Toddys are perfect to keep on hand to clean everything from your glasses to your computer screen.  I especially like to use this Toddy on my iPad and my glasses as those tend to need the most cleaning.  As far as cameras go, the blue mircro fiber can ""camouflage"" a bit of grit.  If you have an expensive camera, you may wish to haveKimwipeson hand instead.  I did however, find this Toddy especially useful for cleaning the camera itself and my numerous black battery packs which tend to be print magnets.I did wash my Toddy and dried it on low heat.  Anyone who uses a lot of microfiber cloths for cleaning will warn you not to use any fabric softeners, including dryer sheets.  The Toddy came out of the dryer as good as new and continues to clean just as nicely as it did when I removed it from its box.  It does have ""antimicrobial protection to prevent the buildup of mold & mildew,"" but I don't think I'll have that issue because it's not necessary to use any other cleaning products such as Windex with it.  Great little accessory to have on hand and I love it.Sample provided for review."
78805,"This was easy to set up.  It attracted birds almost immediately after we placed it on a tree limb.  It also attracts squirrels.  It is fascinating to watch the squirrels hang from their tails and do other contortions to get to the seed.  If it weren't for them eating or knocking out the seed onto the ground it would be a fun show.We have watched birds wait patiently on higher branches as others eat and fly off.  And there are so many colorful ones.The only issue we have with this and it is really a minor issue .. is that the water portion seems a waste.  We have not seen any bird or squirrel taking a drink.  Perhaps if the weather were hot for days with no rain that would be different.  We are toying with adding seed to both containers.This is a first-rate product and has brought us new found visitors to our back yard.  Easy to set up, easy to refill and definitely attractive to winged friends and bushy tailed ones too.Enjoy the chirps as they share the wealth with their flying friends."
78806,"I've been looking for a good tire cleaner since Meguiars discontinued making an aerosol tire cleaner. I gave this a try and I love it. I still use a brush to really work it in and it gets all the old tire shine off and you get a really nice all natural rubber finish. It also did a great job with the rims. Again I always use a brush to get into the nooks and crannies.Overall I love it, will buy more, but like others have said it doesn't go far. I have about 1/3 left after doing two cars. They really need to make a bulk jug so I can just refill the applicator bottle. Since I scrub the tires anyway I may adjust the amount I use. I went pretty heavy since it was the first time using it."
78807,"Conditioner works well but disappears into the leather fairly quickly, the cleaner requires some work and not sure about how valuable"
78808,They do the job of lighting your music up and they are easy to clip onto your music stand. The switches on the lamps however are a bit flakey.
78809,"After reading the mixed reviews, I hesitated, but now, I'm glad that I bought this inverter for emergency use in case of power outage during storms. It works great. I'm using a 12-volt battery to power it, which I charge with a solar panel. So far, I tested it with lamps, USB lights, a laptop and charging my cell phone. I'm getting a second one, and I recommend it for sure."
78810,"For the most part, hoses are ugly - especially the bright green ones.  However, this hose offers a stylish alternative to the standard garden hose.  It's black color means that it basically blends in rather than screaming out that it's a hose.  There's also no need to roll it - it doesn't kink.  Overall, it's great for watering flower beds, but it isn't designed to handle demanding watering projects."
78811,"I had no problem installing the software or hardware. I previously had a ""Generic"" Unit, this one blows it away. All the scantool.net software detects this as a ""Real"" Scantool.net tool.Note: I installed this on a Toshiba Netbook with no problem."
78812,"This air station started paying for itself from the first use.  With gas stations charging 50 cents and more for air these days, this is very nice to have on hand.  Here are some things to keep in mind when using.1. You need an extension cord.  The unit's cord is way to small to reach around cars.2. This has a small piston so it will take time to fill car/truck tires. Bicycle tires fill faster.3. Invest in a good tire gauge.  There are a lot of good digital or dial gauges that are very accurate.  The station has a gauge on top that can be set to what pressure is needed but it isn't completely accurate.4. The pumping noise is what should be expected from this small inflator.  I have a 12-volt inflator that sounds like a high-pitched mini jet engine so this B&D; is quiet in comparison.5.  The valve adaptor is hard plastic but has not been a problem.  It would be nice if they would have used brass but then the price would probably be higher.The air station works on AC or DC current and comes with car adaptor, ball needle and extension nozzle.  At $50 it is hard to go wrong here.  If treated right, this little air station will last a long time and pay for itself.  Well worth adding to the garage for car, truck, bicycle tires and all those sports balls."
78813,"i have had cats or my entire life and have actually learned more than a few things from this show and its host, a musician by night and a at behaviorist by day! This is more than just intuitive stuff, it treats cats as the predators that they are, and teaches you about their inner life. One of my favorites on Discovery."
78814,"This is an attractive addition to a country kitchen or any sunny windowsill that is wide enough. The planter is narrow and seems steady, so it wouldn't need much space. The wooden boxes come lined with plastic liners that will probably last a year if you plant directly into them. I imagine you can find some system for protecting the wooden boxes once the plastic liners wear out, but it would be nice if the manufacturer offered refill liner sets."
78815,"Musician's Gear Tubular Guitar Stand Black Pair is a good deal for musician. Buy it, if you would like to have your guitars ready to play anytime you want to."
78816,We actually cut off the narrowest knife slot (with a table saw) to make the rack fit in our cabinet. Works perfectly and no one has to know we altered the size :)
78817,This was easy to install and works great!  Make sure you match up both sides or you will have issues when trying to latch it.
78818,Works great for picking up light dust and dirt to give your car a quick spiff-up.
78819,I love this version of Pride and Prejudice. To me Colin Firth is Mr Darcy and I could watch it every week.
78820,I purchased all the seasons before I saw 1 was on Prime. They used to be streaming on Netflix & then went away. My daughter loves this show. She does the dancey dance & Biz's beat of the day. She's obsessed.
78821,"...is a must if you have any of the Danelectro/FAB pedals.  As anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat 9-volts like candy, this is the solution.  You get one of these and hook it up to a power splitter (Search for Visual Sound One Spot Multi-Plug 5 Cable) and you are good to go for up to 5 pedals!  No more battery swaps, no more searching for a 9-volt every 5 minutes..."
78822,Bought one for my new house.  I dont have a pool guy so I scrub the pool every other week or so myself.  It has been sitting outside in the AZ sun for all summer and all winter and still going strong.
78823,"Snark tuners are great. Since I've bought Snark tuners, they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way. I've had some for years that I still use today without ever changing batteries or anything. They are great and last forever. This one is also super accurate and allows you to really fine-tune your instrument. It have a vibration and mic sensor, so it can be attached to the instrument or set aside played in to to get a reading on the pitch that is being played. Really nice piece of equipment for a small price."
78824,"Dont waste your time with this one.  I kept waiting for the thing to get better....to give us a hint on whats going on .....whats causing all of the turmoil.  And then at the very end of the first episode, you more or less are given a big hint....disappointing."
78825,"I bought one of these used that was just like new when I got it.  The craftsmanship is amazing as is the sound quality of this little ukulele.  The build quality, the Aquila strings, and the tuning keys are very high quality.  You can sound great with one of these little instruments in no time.  I downloaded a Lanikai booklet off the internet and was on my way.  It is pure fun to play one of these ukuleles.I bought this for my granddaughter and would suggest a larger model for any adult with larger fingers. Some of the chords are hard to form due to the small size of the frets.  I am still stoked at playing this until my granddaughter takes over on this one."
78826,"These Danelectro pedals are great quality for the money. I use this pedal behind my dirt pedals for added flexibility and bringing out some more ""brilliance"" to the tone. The case is plastic, not very attractive, and perhaps not very sturdy. Also the button to push down for the effect leaves a bit to be desired -- it doesn't feel very solid. But I intend to use this more for recording than live use, so I'm not worried about that. Anyway, there aren't many EQ's on the market, and for the price, it can't be beat. I would recommend it."
78827,I I like my brothers did to that was a very very very good show... All Kids like to show that ...is a very very very good show.
78828,"Spray-On Car Wash KitWhile the idea of a waterless spray-on car wash is a great one, especially for situations where you can't use water, it isn't an ideal solution. It is below freezing in the winter here in Michigan, and I just cleaned the outside of my car with the Griot's solution and wiped it off. I found that I needed to use a lot more than 3 towels to cover the car and avoid smearing grit over the clearcoat. In addition, the Griot's car wash was starting to freeze before it dried. Even indoors, I noticed that the car wash did not dry very quickly.After wiping down the car exterior, it left the surface somewhat slick to the touch and with a coconut-like scent. However, it left smears and smudges all over the place. I had to buff it off with more clean microfiber towels. Honestly, if I had to go through all this trouble in the freezing temperatures, I'd rather just go through a car wash. That said, the Griot's car wash did cut through road salt quite well but it had a hard time on other grime like bugs, bird poop, and dried leaves.The saving graces in this kit include the microfiber towels, which feel a lot softer and finer than the typical microfiber towels I'd find in stores, and the wonderful sprayer and bottle. What I used to do in the past was pour in some car wash detergent in a spray bottle and mix with water. I'd use that for cleaning certain parts of a car in the summer. For instance, bird poop struck a part of the car. I'd use the sprayer and some paper towels to remove the acidic poop. I could see the Griot's Spray-on Car wash excelling in this department, but it would be far less expensive and just as effective to use a mix of water and car wash/wax detergent.As much as I like this kit and the Griot's brand, I honestly don't see the benefit to using this type of car wash kit. I'd recommend at least 5-6 towels at hand, and pray that none of them trap any grit that could scratch the clearcoat. My normal method of washing cars is using a bucket with a grit guard, chenille wash pad, and a hose of running water. The chenille cotton doesn't trap dirt at the surface of the nap and does a much better job of cleaning, while the grit guard ensures grit sinks to the bottom.Overall: 4/5 stars, not an ideal solution for washing cars. The sprayer and bottle are fantastic, and it is a great way to spot clean certain parts of the car. It is easy to use, but still freezes very easily in cold weather. Lots of towels are required for an entire car. I used half the bottle for just 4 door panels on my full-sized sedan."
78829,I used this on a car put in storage for many months. It started up with no problem. Now I use it in my lawn mower gas year round. I put it in the 2.5 gallon gas can and don't have to worry during the winter.
78830,"This is a very versatile tuner!  I use it all the time to check my instruments, and keep things sounding good.  Highly recommend this product."
78831,"Abby is an absolute egotistical monster and sooooo very entertaining. I think the dancing is okay. It's little girls. Not my cup of tea although I admire their efforts and toughness.

78833,"I just finished watching &#34;Hawking&#34; the film, and I've been reading his book &#34;A Brief History of Time&#34; on and off for the last month.  And back in the 70s and early 80s, I was a big fan of Carl Sagan.  Like I've said before, he was able to take complex subjects and break them down into simple ideas for &#34;simple&#34; people.I will admit that I'm not as big of a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson as I was of Mr. Sagan; to say otherwise would be insincere.  But nonetheless, I am a fan of Mr. Tyson, and I believe that he himself might even agree with me.  After all, at the end of the first episode, he discusses meeting Mr. Sagan while this new host was only in high school, and how Mr. Sagan was such a big influence on him in so many ways.  That ending was actually quite touching, and you could see in Mr. Tyson's eyes how sincere he really is about this.Right out of the gate, I will discuss what I believe might be a misstep in this reboot.  If you don't want to read anything negative, I would recommend stop reading.  You've been warned.Back when Mr. Sagan was involved in the first version of this series, he did a very smart thing:  while he may have discussed religion to a point, he mostly avoided the subject.  I think that that was a very smart idea.  Whenever you make an argument, if you have a worthy opponent, it is best to immediately attack that opponent's expected rebuttal -- with logical reasoning -- and attempt to show evidence that it is incorrect.  But if your opponent has an almost unarguable position -- mostly the religious, since they have no real evidence either way -- your best position is strictly to ignore him.  This is what Mr. Sagan did, even with the rest of his life.  He basically argued that he was agnostic, and he stuck with it, and then he moved on with science as he should have and just mostly ignored religion.Here, Mr. Tyson brings up the Catholic Church and the Inquisition, which is very interesting from a historical perspective.  But from a Science perspective, it really has no meaning.  After all, the Catholics were proven wrong, and they continue to prove themselves wrong as time goes on.  I believe that the implied meaning from Mr. Tyson goes as follows:  &#34;Science was on one side, religion was on another, and religion let you down before.  If you continue to follow them they will let you down again.&#34;Fair enough, but if that is the implied argument, it is probably invalid.  Times have changed, and even antiquated religions such as the Catholics have changed their opinion over time.  But I just felt that, in episode one, Mr. Tyson spent too much time in the episode trying to fight a war that's already been won.Now, on the plus side, the special effects and the graphics are way superior to the original episodes with Mr. Sagan, as is to be expected.  After all, we're 30 to 40 years now in the future, and so you would expect better special effects.  And I loved the way that Mr. Tyson stepped onto a virtual calendar, showing a linear transformation between all of time in our Universe versus one Earth year.  That really hit home how man has been on earth for such an incredibly short period of time versus the existence of time itself.  (Read Mr. Hawking's book, where he argues that &#34;time&#34; did not exist at all before the Big Bang Theory.  While it is difficult to grasp from an intuitive perspective, it is eye opening.  &#34;Time&#34; has no meaning if the Universe does not exist.)So, what would Carl Sagan do?  I believe that, if he came back today, and spoke with Mr. Tyson, he might just recommend to his old friend and student, &#34;Stick with the Science.  Let religion prove itself to be wrong as you don't have to.&#34;"
78834,"I placed a Safer moth trap in 2 separate enclosed closets. After 30 days, neither trap had lured a single moth.The traps themselves are paperboard with a sticky side. A small square of pheromones is in a separate packet. You have to open the packet and put the square on the sticky paperboard. Easy enough.The Safer product just didn't work for me. Easy product to assemble, but zero results."
78835,"I find that I use this a lot more than I thought I would in my shop.  I'm considering buying another so I have one for water soluble stuff and the other for petroleum-based fluids.  Overall, very handy!"
78836,The hope string.The great acting.The horror of it all.don't break our heartsdon't break themdo not.
78837,"I followed the instructions that accompanied this loser and the results were poor. The lid on the tank will not stay closed. I had planned to use this outside but without the lid staying shut this would be an excellent hangout for mosquitos so I left it outside for only about a week and a half. I dropped (pushed would be a better word) the ""hose"" through the hole in the lid. Instructions say insert it until the tip reaches the bottom. I pushed the entire ""hose"" through the hole and it never reached the bottom but remained suspended in the water about two thirds of the way down. The tank hangs on the side of the pot all lopsided and really looks as tacky as all getout. No water ever transferred from the tank to the flower pot during the week or so that I left it outside.Not sure where this was made although there is a USA address on the cardboard but it does not say ""manufactured in"". However I would not blame any manufacturer for not wanting to admit to making this butt-ugly and worthless recycling candidate.There has to be a much better offering of plant watering products than this. Look elsewhere for something that has at least a smidgeon of quality which this does not. Stay away from this - far, far away."
78838,Best show ever- gets better every week- love seeing the softer side of michon  would recommend this series to anyone !
78839,"I give this 4stars as I have to have a longer use period to give a 5 star rating. Worked excellent for one full season. So now Im on the second season and the thing starting leaking between the hose and the sprayer. I thought well here we go now a battle with ray padula and his customer support team or lack of it. So I turn off the water at the faucet and remove the  sprinkler completely then reattach sprinkler tight as I can then turn on water at faucet and no leaks and I gave it a good workout too. So maybe the issue might be to leave the sprinkler on the hose and not keep removing it as I have done. So If I discover any problems down the road I will update but for now I have to recommend this product.Update-- This sprinkler started leaking in the second summer of use . After getting ahold of the Ray Paduka company. They said yes they would replace it but it might take a month to get it . Who would want to wait that long. Forget it ,, what a comeon this is doesnt quite come up as false advertizing but I sure wouldnt recommend doing business with this guy."
78840,"I was completely addicted to this, and the end is even crazier. I have no idea how they will ever resolve it if and when they put out a season two.  But outstanding plot and content and Ming Na is awesome."
78841,"This is a fantastic conditioner -- but a cleaner, it is not. At least, not more than surface dirt and dust. That, however, was fine for my purpose (new leather with nothing more than some surface dirt). It goes on easily, smells great but is not an overpowering scent, and leaves the leather looking nice, dark and clean without any ridiculous shine or slippery feel.I didn't really find it difficult to apply, but it may be a little messy. I just dedicate one cloth for application, do the whole car, and then use another 2 cloths to go back around and wipe up the excess. Takes about 15 minutes on my Nissan. I still prefer Lexol for cleaning and conditioning, but this is a great product for monthly application to protect against UV exposure, which is what I am looking for."
78842,"Had planned to drop these behind the wheels on the truck when we put the boat over.But they want to slip on the concrete ramp as soon as the tire tread starts to push.Doesn't seem to matter whether I plant them before easing the tires back, or hard-place them at the tires, because as soon as enough drift happens, the tire and chock move together."
78843,i liked the little bit of partly true and partly fictional story lines.  poetic license for sure but great fun
78844,"I purchased 3 different timers from 3 different manufacturers.  This one was a tad bit more difficult to get lined up on the spigot correctly, but once in place, worked as advertised.UPDATE--We had a hard sudden freeze.  The other 2 timers came through fine. In fact, they stayed on the spigots all winter. This one cracked and spewed 100+ gallons of water before it was caught.  Would not purchase if there is any chance of a hard freeze before you can remove the unit. I live in the Sacramento Valley, so my idea of a hard freeze is about 28 degrees."
78845,"match my existing wheel chocks.  A little too big a radius on the curved side for my wheels, otherwise would be a 5-star."
78846,I hope this continues. Great storyline and acting. Quality drama right up with the Inspector Lynley Series of character from book to show
78847,"Yet again another great movie from Ti West, don't be put off by the idiotic negativity that other reviews bring about this film, I almost was put off watching it but was glad I went with my own instincts and picked it up, Ti West has made several cool movies such as house of the devil and cabin fever 2, the sacrament is a great movie that's filmed in the style of a group of people making a documentary, its not a found footage movie but similar in style and better, basically a peaceful looking community where the people have found a new home and a new family in each other under the leadership of the father is not what is seems to be as more sinister ideals unfold around the filmmakers putting all lives at danger, the movie is paced well and builds up tension very well too, once you start to get the feeling something is wrong the fear kicks in and the story races to a frightening climax, its not a gore movie but it does have its shocks and suspense and leaves you quite satisfied, Basically the horror here is the overall theme of the movie and the religious aspect, putting your faith in something and it turning ugly, you could even see this as a true story by time it ends, Ti West is a great director and this is a really great movie, defiantly check it out if out if your into original horror/thrillers, its a decent budget movie too with a good cast. There has not been much in the way of horror in 2014 so far and this is one of the best DVD releases so far."
78848,"This is one of the best ""paranormal"" films I've seen.  You know along the lines of all the others (and there are many), this one had a story and decent jump factor, eerie and frightening.  Great story line!  Love the actors - spot on!  Held my interest from the first 5 minutes to the last 20 seconds and left me thinking about it long after.  Don't miss this one - it's a WINNER!  So glad I found it."
78849,"Little Bill is a wonderful show for learning about life, in general, from a young child's perspective.  Having a 3-generational family makes the show very interesting, but the bigger attraction is that the show addresses a 'cross-section' of the U.S./or the world.  The children and families are of varying ethnic backgrounds...something most U.S. based shows lack altogether.  It is culturally sensitive and doesn't dwell upon children who have an 'abundance.'  It is creative, easy to understand and fun.  And absolutely no violence...quite true to Bill Cosby style.  I would recommend this to any child of any background anwhere!  I wish Amazon would offer the entire series, it would be a great thing option for families such as mine that are in search of these kinds of shows for our little ones."
78850,We've been looking for crime lords in all the wrong places! They're up country in their cabins selling their 'stuff' to penniless neighbors! The Marshal is coming to get them. I dearly love this series...
78851,"This Agatha Christie mystery had an American actor (or a British actor portraying an American).  I was intrigued with the women's fashions, as well as the culture.  The premise was interesting as well - a murder at a &#34;disadvantaged youth&#34; home, which also happened to be a grand mansion."
78852,Here in this season we really got some weird cases but the characters were developing even more.  You got to learn more about their backgrounds before they all got together.
78853,I enjoyed it. Acting was good. Didn't expect to see so much of Amanda.....she always plays such good giiiiiiiirls!  I liked how we saw another perspective later on....that was interesting and surprising...almost when you thought you knew it all. Heartbreaking.
78854,"Fits like it should, once winter is here, I will use this to connect the compressor to the water system and blow it out.  All brass construction, well made."
78855,"It was not as good as I thought they would be, the one hour programs seem to be a lot better. Maybe they were to short.."
78856,"Works very good for continuous trimming. Wish had gotten a longer trimmer, as the reach of a 12"" trimmer is only 4"". Actually shorter, due to the curve in the string, which actually reduces the reach to about 3"".But, as long as I know its limitations, we get along OK."
78857,"Great brand name, good product, kills weeds, etc. quickly, need to mix it with water but that saves you money.  If you want the junky stuff in your yard to go away, this is the product for you.  I live on one and one-half acres, so it sure does the job for me.  Wear a face mask and gloves while mixing if you are chemically sensitive."
78858,"This is quite a different show from the &#34;norm&#34;. It definitely keeps us interested. We originally rented it from the Library, but decided to go ahead and buy this & the following 2 seasons."
78859,It does as advertised. Fit perfect on my car and at a fraction of the price the big box stores want to charge for so called upgraded features. These are all you need to keep your stems sealed. Just remember to keep your tires at proper pressure to save money on gas.If this review helped you please let me know. Thanks and happy shopping.
78860,"simple, logic and easy to use.  a useful tool to read data from the computer on your car, read codes and diagnose by yourself with a little search on the web. you can take note on the different indicators to know the ""normal parameters"" of your car, and notice when any change occurs and an error code lights your CEL, that way it will be easier to tell what went wrong.The only con is that there isnt any cable or software to connect to a PC or laptop- that would make it a better tool."
78861,"I'm not sure why this is titled a &#34;sport utility shovel&#34; as I keep it in my hybrid sedan, but regardless it is a solid, light shovel which is good for light-duty and emergency use.It is also quite good for building snow shelters like a quinzhee. The smaller head and adjustable handle allow you to get in and dig out the insides.Happy shoveling!"
78862,Program is put together well. Covers various topics and how alien contact could possible be an interactive part. Each show is well put together and easy to follow and understand.
78863,"Just, how screwed up can one family be?  This documentary seems to portray a fictional family, that is routinely involved with every degrading, unscrupulous, vindictive, vile, inhumane and disgusting trait that anyone can possess - but it's real!  You can't call this extended family &#34;the other half&#34; because &#34;the other half&#34; could never conceive of a lifestyle that barely hangs onto the threads of our collective humanity.  The Whites are, however, such an interesting and unusual mix that I was entertained, beyond belief.  I'm not particularly a Johnny Knoxville (Jackass Movies) fan but this documentary certainly kept my attention."
78864,"i really like being able to see what my battery levels are. this was an easy install, combined with a switch, and the backlight is bright, which i appreciate."
78865,"I was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only 10 bucks but glad I did.This stand is VERY sturdy, well made & durable.Foam padded everywhere guitar touches!! Can be folded for easy transport!! Rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard!!Pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand!!Highly recommended, very happy with purchase!!Joe"
78866,"One of these under my bottom step ain't getting it, I am going to buy another one and put them on each end, one only keeps moving around. Well made, good quality unit."
78867,"Loved, loved, loved, this show!  This is what Smash should have been if it hadn't fallen into the soap opera trap of who is sleeping with who.  This felt smarter, with lots of potential.  The backdrop of this show, an inside look at what happens at the symphony, is a great premise.  If this goes to series, I will definitely watch!"
78868,I use this product to mist onto my black spray in bed liner to give it a shine and prevent UV fading.  So far it has worked great for this purpose.
78869,"This is a well done documentary covering positive psychology, featuring the theories of many doctors within the field. I've heard these theories before, and I honestly believe them to be true. To paraphrase, the general idea is that most Americans have been conditioned to erroneously believe that happiness is some distant goal that can only be achieved by means of achieving grand financial success and the acquisition of materials. However, this is not true- those who seek such elusive happiness get stuck on a never ending treadmill, seeking more and more, and never reaching this magical ""happy place"". Instead, happiness can only be achieved by taking satisfaction in one's current circumstances, by focusing on those things that we can be grateful for (which are oftentimes overlooked in our high speed, material-oriented society).In this film, statistics are offered as evidence for the increasing levels of depression in our population, but I think these are unnecessary- just take a look at the people in your environment and workplace, and it's easy to evaluate how many of them are truly happy. How many of them focus on the things that they don't have... as opposed to those who are grateful for the things that they DO have?The documentary paints the theories of positive psychology with rather broad strokes, but they're sufficient for the purposes of this movie, which is introducing viewers to the benefits of embracing happiness, here and today (not in some distant future where you're hypothetically wealthy and universally adored). They explore the means by which this can be achieved, such as taking pleasure in helping others, spending quality time with loved ones, and appreciation of what your environment has to offer. Scientific explanations are also offered (such as the firing of synapses in the brain and the release of dopamine), so it's not presented as magical mumbo-jumbo. Additionally, there are some interviews with some truly remarkable individuals who come from a wide range of backgrounds, and have come to find their peace and happiness by transforming their perspective on the world. Highly recommended!"
78870,"For the last 30 years I have had a pair of steel ramps.  Heavy to move around and tend to rust.  The Rhino Gear ramps are tough, light weight, and certainly won't rust.  I like that they have the wheel stop to help prevent driving off the ramp and they are a little longer so they slide under the front of the car much better than my old ramps.  Time will tell if the plastic holds up with use but the way they are designed I don't expect any problems."
78871,This show is really witty and I like how he pokes fun at his guests without them even being aware that he's mocking them in front of his viewers.  Like all of his nudity too!
78872,"This show had quirkiness, romance and some serious law cases that were interesting to see how they would come out!"
78873,"Elixir Strings are the best I have ever used, they sound great and last far longer (tonally) than anything else I have tried....."
78874,Learning about the children's services even though it was &#34;Hollywood&#34; tugged at my heart strings. All the actors and actresses were perfect for their part.
78875,"Outstanding acting and storytelling, with quite surprising twists along the way. And the scenery -- stark and beautiful at the same time.  Not too keen on the score, but that's a small quibble about an otherwise excellent series."
78876,"This is a fun, cute movie- blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!"
78877,"I just used this for a gig on Monday ... it's solid, well built, nothing loose or floppy, it stands up straight (extending to almost 7 feet tall), it folds up easily, and is nice and compact when folded ... good enough for me.One further note, when I ordered this, I was thinking that I would be able to just unscrew the vertical section from my round heavy base (which is also an ""On Stage"") and screw it into this tripod ... that's not the case, as the vertical piece here is integral to the tripod base.  I'm not unhappy though, this stand works quite well."
78878,I bought a pair of these and now my hood does not fall on my head anymore. easy to install.
78879,"The plot started out similar to other movies like it, but quickly developed it's own plot. Well made and very entertaining."
78880,"Nothing exciting about these things, but they do the job well. I polished my 1991 Gibson Les Paul with this recently and I'd forgotten how shiny and beautiful that guitar was. Does a great job."
78881,"This is a trick for grill owners that also works well on this unit.My grill has lasted years as a result of the trick, so it works, but it is debatable that you should have to do this with an ""outdoor"" recliner.  In all fairness, the description does state "" the recliner is not meant to be left outdoors year round in all weather"".  The thought is you will put it away when done, and not too many people will recline in rain and snow.You should also realize that the chair is a reclining chair and is relatively light weight.  It will blow away in a strong storm.  My deck chairs are quite heavy in comparison.  So, I would not leave this out intentionally.However, if you are like me, you occasionally forget.  And the next thing you know, the chair is drenched by a thunderstorm.So, apply the grill trick.  Apply a bit of petroleum jelly to the joints where they move.  It helps make them move more smoothly and it protects them from water.  WD40 is a cleaner faster trick also used on grills.  I use the petroleum jelly trick on screws on my grill and not one has rusted.  I use the WD40 on the surface periodically and that works remarkably as well.I have accidentally left the chair out in rain several times over the last two months and there is not a single sign of rust.If you do leave it in the rain and have not applied the trick above, as soon as you can, spray it down with clean water from your hose and leave it in the sun to dry.  If your tap water is heavily mineralized, though, this may not help for long.I want to thank those that posted reviews warning me so I could deal with the problem.And I want to say, this is an incredibly comfortable chair.But from a quality perspective, I cannot give it above 2 stars because of the rust problem.  A slightly more expensive set of stainless steel parts would make the chair unbeatable.  Other chairs, however, appear to address the problem with plastic, and those break.What is is.  I have to live with the fact I bought this chair, so the fix makes it unlikely the days I do forget to store it, that it will rust."
78882,"Got this for my wife's Odyssey.  Easy install and never need to buy another filter, just clean this one.  Runs well."
78883,"In the past I've always limited my search for hose couplings to local hardware stores.  That was a mistake.  After searching Amazon and finding this highly rated product, I decided to give it a try.  Boy is this a heck of a lot better than what I've been getting.Installation is a cinch and once you have it screwed on, it isn't coming off.The threaded part of this coupling is nicely machined and screws together nicely with other attachments.  After I tried one of these, I immediately bought more and used them to replace the couplings on my other hoses."
78884,"I have a red one that is made very similar to this one but I prefer this one because it can sit on a counter top. The other one, can't sit on a counter due to the bottom being too rounded.  Hummingbirds love these feeders!  I love the antique look and they are easy to use. The only thing that would make it better is to be able to sit the bottle on the counter for filling but the hanger gets in the way."
78885,I only watched one episode. It had too much nudity and sex in it. The story line was good but didn't enjoy the rest.
78886,"I never was a big fan of Welliver (Because he always plays the bad gut role so well. That's a compliment to his talent,) as it seems he is almost always cast as the bad guy. The guy you love to hate because of his talent and his role choices. I haven't followed his career closely so I can't say what his score card reads like good guy Vs. bad guy role.He does a good job playing the detective who's life revolves around his work as a homicide detective, He plays a cop who has used his gun on more than one occasion and is currently on trial in federal court for a wrongful death suit for this last shooting. He was cleared by  (LAPD) in the shooting and the only thing that helps him with the pressure (although he doesn't admit to it) is to continue working. He catches a old child murder case after he switches shifts with another team when he hands them a pair of Laker tickets which does a good job of distracting him from his ongoing trial.He is in may ways the typical cop/detective that we have seen so many times in movies and on TV over the years. He is driven, has authority issues, maybe some drinking problems, bends the rules and has lady issues. I hope that his life and role as the detective evolves into something more that this standard mold to bring more to the table.Overall I liked the show and where its seems to be heading and am looking forward to a least a few more episodes to lure me in and set the hook. 3.7 stars"
78887,Unfortunately Futurma is following the pattern of Family Guy.  The season sets have fewer episodes and are more expensive.  I do think it was just as strong as prior seasons. My favorite was the I Phone episode.  I wish that Futurama would do more TV science fiction parody type shows.  I have to wonder if they rotate writers between the Simpsons and Family guy because the humor is very uneven in some episodes.  If the writing keeps improving I would like to see Futurama run twenty seasons like the Simpsons.
78888,got this short cord to go from amp to waa! It works perfect for it I own a few Spectraflex cables and they are all fine
78889,"I bought the Meguiar;s polisher for Christmas! Couldn't wait to use it! Been using their products for years, keeps my cars looking like new! couldn't be happier! :)"
78890,"I couldn't believe it when I saw this in the TV list. I had forgotten about Voyagers, but I was instantly transported (pun intended) back to childhood. I LOVED this show! And looking at it now, Phineas Boggs reminds me a lot of Capt Jack Harkness, magical mystical wristband, and all.I've added Voyagers to my watch list; I have a little boy whom I hope will get as big a kick out of the show as I did."
78891,"This series is addictive for all the right reasons: well-cast, well-scripted, well-acted, with intriguing plots and the right balance of action and cerebration. More, more, more!"
78892,"This was a bargain.  It turned off my engine check light and gave me a list of ready/not ready codes.  I happened to buy this for a 2002 Toyota Corolla that was throwing out a bad CAT code.  I wanted to clear the codes and take the car in for an inspection upon completion of clearing the codes.  The day after I ordered it, I ended up buying a new car.  I did play with it as mentioned above and it performed as expected for my needs.  I didn't drive the car long enough to see if all the codes were set to ready status.  I'll be keeping it, but not the old car.  The price was right compared to many other units."
78893,"I purchased this product from Amazon primarily because of the price. Although I was hesistant about the quality. When it arrived, the product quality was perfect. Mounted with no issues and looks great!!"
78894,"Saw Captain America-The Winter Soldier for the second time today and I'm sure that I will surprise many Avengers fans when I say that I think its the best Marvel film ever and certainly one of my 5 favorite comic book films. (I've met a few other fans who agree with me that this is the best Marvel film ever.)Where to start?  The film is almost non-stop action with one fantastic action sequence after another.  Yet there are some nice dramatic moments such as when the Captain visits the now-elderly Peggy Carter, his romantic interest in the first film, now frail and riddled with Alzheimers.  The film has several other good moments like this and others such as the Captain visiting the Captain America exhibit at the Smithsonian in disguise.If you've read anything about this film (or if you've been watching TV's Marvel's Agents of Shield lately,) you will know the basic plot of this film is the evil Hydra infiltrating the highest levels of Shield.  It is not the Captain fighting aliens in this film like the Avengers but the Captain fighting individuals formerly his friends and comrades.The entire cast is terrific from the very likeable Chris Evans as the Captain and Scarlett Johanssen a scene stealer as the Black Widow.  Samuel L. Jackson returns as Nick Fury and Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill.  Newcomers include Anthony Mackie as the Falcon and Emily VanCamp (the star of TV's Revenge,) as a fellow Shield Agent.Robert Redford also appears as a highly questionable intelligence official.  Everybody in the cast is great and Marvel legend Stan Lee appears in his customary amusing cameo.But as stated before, this film has some of the best action sequences that I've seen and a countdown ending that rivals some of the great James Bond films like You Only Live Twice or The Spy Who Loved Me.I loved the original Captain America-The First Avenger.  I particularly loved the World War II motif.  I love this film even more.  (My only bit of vague criticism is that I wish they had used the Captain America musical theme from the first film.  They use if briefly at the beginning of this film, but thats it.  I'm sorry they didn't use it more.)Anyway, as stated, I've seen this film twice already and I have no doubt I'll be seeing it again as soon as it is released on blu-ray.  However, if you want a really satisfying time at the movies, go see it while you still can.  (Like the other Marvel films, sit through the entire credits for two additional brief scenes.  There is one fairly important scene partway through the credits and a very brief scene at the end of the credits.)"
78895,I love his crustiness and that he struggles with modern gadgets.  He has a great relationship with his partner and his boss attempts to keep these two in check with a firm hand.  Great series.
78896,"I didn't realize until this arrived that there were perches for the hummingbirds, so I was very pleased. The hummers in our area definitely prefer feeders with perches over those without and will empty the one with perches before subjecting themselves to the one without. Perky-Pet has done some feats of engineering to get a top-loading feeder to not spill out from the bottom. It lets you put more in and it's really nice and has a deceptively larger capacity than you'd initially think if you're accustomed to filling hummingbird feeders each week. To test this one out, I took down my other feeders (as is my weekly custom for cleaning) and replaced them with this lone feeder, filled to the brim with home-brew hummingbird nectar (no red dye) that I always prepare for my little flying jewels. At any given time, if you look in the right spots, you can see about 20 hummingbirds perched on branches of trees along our 1-acre yard, but they are so territorial, you usually only see one at the feeder at a time and only for a few seconds before another one or two chase the interloper away.I had this hummingbird feeder out for 10 days with zero traffic to it. I don't know if it's the white flowers, or what that is keeping them from visiting. I would sit vigil (they're used to me standing close for photos, but I was standing many yards away on our porch) for 2 hours without seeing one visitor coming to the feeder... not even hovering to inspect it. I wondered if they'd all migrated away or what happened. After 10 days, I put one of my regular feeders back to join it and the next day, there were hummingbirds at my old feeder, but no hummers would even look at this new feeder. None of my feeders look alike - I've got a square one and a few other designs from Perky-Pet - so it's not like the design would be starkly different from what they're used to being the issue. I don't know if the ruby-throated hummingbirds that are native to the North Texas area in which we live are only interested in red flowers or what is causing the aversion to this feeder - but I have as yet not had one visitor to this lovely feeder."
78897,The cleaner works OK but the bottle sprayer is a piece of junk. The sprayer broke withing the first two minutes I used it. I had to pour the cleaner into a different bottle that had a working sprayer.
78898,Loved  it and bought Season 2 but slightly disappointed in the turn of events regarding the character inter-actions on Season 2.
78899,I hope this show is around for many seasons.  It is nice to see a show which can present adult themed comedy with quite some finesse.
78900,"This is a little red flashlight, period.  Yes, the red light is bright, and yes, it blinks if you set it to do so.  But this would NEVER take the place of a real flare under any circumstances.DO NOT buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit!!!!Most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube.  This one has the light coming off the side, like a beacon or lighthouse.  It can ONLY be viewed from straight on!  While a flare puts out intense light in all directions (like a sparkler) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam.  DO NOT BUY, except as a toy, or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful.Flare?  No way."
78901,"Chips really well BUT the parts are worthless.  On my third session the V-cutter disintegrated; since the cutters are not warranted I contacted MAXTool (Amazon obtained it from MAXTool) and ordered a new cutter.  After installation, on my forth session, the square bushing, part # 6156-200001, disintegrated and this time MAXTool told me that this was a known problem part; however none were in stock and they had no information on when, or if,  the part would be available.  Works great when it works; but sadly it doesn't work reliably and parts are not available.  Do not buy this chipper!KUDO's to Amazon, when I emailed them about this problem, even though I was out of the 30 day return window, I immediately got an email authorizing free UPS return and a refund.  Lousy product but great Amazon customer service; especially in light of useless MAXTool customer service."
78902,"We took this up to the mountains to give it the ultimate test. Unfortunately, we've had a very mild sinter, so the winter test part will have to wait until next December.It is very light weight, packs up into small ball of hose which they said it will. It does grow/expand with the water pressure on and does not kink. This should do the job we need it for but will have to buy another hose since we need 100 feet to get into all areas we need to water and hose off in cleaning.I'd buy this...well, I guess I will buy this again to get the footage needed!"
78903,"I dont recall the exact episodes in season two and am not going to use this time to double check my memory, but we're watching season 6 now since all of the previous episodes were stimulating learning experiences for my child!"
78904,I was never much of a zombie lover but I do like apocalyptic stories and this series manages to combine the two in a most interesting way. Even with the splurge of gore the show is well written and the characters are compelling.
78905,"fits just fine,I have two electric guitars and one bass, nothing can take it down ,you will see it recommended !"
78906,"I've written enough reviews to express my support for Dora and Diego; now, I'm waiting for ALL seasons to be FREE as a loyal Amazon Prime member!Cheers!"
78907,Very happy upbeat show...I learned alot of what a &#34;little person/couplecoupes with different than myself. It isn't just how high things are to reachit is ..well see for yourself ...I highly recommend getting hooked as I haveon this series.
78908,"The story has become wrapped up in itself. Doesn't seem like many new ideas there in terms of plot. But we still  tune in to see how they handle the twists, turns...and how they look while doing it."
78909,"Okay, I'm an addict and this is actually my fourth Weber grill...I buy one every four to five years, use it often, treat it poorly, and when it starts to show signs of age, I simply spring for a new one. Until I discovered the Weber, I seldom even got a year out of my grills - so this is quite an improvement for me. The quality of the product, and the results I get, are topnotch, and today, I wouldn't consider any other brand (except maybe a built-in Hastings - but that's another animal altogether).I go back and forth between the 22.5 inch and the 26 inch version. The 26 is more expensive, but it offers quite a bit more cooking area. It also uses quite a bit more charcoal, and to my eyes, it doesn't heat quite as evenly. Instead, I've settled on the 22.5, and on those relatively rare occasions when I need more grilling area, I just run a second grill.One thing I especially like is that Weber is so popular, you can get replacement parts just about anywhere. It's nice to know that if I open the grill in the Springtime and the grates are all rusty, I can zip over to the local hardware store and probably find an exact replacement.This time I went for the blue version, but otherwise it's the same Weber I've come to love. Easy to clean, rugged - and it cooks as well as anything out there. I'm not a fan of gas grills...they simply don't seem to get hot enough for certain uses. But with the Weber and some quality charcoal and you're all set, no matter what's on the menu.Only very small complaint is that I've had some problems with the paint peeling off under the top cover. In the past, once I noticed this happening, I simply scrubbed all the loose paint off with a wire brush...curious to see if this one has the same problem.Really recommended!"
78910,Works great for pre washing pads/towels if you can't wash them after use. Towels and pads seem much softer using this and regular detergent (small amount).
78911,"Even though I am not a young man, I am and always have been fascinated with fairy tales if they are good interpretations of theoriginal stories.  I loved the new interps of Peter Pan, Neverland, Alice, the Secret Garden (1990s)and such stories.  I love the newdarker versions, more for adults than children such as Tin Man and Neverland.  Anyway though this series does vary somewhatfrom the original stories, it is brilliantly written, acted and photographed that certainly meets my requirements.  The Red Queen isevil, but not totally evil, Jafar, the nasty Sorcerer is evil, but again had a very terrible upbringing and generates some sympathy, andeven Alice had family problems.  Here we bring together many of the elements of the original story with additional characters, suchas the Geni and the Rabbits family (cute!)  And how about the Knave of Hearts, who was originally Will Scarlet of the Robin Hoodgang.  I like the flash backs as well as the beautifully executed special effects, the sky islands , the strangely triangular trees andthe domino walkways.  The chess piece castles remind me a bit of the buildings in Alice, but  fit in very nicely here.  No Queenof Hearts, but this appears to be inspired by the THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS part of the Wonderland tales.  I have seenat this date all eight episodes in my Video Library (AMAZON) and I look forward to seeing the series continue on for quite a while.I would like to see, however, that each season be complete in itself, with a new adventure starting with the next season.  But Iwill still watch regardless.  I recommend this series to those who like the fantasy-fairy tale-sci fi elements in stories like these.And I think Alice is cute and spunky...and I LIKE SPUNK!!"
78912,"Let me start off saying that you cannot go wrong buying any of the series of Mighty Bright music stand lamps.  The Orchestra lamp in particular is a fantastic product.  It provides plenty of smooth, even light and is sleek in design.  And the carrying case makes it very portable.  Fits best on flat metal, and has a tight clamp.  I have a portable stand which does not have a flat metal base...so I used a sturdy piece of foam board to clamp to...works great.  The unit uses three AA batteries. I started off using 3  batteries and they do work but light drops off within about four hours.  I prefer to use the 13 foot adapter cord.  I am an older person who has old eyes. Sometimes lower C and lower A look alike.  Mighty Bright Orchestra Light to the rescue!  The clip is also much larger than the image would let you believe; however, the base is curved to allow your music to easily lay on top.Some comments have indicated that when plugging the AC adapter into the base apparently did not disconnect the batteries as expected. The unit I purchased does disconnect the batteries upon insertion of the power cord into the clip. To confirm this on your unit: (1) DISCONNECT the AC adapter from the wall and from the light, (2) load batteries into the clip, and turn on the light, finally (3) with the AC adapter STILL DISCONNECTED from the wall outlet, plug the cable into the base. The light should go out. If it doesn't, your unit is not isolating the batteries from the AC adapter, and may present a fire hazard if the batteries are installed when the AC adapter is plugged in."
78913,"Shaun the Sheep is good hearted fun with short bits between longer segments.  Disco dancing Shaun, Scottish jig dancing Shaun."
78914,I am not a critic but have found this series very enjoyable.  This is so much better than the original series that it is simply a step up in entertainment.  A good way to fill in some winter and bad weather hours.
78915,"Spader, who I have always been a fan of, drives this show from the back seat of a Benz and does it with such class that you just sit back and enjoy the ride. The rest of the cast does an incredible job (I'm always a huge fan of Harry Lenix) keeping up with him. All the intrique of a spy movie, mixed with a crime thriller and just a touch of antagonizing protagonist make for the best show I have seen in a long time, certainly the top in it's genre. I know that it's going to leave me in tears when I find out the major plot twist and I am excited for the story from now until then. 10/10 amazing show."
78916,"My car is about 10 years old so there is some oxidation on my paint.  After cleaning the paint with clay, the paint was smooth and clear again.  I didn't realize how not white my white car had become.  Keep in mind that you have to put on a coating of wax after the clay treatment.  I used Astro Shield (wax) and my car now shines like new.The clay also took out some light surface scratches but it's much less abrasive than rubbing compound.  All things considered, This is a unique and useful product."
78917,If you don't start out liking it keep on watching it gets better. Below are my ratings of each individual season.Season 1: 7/10Season 2: 8/10Season 3: 6/10Season 4: 10/10Season 5: 9/10Season 6: 9/10Season 7: 10/10Season 8 (the final season) is hopefully good.
78918,"This partial capo from Kyser has the same design, construction, and ease of use as Kyser's top-ranked and bestselling 6-string cano. It is definitely recommended. If you choose to go down he partial capo path, though, it's best that you either jam with friends who are familiar with partial capos or buy Randall Wolliams' manual on the partial capo, since its use is not intuitively obvious."
78919,I love Survivor Gabon a lot it was really fun that the Fang and Kota are the Gabon Tribes nice
78920,"I've been using elixers on my Godin Multiac Steel SA for many years now. They have a great, not-too-bright sound and you don't get the string noise when you move your hands across the neck like you do with traditional strings. These tend to last me about 3 months! So, I am very happy with them. They also track pretty well with my roland synth, so no gripes there. All in all I really like these strings and think they sound great."
78921,This item was way beyond the quality I expected.....very solidly built and so easy to operate.....Got tired of lifting 75 lb dollies to move 50 lb items...The day after it arrive my daughter took it to move a hutch type cabinet(probably at the carts limit)..handled it so easy.......when done with it it folds up and goes in the trunk of my Miata with lots of room to spare.....One handy item......
78922,"I use this on myYuasa YUAM32ABS YT12A-BS Batteryto make sure it stays charged.  It's a must have during the winter storage months.  It takes a while to get to the float mode because it's the jr, but it does it's job."
78923,"If you used to watch Daria, then you will love owning this as well. My family used to tape the show and quote it extensively, but I didn't realize I could actually own it. On my recent birthday I wondered what I could buy that would make me the happiest, thought of Daria and did a search for it. I was pleased to find it on amazon.com."
78924,"My old chrome plastic frame had to be replaced and this time I wanted a metal frame to hopefully last longer. So far it looks great. I wish it came with Screws (hence 4 stars), other than that it is OK. I did get 2 additional plastic screws for the button holes to hold the plate to the frame and make it look better."
78925,It does remind me a little of Mister Roger;s but in an animated form. My son loves it and really that is what matters.
78926,This is by far the easiest thing I have installed on my jeep yet.  Only took about 3 minutes to unpack and install.  Seem very secure and looks awesome.  Don't know why anyone would have complained about not being able to install them unless they were trying to install them upside down or backwards.
78927,this season was pretty interesting. The crew on this season had some stand outs that I would want to survive the end of the world with!
78928,"I started watching this season on Netflix and got hooked, had to buy Season 4 so that I could continue watching!! Great show!!"
78929,"Very interesting.  Even though I have watch other programs on President Kennedy, I found this one very interesting because it focused a lot on his father. This brought information I was not aware of.  Enjoyed the show recommend it."
78930,Bought this Stove top and my wife loves it. It gives additional counter space when the stove is not in use. It looks great and works great.
78931,it holds a mic just fine. I just wish it had a little more &#34;give&#34; to it. still a great product for the price
78932,"The huge blackbirds cannot steal from this one.  I feed big birds and even squirrels, but needed a feeder that the finches and smaller birds could utilize.  This is it, and I love it.  It is also very attractive."
78933,What's not to like about these stories and characters. Well if Capt Hastings and Inspector Jepp were in them it would get 5 stars.And these episodes are longer than the original series. Worth watching -- I hope Amazon switches some more of the later series to PRIME.
78934,"Okay, I'm still getting into the characters but the plots seem a little thin and stereotypic--and the premise (a cantankerous, hardened cop who breaks the rules but is a nice guy under the grit, with a charming &#34;almost human&#34; sidekick) needs some more involved direction and suspense. The special effects are nothing to write home about. Something is lacking but I'll stick with it in its teething months.  All right, I'll say it:  it's &#34;almost good&#34;."
78935,"i've had these straplocks for a few years now and they haven't failed me once! i love them, and i never have to worry about my guitars getting damaged from a strap falling off or so. they rotate in full circles, and are super durable. you should buy them for all your guitars, and you'll never have to worry again. they are also very easy to use, and &#34;install&#34;."
78936,This is a great movie. I really wish the series would start up again. I LOVE all of these characters. The movie was interesting and kept me interested.
78937,I REPLACED THE WATER PUMP SO DECIDED TO REPLACE THE BELTS TOO... PERFECT FIT FOR 2002 ESCALADE 5.3L.... NO MORE SQUEAKING IN THE MORNINGS....NICE
78938,"I'm not sure how accurate this thing is.  I have a new battery but this will show less than 12V after a few hours with the engine off.  It will, however, show over 14V after the engine is started.  I would assume if it stays consistent that you can tell if there is a problem at some point in the future.  I think this is more useful than the factory gauge.  I would recommend getting this type of voltage meter if your battery is getting old."
78939,I learn so much from watching these guys. Great show. Never gets old. Always something different. Frank and Mike are great together.
78940,"Decent product, more heavy duty than some of the cheap, flimsy factory frames.  Makes for a good frame for support of the plate when you have a vehicle that requires amount to the front bumper fascia of the vehicle."
78941,"So not my top choice out of the Amazon Originals, but this was more entertaining than Glee. The acting was excellent for the most part; the only thing I could not work out was how in the world the producers managed to find the one black guy who can't sing! Actually, neither can Brigette Davidovici. But replace those two, and you got yourself a top notch show!"
78942,Not sure why I can't find black ones since the tubing is black. I bought the more expensive easy-fit ones that are black for anything that was visible and these for the ones I planned on burying underground. Only complaint is that these are really hard to put on.
78943,"I liked it has a nice balance of intrigue, action and suspense. I would like to see more but it stopped on episode five.It is easy to imagine how all that control would make it easy to control crime, medical treatment and so forth, but it is also scary to give all tha information meaning power to someone or a government."
78944,I really like this series. Full of eyewitness interviews and reenactments that create an enjoyable show. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes this genre.
78945,"This kit works perfect in a 2011 Jeep Wrangler when installing an HID kit...If you are trying to put HID lights in a Jeep Wrangler (probably all Jeeps) you need this along with your HID kit...  You DO NOT need the relay or the resistors to make your lights work correctly.  The relay harness won't hurt anything but you don't need to spend the money and the resistors don't do any good.  I just spent the better part of three weeks messing with my 2011 Jeep Wrangler trying to put in an HID light kit and get them to work correctly.  If you want to save yourself a lot time and money, just do what I did... Buy the HID kit and the canceller, that's all you need. I have saved you from having to go thru all the trial and error. Any questions email me at OBX411@HOTMAIL.COM and I'll share any info I have......."
78946,I love the Stargate Universe series. The actors are so perfect for their parts and it is a joy to watch this science fiction action. I higly recommend it to all scifi fans.
78947,"I have heard good things regarding this pedal so I was always interested, but never pulled the trigger on purchasing it. When a buddy of mine who happens to be a professional musician began talking about it, I said I think I'd better check this out.IM GLAD I DID!boys and girls time to break open the walletsgreat tone and drive within this little boxyou'll be adding it to the board just like I did"
78948,This is a thriller from start to finish.  I watched Benedict Cumberbrand I think that's his name in Sherloch Holmes for PBS.  When I saw he was in this I wanted to watch immediately.  It kept me guessing right to the end.
78949,give this as a Christmas gift. works well and powerful blast of air to reach the hard to get places. and made in the USA
78950,This is the real deal. I own an old airplane and it needed some work. I used this to buff the old plexiglass windscreen and to bring back the sparkle to the old paint. The adjustability is perfect and so is the weight. I'm super happy with this polisher and look forward to using for many years. I'll probably have to designate who get this in my will otherwise my kids are going to fight over it.
78951,"Which are likely to get in the way for people who know anything about Berkeley politics, real estate, or the cost of living.The counterweight comes from there being SOME interesting characters."
78952,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched the pilot. The characters and plot appeal, but its so slow. I couldn't help but think &#34;get on with it already.&#34;"
78953,"I tried yellow plastic washers and a quick connect set purchased at Lowes, they didn't work. Despairing of finding a solution, I put this washer in yesterday. Success! No leaks when turned on hose. Hoping for best.Update 9/27/12 Still no leaks!"
78954,"As always, Stephen King knows how to deliver a story. This is no exception and for those who like his work, they won't be disappointed."
78955,"Our 1957 Pontiac Star Chief Custom Catalina has more stainless steel than typically seen in the showroom of any major kitchen and bathroom superstore! From its waterfall front grill, to the light covers and surrounds, to the spinner wheels and caps, and all the way down the jet runners on each side... man-o-man, hours worth of work to keep that stainless clean and shiny.Cleaning stainless is a tedious job, at least it is to do it right on our cars, but Eagle On Nevr Dull is the exact product for the job. Try it... put a little effort into the job and pay attention to detail... and you will be very proud when the job is done.I read another review where the person pulled the entire wool wad out of the jar and tried to use it to clean their item like a big rag... that's just not the way to go. Step by step; piece by piece...First thing to do is to give your item a good washing and dry it off. Then use this product one big pinch at a time, maybe pinching off a piece the size of a large marble or cherry tomato, and use it to really work over the dirty spots... an area that is maybe five square inches is what we work on at one time (smaller if really dirty).  Work it over using firm circular rubbing movement, and use both sides of the wool until it is either too dirty or to worn -- and then get another pinch and keep going. Yes, this takes some time BUT you will be amazingly happy with the end result.Once clean, then wipe the stainless with a good clean cloth, apply a good coat of wax, and lightly buff the car to a shine. Now, stand back and look at yourself smile right there in the reflection of the piece you were working on! Seriously. It is that good, and a little bit of it goes a very long way.If looking for a good stainless cleaner, this one is highly recommended by a guy who uses it a lot."
78956,"Love the show and the characters. Even Juliette who I found so annoying at the beginning really has grown on me by this season. I am glad this show is still going and I hope it continues to. The characters are likable, and interesting for the most part. I guess I would have to say that the royals storyline is less interesting to me than the day to day of the main characters but it isn't overbearing, it isn't taking over the show. I do find myself not really paying attention when they are in that part of the show.I realize that the wesen are the reason for the show but it is starting to look like the only crimes that are ever committed are by wesen now and not human :). This isn't a major flaw, but I find it amusing that the crime gets committed and then in the investigation they figure out that it is wesen EVERYTIME. It wouldn't be interesting if it sometimes wasn't wesen, but just something I noticed. I am not sure there is a way around it. Unless you turned them into the detectives that are brought in on &#34;unexplained&#34; or unusual crimes.. but thats been done so many times too.All in all, this is a really entertaining show. Not too overly serious or scary, but also not too cheesy in my opinion. It strikes a good balance. It isn't silly although sometimes the effects are not perfect. This is fine, we know it isn't real and it helps it not turn into a horror show. Just good fun."
78957,"When I ordered this trap, we had a critter, most likely a rat, in the garage.  The rat was actually smart enough to move the glue traps out of his way as he made his way around the garage, shredding anything in sight that looked comfy.  I ordered this trap in the hopes that he would not be wise to this type of trap design and know to avoid it.  After we set this trap up, the rat seemed to have left either of his own free will or a neighborhood cat, so I can't tell you if this trap would have worked for sure or not.  However, I didn't feel it right to downgrade the product just because we no longer had a rat in our midst to field test it.It was easy to set up and place food in the center.  I touched the center part with the food through the bars with a stick, and the cage doors on the ends shut quickly as promised.  I think if we did have a rat this would work.  We are keeping it set up in the garage with food for the next rodent visit, just in case. It is kinder than a glue trap or a snap trap, so I am happy to have it around."
78958,"I love this series, it's a traditional period piece with just the right amount of happenings and social dilemma.  The actors are all great and the story line is good, you can't wait to get to the next episode despite the rather dreary circumstances of the citizens of cranford"
78959,"I don't know if I have moths, and I have not seen any damage to my wool coats. The Safer Moth Alert is supposed to let me know if I have moths, then I can treat them accordingly. I've had this in my closet a few weeks and it's still empty. I would assume that means that I don't have anything to worry about. I'll leave it in place, in case moths come in later. I'm glad that I don't have to put mothballs in the closet, and I even don't like the scent of cedar. This is an easy way to know if additional action is needed."
78960,"I think setting this show in an asylum gives it an opportunity for much more interesting stories and characters.  It was hard to stay with one family in one house last season.  By the end of season one I was exhausted and not willing to take so many leaps of faith.  This season is already a huge improvement because the weirdness is spread around.  Like all Ryan Murphy series, this one is very stylish with great music and a great cast"
78961,"I've paid hundreds of dollars more for guitars that didn't sound anywhere near as nice and natural as this one does. And, mind you, I have yet to even change the facory strings out! So if you're looking for a quality guitar at a price that's more than fair, there simply isn't a better deal around."
78962,"On Stage makes some very nice products.  This music stand has all the adjustments as one of our favorite older units.  Well made and the price doesn't put it out of range for the everyday musician.  Really am liking On Stage products, also bought 2 of their boom mic stands and they are excellent."
78963,I couldn't get through it...too slow and too dark (content)...didn't hold my attention! Might try it again later but not sure.
78964,We already have one pack of 10 of these levelers but found that we might need more so I ordered another set so we can have them on hand for our RV trips in case of a severely un-level parking pad!  We used them on our last RV trip and loved them.  No wood to have to carry everywhere you go!  Great product and would recommend!
78965,"I love how much this show is about those awkward, yet hilarious family moments.  I adore their love for wine and wish I could join them for a beverage or five.  Courtney Cox is wonderful!"
78966,AB just keeps improving on his already-excellent style of cooking instruction.  What I REALLY like about these newer seasons is that he's taking more and more classics and giving them a facelift (or sometimes just showing us a better way to do it). He's still the best!
78967,"I tow a 33 ft. Travel Trailer with a 3500 Chevy Express van.  We drove in excess of 25,000 miles with these mirrors (and still going!).  I have intended to come back to Amazon and review many of the products we purchased in preparation for our trip around the country and today I had time while I was listening in to a conference call!  :)  These mirrors look a little clunky to me and I was unsure of how they would work.  I researched strap-on mirrors extensively before I purchased them and I have been VERY happy with their performance.  They have never wobbled or been unstable while I drove.  They provide a great additional mirror to be able to see into my towing blind spot.  Really the only reason I rated them 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think they look clunky.  They don't mesh well with the shape of my van's mirrors, but they fit, and they fit sturdily (is that a word?).  But they have the look that they are kind of jammed onto something they weren't designed for.  No big deal in the big picture, since they quite literally give you a &#34;big picture&#34; of what's behind you.  We have been very satisfied with these."
78968,"I like this a lot better than ArmorAll. It smells nice and doesn't leave any residue behind. It's more expensive than other stuff, so I'm not thrilled about that. If it was under $10 I would give it 5 stars."
78969,"If your working with spark plugs you need this. As standard as they come and guaranteed to work.  Helped me gap my plugs with no problems. If you don't know how to use, just youtube it."
78970,"if you dont know what this little gizmo does ill explain.where you air up or air down your tire, there is a little bitty valve installed in that rubber valve stem.  when you have a bigger offroad mud terrain tire (i have two sets, 35'' and 37'') it takes FOREVER getting down to 15 pounds of pressure from the 30 to 35 pounds i normally run.  when i say forever i dont really mean forever, more like 3 minutes or so per tire.  that doesnt sound bad, but times that by four and you are at 12 minutes just airing down.  thats 12 minutes you could be trying to break something expensive on your offroad vehicle.this little gizmo removes that valve completely while housing it in its body.  there is a part of the body that slides back then wham-o, you are airing down with no valve in the valve stem.  you are now looking at around a minute or so per tire.4 minutes versus 12 may sound trivial, but when you are wanting to go play in your jeep, toyota, whatever and you are stuck with a tiny stick or rock you found on the ground poking at the top of the valve stem you will wish you had this guy."
78971,"2 piece all brass works great, no issue after many year outdoors.Made in usa, expect to last forever but wish price come down a bit."
78972,"This is good product, works well but have to consider two things. The first is that light is not very bright, at least not as bright as one would originally OEM dome light in any car. The second point is that the straps are too short to be able to fit well in the roll bar that is above the seats, is rather to sujaterse seamlessly into the rollbar of the sides of the side windows.That is why I'm taking 2 stars out from 5."
78973,This item works great easy set up instructions have used it several times to clear throttle body codes on my 2012 Chevy Silverado 2500HD Ext Cab I get the code due to installing a throttle body spacer on 6.0 liter 368 cu. in. Only when engine is at 5500 rpm and below 30 degrees out 4.10 gears don't help gets up there to quick.
78974,"I have purchase other vent insulators with limited results as they were not snug fitting and would eventually fall out after installation.  I purchased one Camco 45162 RV Vent Insulator to test, and found it to be a very good, snug fit.  I immediately purchased another and it too was well made and snug.  A great value which will keep the cold and heat in or out, as the case may be.  You can't beat the price, especially with the free shipping."
78975,"Focusing on the lives of physicists, and geeky ones at that, does make for an atypical television series, but a great cast, original characters, and high quality writing, combine to produce a modern comedic gem.  Created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, it understandably took a little while for the creative team to develop the personalities of the characters.  But once the basic parameters were set, The Big Bang Theory began to boldly go where no comedy has gone before.With characters that always seem to be evolving, the series explores some unusual topics, and frequently heads into uncharted territory, usually making it impossible to predict what may happen.  This is one of the main reasons why this unique, goofy, show is so hilarious and captivating.  The creative team taps into facets of pop culture that may be associated with geeks and nerds (and teenage boys in general), and find ways to weave them into their stories, often in an exaggerated way.  Science fiction, comic books, superheroes, video games, television, action figures, paint ball fights, Star Wars, and the Star Trek universe, are just a few of the subjects that are featured.The cast is marvelous, with Johnny Galecki as Leonard Hofstadter, the shy guy enchanted by his new neighbor.  Jim Parsons is Sheldon Cooper.  If you look up the word neurotic, Sheldon's photo just might be there.  Simon Helberg is Howard Wolowitz, the delusional sleaze, who does still have his good points.  Kunal Nayyar is Rajesh Koothrappali, who can't speak to a beautiful woman unless he is under the influence of alcohol.  Kaley Cuoco is Penny, the girl from Omaha who moved next door, works at the Cheesecake Factory . . . . and changed their universe.Since Sheldon is off the scale when it comes to weirdness (what Penny would later come to describe as `whackadoodle'), and Wolowitz and Raj are arguably more `abnormal', Leonard seems the most sensible of the bunch.  Sheldon is totally unique, so bizarre in his beliefs, behavior and speech, that he seems at times to be from another planet.  Jim Parsons is a amazing comic talent, with a bright, bright future.Penny has a multi-faceted role.  One is as the primary female character, another is that she usually represents as close to a 'normal' persons' point of view as we will get.  As a link to reality, she is often the reference that shows just how wacked out the guys really are.  The times when she joins them in their world (such as when she fragged Sheldon on Halo night), are often some of the program's funniest moments.  By the end of the season, everything about the show is clearly peaking.  In `The Pancake Batter Anomaly', Sheldon gets sick, and Penny gets stuck taking care of him, rubbing Vaporub on his chest, and singing `Soft Kitty'.  In `The Bat Jar Conjecture', it's Sheldon's team versus the rest of the gang and Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert), in the Physics Bowl.  Sheldon's knockout of a twin sister arrives and makes waves, in `The Pork Chop Indeterminacy'.  Sheldon gets a look in the mirror, in `The Jerusalem Duality' when a young genius arrives on campus.  In `The Nerduana Annihilation', when Leonard buys the time machine used in the classic 60's film `The Time Machine' on eBay, Penny's  astute description is that `It looks like something that Elton John would drive through the Everglades'.  In the season finale, there's a glimmer of hope for romance for Leonard, in `The Tangerine Factor' when Penny agrees to go out with him.The Big Bang Theory is simply one of the most engaging comedies to come along in years.  Each episode seems to fly by, and leave you wanting more.  Some commentary tracks would have been cool, but the only bonus is the `Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory' a look at the creators, cast, and genesis of the show.  There are only seventeen episodes in the First Season due to the writers' strike.Things only get better in the second season, as the show's creative team continue to develop the characters, and introduce new elements to the mix, keeping things fresh and extremely funny.  As Sheldon Cooper might say, it is a foregone conclusion that the third season will be characterized by the same outstanding writing, and brilliantly quirky humor found in the first two seasons, continuing to keep The Big Bang Theory, at the cutting edge of contemporary comedy."
78976,"This series undoubtedly doesn't even scratch the surface of Commie infiltration of out government, to say nothing of radical Islam infection of our society and proliferation of narco-terrorists cells throughout America.  We don't need threats from abroad.  We have all we need right here."
78977,works ok for the price and features it is fine. get the batteries it did not came with any. I am using it for a dj karaoke system I do recommend it.
78978,"The Base for this thing is a monster! The thing works great, and because of the very strong load the base provides - not the easiest thing to accidentally knock over."
78979,"This is a great opening. Nonstop excitement. Definitely my new favorite. Of course it is only episode one, so I'll be watching more episodes and reviewing. So far I am wholeheartedly behind it. They've touched on just about all the questions left at the end of the last season. Darn. I wanted a two hour premiere.....Episode two. What can you say, complete ethical hairball. On one hand Nick was unwillingly drugged out of his mind, and magically turned into a killing machine. Was it his fault? Is he to blame for the actions he perpetrated after Samedi made him into a zombie? Or were Samedi and Eric Renard the true murderers? On the other hand, someone died, and it was Nick's body was the tool that caused the death. And that poor family, those kids. Awful. Does Nick's lack of consent, his being forcibly drugged eliminate his responsibility? Maybe. Two have been punished for their horrible misdeeds. Eric and the Baron. Is it enough? If Nick is held responsible for what he could not control, will justice be served?The group has made their choice. And I think it is pretty expected. They are now all bound by the decision, yet Nick is going to be tortured by it, it is only because he is a good man that he is so horribly torn and troubled. I do not see why Renard has kept the flash, best destroy it completely. And in Europe Adalind is messing with Sean's child, and also and accessory to murder as a much more aware participant... surely that can not be forgiven, is more heinous a crime. What is going to happen next? Certainly living up to the Horror show tag. Can't wait for more. The Renards... Nick.... Adalind.... Nick looking like a zombie again....where is that gonna go? Eek."
78980,"This product is great.  It is constructed of stainless steel and is heavy gauge,  so it should last a while.  Today I used it the first time and it puts out some good smoke while cooking.  Just ensure the chips are wet or they will not smoke correctly."
78981,My wife and I enjoy this show very much. I hope they keep it going for at least 3 to 5 years.
78982,Only gave it 3 stars. You will need get flat washers to put on each side of the plastic or the bolts will pull through. I used Number 8 Flat washers.  Could be built better. But for me it will work. Good Luck
78983,"Like anything else that cleans, you usually have to use a little elbow grease to make these cleaners work.  If you leave this product on for a few minutes and then brush grill with a steel brush, most (not all) of the junk comes off.  A second coating usually will do the trick unless it is super gross black oil/charcoal stuff baked on.  At least you don't inhale all kinds of naseous fumes like some products."
78984,"The digitech main squeeze is an okay compression pedal. Do I use it? yes. However, I would likely trade it for an MXR or DUNLOP if I had the opportunity. It doesn't sound bad per se' but does have some hiss to it. It also boosts your signal (a noticeable volume increase). While some may like this, I want my compressor to be a little more subtle and just provide some added sustain."
78985,"This product is made of heavy black plastic and does not look conspicuous on your lawn. It is also only a couple of feet in diameter and about 3' high. You put water in the base and forget about it until something goes in its path, then it suddenly squirts water where it picked up motion. It is so funny to see animals react. It will get you too! If you forget to aim it in another direction. The main drawback is that the moles eat my bulbs from under the earth where the repellent cannot ""see"" them."
78986,"Ever notice how every youtube video has pedals being demoed with either a Strat or a Tele?  We we can debate why that is but one thing for certain is it is tough to get an accurate idea of what an LP will sound like till after you unbox it.  After hours of research I decided on the FD2 since it seemed to have a lot of tuning options and I actually found a review using an LP into a clean amp.[...]Essentially, you get 3 modes which have varing degrees types of OD and a second boost mode to push things even father.  What I liked about this pedal is you can use the comp cut or flat mids with an LP and not increase the bottom end or mids which often Teles or Strats need.  Hence, you can go from slight boost to huge gain without turning into mud like some pedals will do.  The only downside is with so many options you will constantly be playing with the knobs and switches and finding new sounds.  Works fantastically with modeling amps which need varying amounts of clean and dirty OD depending on what you are modeling."
78987,"Easy to install, perfect fit, very nice product. From package to finish 5 minutes, Look's and feels really well on Jeep."
78988,Fits very well on my les Paul 100
78989,"Good product if you store ethanol gas in anything. Ethanol turns back into water in a few short weeks. This stuff combines with the water and allows it to burn. Great for lawn mowers, motorcycles, etc. that you store over winter."
78990,"****1/2Ramona Diaz&#8216; &#8220;Don&#8217;t Stop Believin&#8217;: Everyman&#8217;s Journey&#8221; may not be the most &#8220;important&#8221; documentary of the past several years, but it is certainly one of the most fascinating. And uplifting.The movie begins with a predicament: the remaining members of the classic rock group Journey have decided to both return to the studio to start recording new material and go on tour where they will need to perform all their familiar hits for their millions of rabid fans who are expecting them to sound the way they did decades before. Yet, their lead singer, Steve Perry, has long since left the group. What are a bunch of aging rockers to do?  The answer they come up with is to mount a search for someone who can approximate Perry&#8217;s distinctive and universally recognizable vocal stylings. That&#8217;s where Arnel Pineda comes in - an amateur singer in the Philippines who had previously posted 60 videos of himself mainly doing cover versions of Journey&#8217;s hits on-line. The similarity between his voice and the voice of Perry is uncanny, so the group plucks him out of obscurity and puts him front-and-center with them on stage and in the studio. This movie is a record of that experience.To show just how far he&#8217;s risen, the movie briefly chronicles Arnel&#8217;s hardscrabble life as an orphan in the Philipines, often living on the streets, literally singing for his supper and that of his siblings. Drug and alcohol abuse and a broken marriage also figure prominently in Arnel&#8217;s pre-Journey history. But all that is in the past, as now he not only gets to perform with his favorite band, but he is happily married with a young daughter. Indeed, the only negative aspect of the tour for Arnel is that it requires him to be away from his home and loved ones for such an extended period of time. But such is the life of a rock star.The movie also fleshes out the history of the band itself, from its years of worldwide success to its periods of wilderness-wandering obscurity, from its temporary dissolution in the &#8216;90s to its successful comeback today. These experienced, wiser heads are able to keep this newbie focused on not only what is good about touring, but the potential pitfalls that await someone not ready for all that comes with fame and glory and life on the road. Thanks in large part to them but also to his own inner strength of character, Arnel is able to keep his feet planted firmly on the ground, even while his head is, understandably, in the clouds.And indeed throughout the experience, Arnel remains a humble, self-effacing figure, a man who, despite being overwhelmed by the adoration of Journey&#8217;s fans, never allows himself to  forget where it is he came from and how extraordinarily blessed he is in being able to live out this never-in-my-wildest-dreams fantasy-come-true.As for the original members of the band - Neal Schon, Ross Valory, Jonathan Cain, Deen Castronova - they do tend to become bit-players in the film while Arnel takes center stage, but it is clear that they are equally cognizant of the fact they owe as much to Arnel as he does to them for helping make this hugely successful comeback possible. It is obvious that the members not only welcome Arnel in with &#8220;open arms&#8221; but that a genuine bond of fellowship and friendship has developed amongst them.As Arnel himself admits, this is really a rock music Cinderella story with Neil Schon, who discovered him, as the fairy godmother and the tour the grand ball.And the whole thing culminates in a raucous performance of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Stop Believing&#8221; before a stadium full of screaming, adoring Filipino fans, all beaming with pride at the sight of a home town boy hitting the big time - and if that scene doesn&#8217;t leave you with a lump in your throat and a chill running up and down your spine, you just might want to get those two organs checked out for defectiveness.Even those who don&#8217;t much care for Journey - if any such people exist amongst us - can have a great time with this film."
78991,"These are nice, sturdy corners for joining 2x lumber together.  I used them just today to put together a 4' x 8' raised bed with 2x8 pressure-treated wood.  To assemble the box, you line up the boards in a rectangle (I put the 4' boards inside the two 8' boards), place the bracket over the corner and hammer it on.  There are tabs in the bracket that dig into the wood.  You will also want to screw the brackets into the bottoms of the boards through the 4 holes in each bracket with some weather-resistant screws, like 1.5&#34; deck screws.  This pulls the boards to the bottom of the bracket evenly.  Then turn over the rectangle, cover the bottom with weed fabric, and it's ready to fill - I will be using a mixture of 1/3 peat moss, 1/3 topsoil and 1/3 compost.When I got the box upright, the tops of the boards seem to want to separate.  I will be buying some &#34;L&#34; brackets to screw into the tops of the boards to hold them together.  Then it should be pretty sturdy.  I think you will need these brackets on the top if you use anything larger than 2x6 boards because the boards would stick up above the brackets and be prone to separate as they warp."
78992,"As anyone can tell you, comedies are a tough sell, especially when broaching such subject matter as the end of mankind.  Some wouldn't dare find anything close to that a laughing matter, but when it's used merely as a backdrop for broader, more general comedy, it certainly can be a nice filter.  That's exactly what writer/director Todd Berger set out to do with IT'S A DISASTER: he combined an end-of-the-world scenario and mashed it up with a twentysomething and thirtysomethings coming-of-age comedy (THE BIG CHILL meets PERFECT SENSE.  On many counts, it just doesn't quite work; yet, there's something wonderfully sublime about seeing a bunch of self-centered shallow suburbanites get their comeuppance ... even if that comeuppance is a nerve-gas Apocalypse.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Emma (played by the comely Erinn Hayes) and Pete (Blaise Miller) Mandrake throw only the best Sunday brunches.  Yet this week's brunch is going to be a disaster.  Not only are they in the midst of their own full-blown marital crisis, but also some terrorists are about to detonate a series of nerve gas canisters across the United States, bringing about an end to life as we know it.  Will the quiche be too hot?  Will everyone like the wine?  Will they have to down it all before the end comes?  Oh, what's a couple of yuppies to do!Surprisingly, I thought IT'S A DISASTER missed more than a few of its marks.  That isn't to say that it's unfunny in any way, because that would be inaccurate.  It's just that, given the premise and the cast - including David Cross, Julia Stiles, America Ferrara, and more - I think I expected a bit more.  Many moments felt like they should've been played a bit bigger - a big more obtuse - and, instead, they're scaled back almost to the point that one wonders if everyone showed up knowing their lines.  Or was this a case of dialogue being manufactured on the set, and the players were only provided with the talking points?  It's hard to say, though I'd be remiss if I didn't underscore a bit of disappointment.There are some truly brilliant pieces in here.  Berger himself dons a hazmat suit and shows up uninvited to the dinner party as snooping neighbor, Hal; he's the one that breaks the news about the attacks.  Rachel Boston and Kevin M. Brennan are splendid as Lexi and Buck Kivel (respectively), a husband-and-wife team so completely comfortable with their own generous sexuality they want to share it with anyone they can (which almost includes David Cross's Glen in a wacky development).  And the occasional still shot of the dead latecomers to the party on the front steps - along with an assortment of dead crows - is increasingly funny as it's played so wondrously deadpan.  I can't help but wonder if IT'S A DISASTER started out as a stage play - all of the action takes place inside the house, though spread out across several rooms - but I've no doubt thinking that this is exactly the kind of film that when it gets remade will probably find a much bigger and much more appreciative audience.It's definitely worth a view.  Maybe not an owner.  But definitely worth a view.IT'S A DISASTER is produced by Vacationeer Productions, Attainment Media Group, ARM Entertainment (II), Gordon Bijelonic / Datari Turner Films, and Tip-Top Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled through Oscilloscope Laboratories.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds very solid, though there were a few instances when recording levels seemed a bit off.  Fans will be surprised to find a wealth of special features, including a commentary track and even a Comic-Con Panel appearance.  It's a nice assortment for a nice middle-of-the-road comedy.RECOMMENDED.  It's more benign comedy than it is outright farce, and, as a consequence, IT'S A DISASTER misses some of the true laughs because so much of it is underplayed.  Still, there's an awful lot of talent in there, so much so that I would've expected better.  This may've been the case of a writer/director being too close to the material to see the weaknesses in the performances; it could've used a few more manic highpoints - especially given the subject matter - and a little less routine shtick of twentysomethings trying to figure out who they are.  It's the apocalypse, after all?  Laugh it up, people!"
78993,"Used this in my truck and my car, it seems to be helping"
78994,Interesting characters and a good mystery. The UK TV mysteries tend to run longer than our 45 minute police procedurals and can pack in more about the characters and provide more depth to the story. The female lead  shows intellect and skills at handling being the only woman detective in the room.
78995,It's easy to use and is definitely needed for a new string musician. Good quality and ensures you are playing the chords correctly.
78996,"Given the cost of this unit itself plus the monthly feeding of propane and this turns into quite an expensive venture that only half works. I've been using it regularly for the past two months with little if any improvement in my yard. Unlike others, I had no problem in setup or DOA unit, all was fine. I have followed the instructions to a tee, but yet don't see a huge improvement, a slight one yes, but is it really worth the cost? I don't think so."
78997,Overall the story and progression have moved exceptionally well. Some parts I did not care for but overall the threads were woven together so well that I can leave things I did not like to the side of the road and enjoy the whole. looking forward to season 3.
78998,"I picked this movie because it looked lonely on Amazon instant watch.  Am I glad I did...? Not entirely.In a nutshell, this is the story of a lonely man who had three evenings in which he wasn't so lonely.On the positive side, this is a really sentimental tale.  The man is truly a tragic and sad character and I feel deeply for him after the movie.  He's the tragic and lonely nerd who spends all his time kicking about in his tiny apartment.  Thematically the movie has a lot to say about humanity.  Is it really better to have loved and lost or is it better to just stay in your one well-worn rut?  The scenario is sadly typical and many hearts are broken this way.To the negative.... this is NOT a fast-paced movie.  It's only an hour long but it does seem like not much really happens.  It's a few poignant moments and then it's gone.  Not a thriller by any means but one that threatens to make you feel exceptionally sorry for the main character.In summary, one to watch while you are NOT along kicking about in your apartment by yourself.  *ahem*  Because if you do that then it's just rather depressing.PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews. If you find my review helpful then great! If you do not, then please leave me a comment indicating what you want to know and I'll be sure to do better next time."
78999,"I bought these as a solution to obtain feedback while recording my guitar through my computer. That solution was successful. These speakers put out enough power that I can maintain the clarity of my guitar tone fairly well and achieve feedback almost as easily as i do with my amp. I have a 75Watt amp that powers a 12"" celestion speaker. These monitors have 70Watts powering a 5"" Woofer and a 1"" Tweeter, 40W/30W respectively. Slight drop in the power output, but they are beefy enough that I don't really notice.The isolation pads they come with are paper thin, almost pointless. If you really need some, get some more substantial pads. The back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours... not really concerned about that, but it's worth mentioning.They have great sound, excellent low end, lots of clarity throughout. They are pricey, but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon. I would really recommend not going to a retailer... even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online. Only go to a store just to hear them and compare them with other monitors."
79000,"I own a 2012 Wrangler (white) and I've removed all chrome and the hood logo was the last piece to go.  I replaced it with this black emblem, and it looks awesome.  Getting the old emblem off was really easy using a hair dryer and pliers (just to grab it since it was so freakin HOT).  It was a little work to get the adhesive off, but a little WD40 worked great for that.  Then I cleaned off the film from the WD40 with 409, and finally used an alcohol swab to prep the surface of the hood.The new emblem looks great.  I ordered two more, and plan to remove the Wrangler decal on the side of my jeep and replace them with these bad boys."
79001,"It's a good show without too much drama, so it's a good watch especially comparing it to regular t.v. At least this really happens."
79002,"I figure that this review will take a few weeks to complete, as I want to wait until I see the final results before I settle on a rating.With that said I spread Lawn Restore over my lawn this past weekend. I live on a quarter acre, and I would say that the Lawn Restore covered about 75% of lawn. Luckily the conditions were perfect, and we've had showers off and on over the past 3 days, with rain continuing today. According to the instructions, the lawn should be kept wet for a least four days after application, so I should be good to go.I will update when I see any change or growth.Update 1: It's been two weeks since spreading Lawn Restore, and I have to say that my lawn seems to be growing very lush and thick where I fertilized. I also notice that I don't have any weeds popping up where I spread the Lawn Restore, but have scattered dandelions where I was unable to spread the fertilizer.I will post another update in a week or two.Update 2: This will be the final update. The Lawn Restore did a solid job in thickening up my lawn where there were patches. The grass is thicker, the lawn more full where I laid down the fertilizer. I will say that the dandelions have spread to the fertilized area, so I'm not sure if this is what you would want for a week repellant, but it worked great on thickening up my grass."
79003,"When our grandson visits, there are some videos that we automatically play, but they are usually just noise while he is playing. He really watched the &#34;Wonder Pets&#34;. he watched them so much, we now have the theme song memorized. Cute but it has a good message on cooperation and asking for help when needed."
79004,directions a little off.....needed more wipes to clean the door jams...easy to install.....these should come from the factory on every jeep...
79005,The flying insect screens work wonderful.  After I installed them I did secure them  better using small draw-ties just to insure thatbugs or other critters would not get into the area.  Worked very well.  Never had any problem with them.  Would highlyrecommend
79006,"i am not a long time watcher of this show.  i am a good cook but until recently art was my passion, not cooking.  however, my husband and i both recently got high cholesterol readings plus he got a high blood pressure reading.  so i decided i needed to creatively intervene in our food. i thus cannot use all of the ingredients they use here but that is not why i watch.  i watch because everyone cooks like artists' create.  they start with an idea and build it from the ground up with their imaginations. they also present the finished dish as a work of art.  this all appeals to me.  shows with rigid use of recipes do not. i can look at recipes, get an idea of how a dish is done, but that is all.  i then create something of my own.  watching these chefs is thus identical to the way i've always worked.  i especially enjoyed the berry episode because i like combining berries in my cooking too.my criticisms are these:i don't like all of the interpersonal drama between the chefs.  a little of this would go a long way.  instead, we get a lot of it. i would prefer more closeup shots of the actual creating the food moments, including the chefs' correcting a nearly fatal error or failing to do so as that is the apex of the creative experience.i don't understand why the woman is in charge of this show (Padima). she is not a chef.  she has no credentials of any sort in any field as far as i can tell.  why is she judging food?  at least HEIDI KLUM models clothes which gives her SOME credibility in hosting and judging PROJECT RUNWAY. it doesn't sit well with me that she makes all of these hyper critical judging remarks when she has no culinary talent herself.  the other judges have a right to be so critical as they are top chefs throughout the country."
79007,Ron Swanson is the real star of this show. Amy Poehler is relentless in promoting her left wing agenda whenever possible. The show is getting tired.  Give Ron his own show !
79008,"What geek couldn't love this show? And with the excellent writing, you don't have to be a geek to enjoy it. It's a must see for me."
79009,"I've loved justified and Timothy Olyphant since it first aired. Looking forward to season 5. This marshal could go either way and he chose to be on the side of law. Sometimes you see that bad boy come out in him and know he's thinking, geez it would have been easier to be on the other side. Timothy Olyphant is perfect for the character he plays. He's just enough of a bad boy but so naive as to be trusting of strangers, especially women to get himself into heaps of trouble."
79010,I am glad that I listened to the other reviews for season one.  Season one does start off a bit slow but as you get entangled in the show and characters it is absolutely addicting.  I loved each episode and after season one it just gets funnier and funnier!  Definitely  continue watching even if you aren't hooked by the first few episodes... it's worth it! : )
79011,"It wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to its hype. It really could have been done better in my opinion."
79012,"I bought these to replace a bulb physically broken during disassembly for an unrelated project.  My headlights and fog lights had previously been converted to HID's and we've always enjoyed their performance.  With bulbs coming in all difference price ranges you wonder what makes one better than the other.  The ones I've seen 'appear' to have identical build quality despite wide price differences and these were no exception.Be careful when selecting the bulb to ensure you get the right one, but once they arrive the connectors should match what you already have, but perhaps there will be an extra/unneeded piece of a wire loom you'll need to remove, or a rubber boot which will need to be carefully cut away before installation.The higher the temperature of the bulb (8000k vs. 6000k vs. 6000k) the more the color tint of the light will change.  The temperature which best matches stock/legal color would be 5000-6000k, a more whitish light.  These at 8000k have a slight violet/bluish tint."
79013,"The clay bar works just fine, this is the first time i try clay bars, but it does work; i dont really like the detailer that much, ive tried turtle wax ice, and the platinum series and those are much better detailers.  with that aside i dont mean to say that this detailer spray wont work, it does, but ive tried better ones like the ones i mentioned above"
79014,These jack stands seem to be well made and I like the feature with the safety pin. I bought these to use on an old corvette and they are more than what is required for that purpose. I would have no problem using these on our chevy suburban.
79015,"extremely versatile.  the conical end pulls outward and functions as a ratchet, cranking the straps/clips taught.  A few minutes of one-time configuration/setup is needed and future mount/removals are accomplished in seconds.  The only reason i didn't give these a 5 star rating is the small foam discs tend to come off the mounting bases periodically (they press against the outside of your existing mirror).  Thoughtfully, the vendor includes extras.  All in all, a very unique and functional product!"
79016,"I didn't try it on many items, but I did try it on some interior trim and didn't see any difference."
79017,I used this to set about 28 cactus plants in new pots for the Spring season. It blended nicely with the Miracle Gro Perlite I bought at the same time. I use both products with play sand as a mix for my cactus plants and it works nicely. Thanks.
79018,"First off, in my own opinion, this wasn't quite as good as something like The Warrior's Way. What got my attention about this film was its primary theme of rebelling against tyranny- especially unstable tyranny. And a small group of people (normally, it's misfits, in this case it's samurai becoming assassins) that go out of their way to bring said tyrant down. For this first half of this film, it felt pretty slow with only a couple of action scenes that felt a bit too quick, though I guess I can let it slide with the disturbing image of a young woman with limbs severed off (I got to hand it to him, Takashi refuses to follow any cinematic rules, and this film furthers his stuff). The meatier violence, sadly, is closer to the end, just in the second half of the flick. And, just like in movie Detective Story, there's a shocking image of a nude boy... though he actually takes a leak, getting a lead samurai to smile in incredulity of the simplicity of small village life. But when the action does start, it's heavy hitting, nonstop, and completely jaw-dropping. Out of all the assassins, I'm inclined to like the last added one since he's quite the riot with his clumsiness and big mouth. The very last action scene seemed to also have the best philosophy in the movie, since it deals with the integrity and diginity of all man, including one's own enemy and reveals the total nonchalance and inhumanity of the main enemy in the film. When all's said and done, I couldn't help but smile at the conversation that goes on that ends this film."
79019,"What an incredibly imaginative show. I find myself believing it all makes perfect sense, even though I know it does not. I was incredibly, wonderfully surprised. This is one good show. It will steal your heart. Literally.So beware."
79020,Somebody really wanted this show to spell shield.  I've watched several episodes so far and it's a fun show.  I like the actors and the story thus far.  This series looks to be one follow-able for family viewing.
79021,Funny show Neil Patrick herest is the king and Jason Segal are what makes this show so great boom layered!!!
79022,I was very satisfied with the way the show ended. It ended on the right note. I will not give it away but the series was starting to waffle in it's direction. It was back on track in the end and the last episodes tied up a lot of loose ends and I felt it was finished. Those who have collected the sets all along will enjoy it. I just finished a marathon sessoin of the complete 4 seasons and feel it was time well spent.
79023,"I enjoyed these thought provoking stories.  Not sure I believe them, but it is fun and interesting to entertain all possibilities of what happens before and after we are in this current body and life."
79024,"One aspect of gardening that most people have forgotten about is rotating your crops. If you grow the same thing in the same place every year, you are drawing the same nutrients out of the soil every year. Miracle Gro Garden Soil is one way to restore those nutrients to your garden. It also loosens your soil, improves it moister retention and provides 3 moths of plant food to the plants growing in it.This is what you need if you plant a garden every year to insure your garden grows to its full potential."
79025,"This totally lacks the fun of the first movie. The second movie really strained the concept and was also not as good as the first, but it was much better than this one. It has some great cameos but they are very poorly done. If you love the Hatchet movies, watch it, but don't expect much. They need to either find their original creative and fun spark, or STOP, PLEASE!"
79026,"We're fans of White Collar, so we look forward to each new series we download. (We don't subscribe to cable TV, so we select two TV series to watch each year, in addition to watching some films or specials.  This series is one of the two.)  The writers haven't disappointed us yet, although the running theme that Neal and his FBI handler, Peter, will never learn to trust each other is getting a bit old. In the true story behind the film, &#34;Catch Me If You Can,&#34; the FBI agent and his criminal informant worked well together, remaining good friends even after retirement.  But, I suppose that without the tension of mutual distrust in a running series, the series would run out. So, due to the likeable characters, plots twists, and continuing questions to be resolved, we keep coming back to watch."
79027,This 30W non-detergent oil is what you should use in your 4 cycle lawn mower or garden tractor.I have a garden tractor with a 26 HP Kohler engine and this 48oz is exactily how much the engine uses when you change the oil and filter. I like not having left over new oil. That lets me use the container for the used oil.  Ordering was convenient and shipping was fast.
79028,"Purchased this shed recently at Home Depot as it was a little cheaper even with tax. Went together fairly easy. It is very light so I lined the floor with cement stepping stones which made it very secure. Cut shelving to fit and it was good to go. I use it to store my Weber rotisserie, all other barbecue gear and a lot of garden products. For a small storage shed its perfect for me and it frees up space in my garage!"
79029,Now I am going to have to watch this series cuz I'm hooked and I have to see what is going to happen to all the characters.
79030,"99 cents for 10 minutes or less, interesting concept ""what if superman's ship had landed in Russia and he grew up under that type of totalitarian regime"" -- but you only get a few minutes of story and the rest in screen credits, not worth 99 cents"
79031,"My Perky Pet Water cooler is too small for all but the smallest of birds to sit on the ledge while drinking.  There is no stabilization so it swings back and forth as soon as a bird does land on it, consequently the bird flies off because it's swinging.  You have to take it completely down to fill and then screw off the bottom which is where the birds poop is. I wouldn't recommend this product just because you have to get it down from the tree, and then touch bird excrement and then the birds don't use it anyway because it sways and is just too small. Mine did not come with a hook to hang it so you'll have to find your own S hook or string to hand it with."
79032,"Better Off Ted is outrageously funny. Great acting, witty banter, crazy ideas, and not-too-far-fetched corporate scenarios make this a very entertaining series to watch."
79033,"I watched all seasons, and then have come back to watch it again. The ensemble is great, and Holly Hunter is stellar! Love the writing, the acting, the cast, the stories, and the interweaving of Earl, the angel, and Grace the tough cop with a huge heart. I really like Oklahoma City as the setting; it's my part of the country, and the Texas/OU rivalry is handled beautifully. It is more than just another police drama. Some theological and philosophical, social and cultural dilemmas are included. Great show!"
79034,I'm addicted! Binge watched yesterday to catch up and am now in Season 4.
79035,"Dang this was only part 1, talk about dramatic. Certainly violence is never the answer but some people provoke and that's Kenya. It is time for Kenya to be off the show but at the same time she's very entertaining. They better not kick Porsha off, others from the housewives chain have been in physical disagreements and they're still on the show.Also, Kenya needs to get real with pressing charges against Porsha, get a life and accept her blame in that altercation.  Kenya will never though because she is a professional at playing the victim."
79036,"These cables are good quality and they include a storage bag - a good value for the money. I purchased a set for each one of my kids' cars. The storage bag could have been a bit heavier, but it is sufficient."
79037,Very good for a quick tune up. Might be a little to tight for checking intonation. Very fast readout and fast on off.
79038,"From the moment you touch the package, you'll begin to wonder if this came from a dollar store. It has that knockoff look and feel that you just don't see in mainstream stores.And once you have the ""flare"" out of the packaging, you'll probably notice how it's about ready to crack before you even screw on the battery cap. You may even notice (or be disturbed by) the similar look this has to a more adult-oriented item.But hey, the box says it's a super-bright LED that's as good as a flare, right? Well, that's not so true. The dopey LED isn't very bright at all. If this is as bright as a flare, then a MagLite is as bright as the sun. I wrote it off to the crazy no-name AAA batteries and tried some fresh Duracells. Same result.But... but... it says it has a map light, too! Indeed, it does. Hopefully, there's nothing red on your map, because the ""map light"" is that same dopey red LED -- but not blinking. And really, that's something to give some serious thought to. If it was really that bright, would they suggest you use it as a map light? I think not.If anything, I'd think that using this as a road flare is more likely to confuse drivers than warn them. In fact, the only useful application this has that I can think of, is using the loophole to tie it to your kid on Halloween. That is, if you're angry with your kid and want to shame them with something that's not even as bright as a Glow Stick.Paying more than the cost of a candy bar for this is pure insanity."
79039,"It works well as a standard clutch, as a drop clutch its very iffy.  the top part spins around when you hit the lever so you have to grab it and move it back so you can hit it again."
79040,"When I saw the advertisements on TV for this show, I wasn't really interested in watching it.  But one night I decided to watch this on my Kindle to see if I thought it was funny.  The next thing I know, I'm binge watching it and telling my sisters and friends about it.  I didn't think my husband would be interested in it at all, but he would hear me laughing and began to ask what I was watching.  He wanted to start watching it.  I had just finished all the episodes available!  So we began at the beginning and now he's laughing every night as well.  He usually dreads watching &#34;chick flick&#34; types of shows with me, but he thinks it's one of the funniest shows ever made.  So I give it 5 stars - I'd give more if it were an option!  Laughter is the best medicine and we watch these episodes - 3 or 4 per night - right before bed so we have laughter in our thoughts and not the evening news!!"
79041,"This capo is small, looks good, and works very well.  It is well protected to not scratch or nick your guitar."
79042,I tower out at 5'7&#34; which is not considered tall when it comes to working on or retrieving items from the bed of my 4x4 truck. This came in a nice carrying case that stores well behind the front seats in my truck without scratching anything. I have put on the front tire trying out the fit and it will work well .
79043,"not high quality, but has cut dolphin detailing on the tuners, just as described, works like it should, good or begginers"
79044,"I've been playing guitar for over 30 years both teaching & performing and never used a pedalboard. I used to carry the FX's in a briefcase and setup the ones I needed. I'm old school when it comes to these boxes... I run compression, wah, overdrive, super-overdrive, delay & reverb pretty much in that order. Sometime I use a phaser or a tremolo... I also have a few distortion pedals laying around as well but don't use them much. I currently have 8 pedals setup on this board. I have room for one maybe two more. The board itself is built like a tank and travels well. The bag that comes with it is road worthy for local gigs but I wouldn't take it on tour without a metal case. I did go ahead and Velcro down all the pedals that I always use leaving a little room for add ins. Be sure you want to Velcro down the FX chain because to get the best, most secure, it won't fall off the board when you pick it up off the floor...I found that I had to remove all the rubber feet from each pedal. The Velcro is very strong and may test the durability of some of your cheaper pedals. Use great care when removing them from the board as you can easily rip the backs off of some of them. Low end wah pedals and boxes made out of plastic be warned....Boss, MXR, Mod Tone and other high end, well made pedals work best once set on the board. You can run any number of power sources to it. There is plenty of room for all my needed connections...I leave the choice of that to you the reader.At the end of the day it's easier for me to move my FX pedals around and setup on the gig is in minutes. Plus it looks much cleaner and gives me a little more room on tiny stages and less chance of tripping over a cable.. I'm very happy with this product and would replace it should anything happen to it."
79045,My mother has a habit of stealing my picks so I always order from them. They always give me good picks to use.
79046,I dont get it but my girl loves it and its clean entertainment for young kids. She loves the &#34;whats gonna work? teamwork&#34; song which actually inspires her to work with others to get tasks done and I love that.
79047,"This little trap is so light and flimsy feeling that I was sure I'd made a mistake in purchasing it.  But so far, I'm pleased. It is very easy to set. The first time I tried to set it, I thought parts were missing. I re-read the instructions and was incredulous by the way the trap door is held open. I thought it could not work. I thought that it would not hold and the door would drop down as the slightest vibration or wind. So far, that has not happened. I've caught at least one critter (squirrels, chipmunks) each day. For irresistible bait, I mix cheap peanut butter with oatmeal, form into a thin pancake, freeze then crumble. I put some crumbs inside at the back of the trap and some in front of and just inside the entrance. Works every time. If you catch squirrels, you need to transport them at least 12 miles from your yard or they will find their way back. This is what I was told by the cooperative extension office."
79048,"I wasn't  sure what to  expect  from this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. The acting is superb . James purefoy is awesome as the main character. A must see!"
79049,"I bought these thinking they were the normal sized BIG stubby picks, obviously they weren't. They're as sturdy as the BIG ones just a bit too small to be comfortable for me. I still think Amazon or whoever else could have been a bit clearer with the product information, but it's still not too bad."
79050,"This is a very simple boost with a small footprint that fits nicely on the pedal board ... I like the simplicity and the ability to set the dip switches to my liking ... I find that with humbucker pickups it adds just the right, very slight tone coloration that both fattens up the sound and gives it just the right sparkle ... I don't use it much with single coils since they don't seem to benefit as much from the coloration or the treble boost ... it is a good pedal to have on board when you need that little something extra to get the right tone ... built solid ... a quality pedal that should hold up well ..."
79051,Enjoyable entertaining show with clever ending sequence.  I am surprised it got cancelled considering the quality of things that do.  Dan
79052,We love this show and watched both seasons and are now watching the current season on TV.  It's one of our favorite shows.
79053,"The pad I used last year held up for three polishes, but this year's pad broke down after only one polish.  I wonder if it had to do with the fact I used the one-step sealant this year as opposed to separate polish and wax?  I use these with griot's random orbital."
79054,"When we first received the Perky-Pet Feeder we immediately filled it with seeds and hung it up. We watched and did notice a few birds visiting, however they appeared to land on the feeder, look around for a minute or two and then leave.  This went on for about 2 weeks.  It seemed that the birds were confused about the plastic disc which is the squirrel slammer located near the bottom.  We moved our new feeder to another site on our property where we've had feeders for several years. That did the trick!  Goldfinch and other small birds started to arrive and those that didn't know where the seeds came from, caught on rather quickly as they watched Cardinals, Wrens, Downy Woodpeckers and other small birds feeding. In fact, we've had more birds coming at the same time than we've ever had before. We watch from our glass enclosed garden room and are entertaing ourselves as well as visiting friends.Our yard is starting to look like a bird sanctuary!!!"
79055,"Read the reviews and had to try for myself on my new car.  Works GREAT!  Easy on, Easy off. Great protection, water just beads off. Can apply in hot sun, easy buff off to hi-quality shine. So easy, you don't mind applying again later for added protection(2nd coat). When dirty, rinse car with waterhose(if water doesn't bead up, time to apply Liquid Glass again, usually last more than 2months) and dry off with microfiber clothes."
79056,"&lt;strong>The Shrine&lt;/strong> (Jon Knautz, 2010)&lt;em>The Shrine&lt;/em>, the second feature from &lt;em>Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer&lt;/em> director Knautz, was actually a lot better than I thought it would be; after all, it came from the guy who gave the world &lt;em>Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer&lt;/em>. Which is not to say it's a mind-numbingly great movie, but as far as being a run-of-the-mill supernatural horror flick set in Eastern Europe, it holds its own well enough.Plot: three investigative journalists (&lt;em>Smallville&lt;/em>'s Aaron Ashmore, &lt;em>Supernatural&lt;/em>'s Cindy Sampson, and &lt;em>Chloe&lt;/em>'s Meghan Heffern) travel deep into the Eastern European countryside to substantiate claims of a human sacrifice in a remote village. When they get there, they find things are a bit more complicated than that--but that may not stop them from becoming the next victims.It's actually a pretty fun little movie, with a decent effects budget (that was well-used) and a script that aimed at turning a lot of horror-movie clich&eacute;s on their collective head. One more rewrite to come up with inventive ways around a few nasty plot holes would have been a good thing, and I wasn't terribly convinced by a lot of the acting; this is what happens when you try to lure teen audiences by pulling from CW shows. Still, horror aficionados who are sick of the same old thing may want to give this one a whistle, because even if it's predictable, it's at least going to take the predictability into the opposite side of the playground each time it can. ***"
79057,"I get a number of different bird species with woodpeckers being my favorite. This suet, as many others have noted doesn't hold together very well. You have to be extremely gentle with it when taking it out of the package or it falls apart. Aside from that, the birds like it, and it's reasonably priced."
79058,"I've been needing a new skimmer for quite some time but could never remember to go by a pool supply store.  I finally decided to check out Amazon and was pleased to find I could get one here - Prime even!  My current skimmer is a basket style which is really nice when you are picking up lots of leaves, but I found it a problem when a turtle was found swimming around.  It scooped it up nicely, but folded over on itself when I tried to drop the turtle over the fence (there is a field behind me).  So, my decision was to get this one for leaves as well asHydrotools 8039 Professional Heavy Duty Leaf Skimmerfor when I am picking up turtles or anything else I want to send over the fence.As has been noted, the frame is plastic and the net seems to be a plastic mesh.  They have been fused together.  I'm not sure how long it will be for there to be a separation, but I don't have high expectations for any of these nets.  Fortunately, it is reasonably priced, even if it makes it through only one season."
79059,Project runway is an advertising reality TV show about fashion. The episodes are scripted as are the judges' comments and indeed all of the dialogue and drama. It exists mainly to promote fashion products with the illusion of huge prizes. It's basically a chick show abounding with fantasy.
79060,"I bought these because they were LIGHT weight to replace jack stands and a jack for oil changes and such maintenance jobs on my sportscar.  With a 3-4&#34; clearance the car goes up these with no issue.  The tires are 245/45/18.. and fit fine.I would say these weigh about 10-15lbs at best.. if you've used steel ramps, or a decent jack and stands you'll greatly appreciate the weight difference immediately.. and frankly driving up two ramps is safer and easier/quicker for oil changes,.. and any other work that needs about 1-2 feet of clearance.Buy them if you do your own oil changes."
79061,"My son and I enjoyed the show,  it was interesting and we would watch more it.  Would be fun to see them solve a crime."
79062,"I cannot believe they are canceling this show, given its high ratings, excellent writing, and excellent actors, it is just a shame and a waste.  Each season is better than the last."
79063,What is there to say?  Comes with 5 for the spare.  Kind of sucks they never include a spare wheel key.
79064,"I love this show because it is detective, funny and real all at once. It is a very addicting show to watch."
79065,"It has an interesting premise, and Tambor is very good, but the adult children are all so self-centered and unlikable that I can't imagine wanting to spend much time with them. Two other observations: This is labeled a &#34;comedy,&#34; but the pilot was 99 percent drama, one percent humor. Also, there's a lot of nudity, but I can't recall the last time I saw so many attractive, naked young actors photographed in such an unflattering manner."
79066,"This show just gets better. The mystery of the Doctor's new companion makes for a compelling story arc and these episodes are packed with drama, excitement, and humor. And are more than a little mind-bending. All you can ask from Doctor Who."
79067,This show was sad. The acting was horrid. The dialogue sounded like it was written by a high school student. Plus the plot is tired. Aren't there already enough shows and movies out there about the apocalypse??? This was definitely one of the worst that I have seen. A complete waste of 54 minutes.
79068,"This is a handy cage, lightweight and easy to set up and move around.  In my case, though, I think it will be better suited to being a pepper support than a tomato support.  I grow indeterminate tomatoes inEarthBoxes, and they get very tall and very bushy.  This cage worked well while they were smaller, but before long it did not support their weight or height well.  I had to lash it to the deck railing.  There also weren't enough cross braces to tie all of the bushy branches to the cage.  However, the EarthBox also does a phenomenal job with peppers, and I think it will work well with those."
79069,"I disagree with all the nay sayers out there,the new addition to the NCIS cast, which is now sans Ziva as it was sans the first female, is a good and different fit. Now I know the others think it is not a good change, but again I must disagree. Elle  is a complete change from the previous two female characters, and the shows plots should be and are so far, as interesting as they ever were. I believe in time she may well be the kick in the pant's the show needed. Very much recommended, what the hell give her and the new direction a chance! Only time will tell, yes....."
79070,"If it isn't, it's pretty darn close. Supernatural just gets better and better with each passing season. I just watched the third episode of season four last night on TV and it looks like the current season is heading in the right direction. This is the only great show the CW has ever produced. Most people make fun of the network, but I bet they haven't watched this show. It has good acting (the two leads are very likeable), clever and often funny writing, very good special effects, a classic rock soundtrack and a well thought out storyline. Not to mention all the different hot babes that pop up almost every week.Supernatural gets a lot of involvement from the writers and directors of the The X-Files and it shows in it's quality. If your a horror and action fan like me, you won't find any show on TV better than this. Okay, maybe Dexter, but that's more thriller than horror."
79071,"This was a gift for a friend, along with a Weber Q,  and it's rolling stand.  I have not personally used it, but my friend is raving about the BBQ.  He set the unit up right out of the boxes,  and began cooking.  He is an ex-professional chef, and loves the set."
79072,"I used to watch this show a while ago, the first two seasons.  Viewing it as a therapist, it is a sad show and not really that funny."
79073,I bought three of these because of an outstanding rating in the largest rating magazine.  A real plus is that it reads up to 150 lbs. which is great for truck/RV tires.  You will love this tire guage.
79074,"I can have fun learning Chinese. When a problem comes, The solution comes in Kai-lan`s head. You can also have fun learning Chinese."
79075,"We love them all, the only down side is they did not release the whole season (not an amazon problem).  If you are a Dr. WHo fan you will not be disappointed."
79076,"I normally tune to drop f on my 8 string, but even in standard, I just cant stand the strobe, and theres no other mode. I ordered a pitch black for $70. Im still waiting on the return for this."
79077,"I wish all T.V. shows were this much fun! You learn as you have a good time, and it always gives you a good laugh, no matter what your age!"
79078,"I got sick of using my &#34;Common&#34; funnel for different uses, trying to clean up an oily funnel so you can use it for Sea Foam is just dumb when you can get these for a little more than $1.  The size/length is perfect for gas-tank additives.  I purchased 3, I keep one in the garage to pour Sea Foam into my cara/motorcycle/snow-blower/lawnmower.  And the other 2 I keep in whatever vehicle I'm currently using, in my &#34;just in case&#34; pack.Great product."
79079,"Season 2 was good, definitely better than season 3 but not as good as season 1.  I feel that I learned more about micro expressions threw watching this show.  Thank you to the creator of this show for providing an easier medium for me to learn about micro expressions."
79080,"All  major  filters were analyzed by an independent source; they were cut apart and rated on which filter had  the best construction and Purolator PureOne was  not the best filter, but the best value, because the better filters cost twice as much."
79081,"IHAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO USE THIS MUCH BUT THE ONE TIME I DID, IT DIDN'T HOLD. I TRULY THINK THESE TYPES OF THINGS SIMPLY DO NOT SHIP WELL DURING THE WINTER MONTHS. IT SEEMS KIND OF WATERY."
79082,"ASSEMBLY: First you have to attach the high pressure grease hose to the head of the gun, making sure you use the supplied copper gasket before tightening down. Then, you have to attach your inlet coupler to the bottom of the handle, making sure that you use teflon plumbers tape on the coupler threads.INSTALLING GREASE CARTRIDGES: First, remove the pump head from the grease cylinder. Second, pull the grease loader (Also called follower) all the way back and then lock it into place. The side which has the simple pull off cap, that end goes into the grease cylinder. Then you pull off the sardine like lid, and then screw down the pump head onto the grease cylinder. Then you release the grease loader.PRIMING: Every time you install a new grease cartridge, you have to prime the gun. The quick way to prime, is to operate the gun slowly, until grease flows out of the coupler. If that does not work, you may have air pockets in the system. The manual recommends that you open the filler valve on the pump head by two turns out, holding the gun with the discharge hose pointing up. Then you close the filler valve once the air has been removed.OPERATING: To operate, attach the coupler at the end of the high pressure hose, to a zerk fitting. As you depress the trigger, air enters the chamber, which pushes the piston with the plunger. The grease that is under pressure from the plunger, opens the check valve and delivers one shot of lubricant. The more you depress the trigger, the faster this process operates, thus increasing grease flow. The gun is designed to have a full speed limit, as to limit damage to bearing seals and dust boots.EXPERIENCE: I think this gun weighs a bit much, but it has to be constructed of durable metals, in order for it to be commercial built. The body of the gun is constructed of a durable metal. The handle has a really nice rubber grip that I like, while the trigger is made of plastic. On both ends of the high pressure hose, heavy duty springs can be found. These springs are used to make sure the hose doesn't kink, I find they kind of get in the way, but I can get used to them, just have to have a good grip on the hose is all.I find its best to just let the bottom of the gun rest against the ground, this way you don't have to hold the weight for long periods of time. I like the 30"" HP hose on this gun a lot more then the 17"" hose on my old gun, as it allows me to get deeper into a place that has a grease zerk. Using this gun is so easy! All I have to do is press on the trigger a little bit, and grease will automatically be pumped into the grease fittings. No more hand fatigue, and no more useless time wasted, trying to fill the fitting with grease.One of the things I like that Lincoln Industrial did, is they incorporated their cover cap, into this gun as well! This is a great option, because when you are done using the gun, you can slide the cap onto the end of the coupler, keeping the grease from getting contaminated by dirt.CONCLUSION: This is the best grease gun I have ever bought! Not only is it made by a awesome brand like Lincoln Industrial, but its extremely durable. Despite a few of the negatives, I really like this gun. I can tell I am going to get a lot more use out of this gun, then my old one. This gun is not necessary for the home-owner per say, but is absolutely necessary for any small engine or automotive shop. 5 out of 5"
79083,"This sunshield does exactly as advertised!  I have to agree with a few of my fellow campers, that the Velcro fasteners come off as they heat up.  A person might have to secure them with a screw in to the door, and some hot melt glue or similar on the shade itself. I recommend this as it works and definitely keeps the hot sun rays outside."
79084,I bought this as it looks alot different than normal hummingbird feeders and offered a different style that I thought would be a great eyecatcher.  I read though that if your feeder doesnt have alot of red it wont atract hummingbirds.  This doesnt have really any red on it as the bottle is blue and the flowers are a reddish bronze color.  The feeder seems to be working ok with atracting hummingbirds though as we have already had a few come to it at first.  We also have now tied some red ribbon bows around the handle to try to atract more closer to the feeder so they will then see the flowers.  We have just put in a sugar water mixture and the seem to really enjoy it so far.  We will see hw the red ribbons work and if they seem to atract more.  I like the look of this but really think that a red bottle might atract hummingbirds more often.
79085,"Violence, Sex, & some roughly based history, what is not to like about ROME?If you love spear and sandal movies this is one for you, its not as good as the newer Spartacus: Blood and Sand  but it is well worth watching. The story is believable, the acting is good, and there is fun action and adventure in it.As we keep stating; Violence, sex, & some roughly based history, what is not to like about ROME?"
79086,"I thought the premise was kind of trying to play off Homeland (American traitors living among us, etc.).I really didn't think it was that good and probably won't watch any more episodes."
79087,Really boring film with empty relationships and a very few interesting though strange moments. I think there might have been about 15 minutes total of mildly interesting content. Otherwise this film was a waste of time.
79088,There's a product being pushed on TV right now that claims to fix your old dingy headlights. Looked too good to be true so I checked it's reviews on Amazon and found the overall consensus was that it did not work. This 3M product showed up under suggested items and the reviews were good so I purchased it. To my amazement it took my cloudy yellowed 1997 Subaru headlights and made them look brand new! It was easy to do and the instruction video was all I needed to accomplish the task.(The print on the paper instructions was too small to read). My drill is a variable speed drill but it is not the kind that has a limiter on it. A bit tricky trying to keep it between 1200 and 1600 rpm.I could not be more impressed with the outcome of my lenses. Now I can see at night and I don't have to drive with my brights on.
79089,"Worked great for my 14000 lb trailer.  Way better than jack stands, as these allow for slight adjustments to ensure you're totally balanced."
79090,"The last digital tire gauge I bought was programmable, but was really hard to use. This one doesn't have any special functionality. It just gives you a good reading and is easy to use. It does feel a bit flimsy though. The more expensive ones feel heavier and will probably last longer but if you just want to know your current tire pressure this is the best digital one I've found. I bought three and put them in my wife and daughter's cars and now they regularly check their pressure as well. With gas prices as high as they've been keeping the correct tire pressure is a no brainer..."
79091,"I like it, it works great and adds extra convenience, I would buy this item again.  Good price also on this item."
79092,"I've seen the mouse so I know there is one. After about a week we finally got the beep and red light but apprently they got away or something else caused it to go off.I like the design, shape and ease of use. It takes 4 D cell batteries. Has a convenient on and off switch plus 2 LEDs. Green comes on for a second after you turn on the switch to let you know it is on. Red is supposed to be when you have a catch.If we ever catch one I'll update this review."
79093,"The reality of the concept is scary.  Private funding is always what makes best supposed fiction.  The individuals that shared their concept of missing people etc... made a valid point, which made the show a dazzling concept."
79094,This stuff works great.  I used it on yesterday for the first time and I must say it is fantastic on my tires it leaves a nice sheen on the tires not overly shiny but nice and neat (no sling off ).  The product is thicker than most tire dressings and it stays where you apply it .I will be using these SONAX products a lot more in the future.
79095,"Strung these up on my LP Goldtop with P-90's.D'Addario promises these strings to be ""comprised of mathematically optimized string gauge combinations"" that result in ""greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings.""I dunno anything regarding the science behind this, but the main difference in gauge seems to be slightly thicker A and D strings compared to the regular set of D'Addario 10s they offer.  Its not a huge huge difference, but the strings are fairly unique in their feel and performance.For one thing, they're pretty stiff.  They bend, but not easily.  Maybe that's what they mean by ""Balanced tension.""  They're also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated 10s.  Not flatwound mellow, by any means, but not quite as bright as your regular set of 10s.  I do get a great rock tone out of them, mind you, but you may be taken aback at first by their slightly darker sound.  Personally, I like the tone I get out of them, they're big and warm without being dull sounding, but again, your preferences might differ.One thing that's GREAT about these strings is, once they're properly stretched, they stay in tune FOREVER!  Again, maybe this is part of the ""balanced tension,"" and if so, good job D'Addario.I haven't had them on forever to really see how long they last, but they've been on for two weeks and sound just as good as day one.Who would these appeal to?  Well, if you like really light strings that bend easily, you're not going to like these.  If you're a rythm player who does long gigs, the tuning stability and big warm sound mean these are for you!"
79096,"I already have several Strathwood pieces so I was excited to add these for additional outdoor seating. The chairs come (2)to a very large but lightweight box. The box is easy to open and there was adequate yet minimal packaging, so they were easy to get out of the box, remove packaging, and set up within ten minutes. I have the matching sofa and even after almost a year the sofa cushions still look new despite sitting outside (covered area). I have placed a small table in between these chairs and find them to be more comfortable than the sofa. Previously I had (2) white rockers that I battled mildew with. This plastic wicker is mildew resistant and washes so easily when needed. I highly recommend these!"
79097,This is a great tool for getting under the car for the occasional oil change. The only grip I have is that there is no place for tools to be held but other than that it is quite useful. The padding is thick and comfortable and the headrest keeps the strain off the neck for the longer processes.
79098,"Little Bill continues to exemplify what a good, educational children's program should be. I only wish that it was still running."
79099,I leave this scoop right in the compost barrel and have it handy when I need it most.  Never rusts and it is perfect.
79100,I personally think there are better family and educational cartoon shows out there for young children. This isn't a program that is watched very often at our house.
79101,Synthetic is a good investment...Royal Purple is an old name ...is it better ...I have no idea; I just wanted the best for my car.
79102,"Great show, action packed, never boring, amazing acting.  Time is precious, this show is worth the time you spend watching."
79103,I find this series both informative and controversial.  Its very interesting to learn about our ancient past and be presented withtheories about extraordinary happenings of the time. I have certainly open my mind to these theories and even if you don't care about the ancient alien aspect of the series. Its still has a lot of good information about civilizations from thousands of years ago.
79104,"Once again, glee was adorable. They are doing well this season with the dreaded high school to college transition for some of their characters. The music, of course, rocked."
79105,took it camping and was real handy in recharging my iPad and phone. Haven't used anything bigger on it but small electronics worked fine.
79106,"Better & brighter than standard bulb, no heat, less draw on battery, use on a scooter.Only time will tell on quality."
79107,This is my favourite oil for my 1998 shadow aceJASO MA approvedClass 3 fully synthetic oil.&#34;Stout' oilCheap to boot.Thank you amazonOnly complain is that it is only made available to the USA.
79108,"I doubt you can beat this for $25! The uke is a solid little guy.  I shimmed the bridge a little because I can play hard, but it wasn't bad. Pretty well in tune up the neck.  Strings are ok but I do have some Aquilas to put on; will see if it matters much.The tuners ARE geared, not friction like in the one picture --- at least, mine are.The carrying bag is just that, with no padding or other protection, but keeps the rain off."
79109,"The trimmer comes with 2 batteries and a super tiny, lightweight charger.The batteries hold a long charge; at fully charged, they're good enough for 20-35 minutes of trimming, good enough to do the borders of a 30m^2 garden.The trimmer is lightweight too, very easy to handle, and comfortable.The only 2 cons are:1- It's meant for people upto 6' (larger people may have to bend forward a bit, or click up the handle a bit)2- To extend the string, one has to remove the red cover on the bottom of the trimmer. On my Ryobi there was a button to extend the string, but with this one, you'd practically have to demount the head, and halfway take out the coil. It's not really thought through.The overall looks are for budget and practicality, it's definitely not feeling like a solid trimmer, the plastic plates seem somewhat cheap, but they are definitely functional.It definitely beats buying only a fraction better device for more than twice the price!In my estimation, the device will last a long time. The batteries probably a good 4 years.Next time I'll get a gas powered one, as these batteries are great for the short term, not the longer term."
79110,"I have 2 of theses and I get lots of hummers! You must keep them ant free and clean and the hummers will come for food! Be sure to change the food often, especially if they are in the sun."
79111,"I am not a big user of flanger and my only comparison is with the flanger that is in the Boss ME 70 multi-effects pedal. This unit sounds good and is adjustable. It appears to give a few db boost whether or not you want it. There is no apparent degradation of signal when not in use. There is no &#34;subtle&#34; setting on the flanger, and so when it is on you know it. I think it is pretty cool and I mostly use it on my Fenders when I looking for heavy rock sound with overdrive.."
79112,"Worked well so far with my 99 Jeep XJ. I don't do hardcore off-roading with this Jeep, but it is driven mostly on dirt/logging roads and this steering stabilizer has performed fine so far."
79113,This works great with the Mustang I amp.  Switches between to preset channels with just a tap of the foot.  A great addition to an already great amp.  At this price it's kinda like the amp itself-  a no brainer!
79114,Fit in my Silverado great and look even better! Definitely a great oem replacement bulb to modernize any vehicle! Very bright.
79115,I purchased two of these for my 1997 Ford F1 50. Both did not work the company sent me a replacement one it also did not work. When I asked again to return this product they stated to me that I could not as too much time had passed. I feel that they sent me a useless item to set me up while waiting for time to run out. In the end I have three remotes that do not work and am out the money. I wish I would have not purchased this.
79116,"This fourth season of 13 does not disappoint. A sinister evil is unleashed on our Warehouse protectors and only a few members are aware of this dark danger. Again, great sets, great directing and producing, great acting and great fun...Well done!Richie"
79117,Did not make it look like paint was wet i personaly use magualers. I like the wet look from that
79118,"I layered this on top of Colinite Insulator Wax (which is the easiest wax to use ever), and it beads like crazy. Preferred method is to apply a second coat a day later (garaged) but since I don't have a garage, I applied two coats right after each other. Like any other wax, if you don't prepare the paint properly (correction and clay) you won't get the benefits. I recommend getting the red round foam applicator from chemical guys, my applicator (typical kind) had an edged seam around it and it kept getting chunks of wax stuck to it.  The biggest issue I see is that when applying it sets very quickly and you cannot distribute it any longer as soon as it starts to dry. You have to work in 1' by 1' areas, any larger and it doesn't spread out like it should. What I did enjoy, is that once you apply it, you don't have to keep &#34;working&#34; it into the paint. Overall, it's foolproof, but I felt like a little doesn't go a long way. As for the depth of shine and the &#34;glow&#34; afterwards, I've seen a wetter shine from using Meguiars paint sealant, but this will last longer than Meguiars which is interesting. Perhaps using this on its own or over JetSeal would yield better results. I loved a streak-free shine on my 2 stage black SUV."
79119,"There are a lot of reviews on here, and I have to say I am surprised at the number of 5-stars for Season 5.  Seasons 1-4 are the pinnacle of modern cop shows.  This show actually thinks about competing with NYPD Blue in the pantheon of great cop shows.  That's high praise, at least from me.  Of course, Southland follows the contemporary formula of upping the violence levels to ultra-realistic and disturbing heights--yet it has always done so in service to the story.  Either it was realistic and largely unexplored in the genre, so they explored it.  Or it was disturbing, and it affected or corrupted a character, so it served the story--and it was done well, even if it was ugly.  But it worked--and the gritty realism, whether the f-bombs (unbleeped on the DVDs) or the violence, were always used in service to the story, which was generally a show about heroes doing terrifying work and still living their personal lives out around it, even if they were flawed or the work itself ate them up.As a tremendous fan of the show, I went into Season 5 excited and ready for more.They lost &#34;it,&#34; in my opinion.  Characters went too far and were driven by a storyline, but it wasn't what this character would have done a season ago.  I could take that, because sometimes people just make stupid mistakes, but it was part of a pattern of pushing the envelope just for pushing the envelope's sake. At one point, the show just went and did a terrifying episode that was monumentally gripping but pushed the thing over into almost the horror/thriller genre rather than cop show.  It may have even been realistic, but it was clearly the shock-value driving the story, and, at this point in Season 5, the show was driving somewhere I didn't want to go anymore.I finished it out as it aired, hoping things would level out, but it ended on a sour note, and there's no resolving things with no Season 6.  But, with where the writing went, I may have skipped another season of this show anyway.  I never checked to see if the writers changed or if the show was being given notes from the network to be even more over-the-top so TNT could out-do other cable shows that went for shock value, but I really suspect that's what happened here and where the show went off the rails a bit.All that stated, if you like the shock-value shlock stuffed into otherwise decent shows, you might still like this season.  If I was going to recommend a cop show to someone, Southland would still be among the top shows on the list, easily.  But I would really only recommend seasons 1-4 and tell someone not to ruin things with Season 5.  I'm sure it had it's moments, but they really were not worth the less appealing parts, and Season 5 overall is not the way I want to remember the show."
79120,"I detailed for 12 years and have used and loved Meguiars, Griotts garage, Mothers and all the cheap brands and professional brands i have heard of. And while this stuff doesnt necessarily shatter expectations i would say it performed as good if not better in some categories than anything else ive used.#1- It sud'sed(?) up very nicely on par with griots garage at half the price.#2- it smelled great... i know i know not a big deal but hey it does#3-The suds lasted longer without refreshing in the bucket than anything else i have used#4- i did not have to go over some spots on my white car like i did with meguiars gold class soap#5- the price is great and not much product was needed."
79121,I purchased this charger because I termed it 'smart' because of all of the different charging modes it employs.  The deciding factor for this particular model is that it has the constant voltage that you can use when you disconnect the battery to clean the terminals or change the battery.  More important to me than the radio presets are the engine control module settings.  It's nice not having to wait for the computer to relearn the particular variations of settings from the default ones.
79122,This is designed to work with the Valterra bayonet fitting on your Gray or Black water dump valve and it does just that...
79123,"This is a consortium of Latin and American actors trying to solve the impossible.  Add to this the complicated relationship between an Aspergers spectrum detective and her boss, subtitled Spanish, subtexts and subplots and the overall picture is both complicated and a good experience.  I believe this is a re-make of a series first shown in Denmark?  I will definitely search this out and watch it as well."
79124,"This is not my only capo, but it's my cheapest.  It works as well as other more expensive ones.  This one was a good deal through Amazon.com."
79125,My electric weed eater goes through way to much string. I am hoping this helps the situation. Tired of buying string
79126,This is amazing stuff.  This is great stuff.  Pull the filter out of my 2013 Jeep and within min it was clean.  Love it.
79127,"I began with Step 1 Polish, and Step 2 Micro-Polish and Glaze, and finished up with the Step 3 Wax, using the Mothers Powerball 4Paint.  The Powerball put the wax on smoothly and uniformly, and after doing Step 1 and Step 2, my hands welcomed the break using the Powerball.  The car looks a brilliant white now.  With all the work preparing the finish, I put 3 coats of wax on it.  The car is a full-size, and there is enough Step 1 and Step 2 to do at least another car, and despite the 3 coats of wax, there is still enough in the bottle for maybe another 2 or 3 wax jobs.  Very pleased with the 3 Step process, and the Powerball."
79128,"Based on Bill O'Reilly's bestselling book, KILLING KENNEDY offers a straightforward retelling of the events leading up to and immediately following the assassination.  Its primary interest lies in considering the impersonations: Rob Lowe makes a creditable JFK, whose commitment to good governance is matched only by his sexual appetite.  Ginnifer Goodwin plays Jackie Kennedy as a faithful wife consciously turning a blind eye to her husband's infidelities in the interests of the state.  She understands how important her task is to support her husband through difficult times.  Jack Noseworthy seems a little youthful for Bobby Kennedy, although he captures the sense of family loyalty that sustained both himself and JFK in their three years in power.  Will Rothhaar's Lee Harvey Oswald comes across as a deeply frustrated personality, yearning for a place in the limelight; the film suggests that his decision to kill JFK is motivated by his desire for fame, as well as political convictions.  Perhaps the film's moral schema is a little too simplistic (the Kennedys' life is portrayed in a roseate glow, through lighting and music, as compared with the squalor of the Oswalds' life), but it proves enthralling entertainment."
79129,"Almost like using a leather belt on your knife blades, very handy to have around"
79130,"I've been playing with this kit for a while and really like it. The battery pack is a powerful one and at 12000 mAh is one of the best I've used. I tried a quick test on my iPad and it powered up in record time. If it can rapidly juice up a power hog, undoubtedly it will work with all your small devices. There are adapters for almost any kind of device. It doesn't have the 30-pin iPad/-iPhone adapter because you don't need it. You simply take off the plug and hitch your USB cable into the side of this unit.One of the interesting things we accidentally discovered was a safety feature that would be perfect if you are on the road. You hold down the switch for three seconds to turn on the LED light, which is reasonably bright. If you lightly tap it again, you receive a strobe. Another light tap and you get the standard SOS signal. This was instantly recognized by another family member. If you never have to use this battery pack to jump start a car, it's worth carrying with you just in case of emergency. Everything comes in a nice faux leather case that closes with a dual nylon zipper system.WHAT'S INCLUDED:~ Battery pack, 12000 mAh~ Micro USB~ Mini USB~ Sony Ericsson K750~ USB cable~ Samsung D800 adapter~ PSP adapter~ CA-100 adapter~ Battery charger cables~ Laptop switch cable~ 8-piece laptop connector set~ Mobile phone switch cable~ 8-piece mobile phone connector set~ Car adaptor~ Home adapterInput: 100 - 240V AC 50/60HzOutput: 12V DC 1000mAIf you look at the interface you'll see from left to right a 19V 3.5 output port for a laptop, the battery indicator (five blue LED lights), a power switch, a 5V 2A output port for Smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, etc. a 12 V 5A output port for batteries, and a 12V 1A input port for self-charging. On the left-hand face there is the bright LED light/emergency signal and the port for the charging cables. The labeling has been silk-screened on and because it's silver, there isn't much contrast. I had to turn it back and forth to be able to read it, otherwise it blends in. My cables had a short in them so I was unable to try them with a car. This would be perfect to keep on hand for small engine batteries and general use. I really like this battery pack, especially because with all the added adapters, it's very useful even if you don't have to charge a car.Sample provided by the distributor."
79131,"That is some funny stuff right there. Beverly Hillbillies strike oil, but then stay on their own land and build a mansion. The only thing they are missing is Elly Mae. Maybe there is a cousin who they can introduce for that role later on in the series. Si is my favorite. He is the hillbilly version of Yogi Berra with his witism's and slightly twisted folksy sayings."
79132,It is almost too real.  Excellent acting.Have to pay close attention to understand.Can be overwhelming and complicated.Truth is hard.
79133,"I have been tempted to buy this pedal for a long time after looking at all the rave reviews.I already have an MXR line booster at the end of my pedal chain into my amp. This serves to give back the lost treble and shimmer after a long cable run. Replacing that with the EP booster did not have a significant impact on my tone. Yes it was a little colored, but not too different from the line booster.If at present you have no boost after your pedals and have a long cable run, yes definitely this pedal will make a world of difference by adding the top end back to the signal. I didn't find it magical though, because I've always had a boost at the end of chain and this was not much different.I am going to experiment with it in the effects loop to add a boost during solos."
79134,"For years I have struggled with floppy hoses that bend and expand which makes securing them difficult.  Once sewage loads them up they start flopping all over.  This is only a few dollars more, the connections are secure (I always double check any fitting) and the hose is far more sturdy. If you cheap out the consequences can be hideous."
79135,"Some chunks are huge and some are more reasonable sized with one-inch dimensions. I found that when using charcoal lighter fluid to start the chunks, the smaller ones started quickly while the larger ones started on only one or two sides and never did ignite on all sides. For that reason, the smoke from the chunks was significantly reduced.I will not buy Char-Broil apple wood chunks again and will use apple wood chips and charcoal instead."
79136,"Ive been using this now for about 4 months and its been working very well. My girlfriend & I have experienced some tire issues over several months, so its definitely been put to the test. Its compact size is extremely convenient, though the case it comes with is too tight for all its contents. It works very well on average size tires. I would NOT recommend this for use with large truck tires. As the instructions indicate, it should NOT be left on longer than 8 minutes. I did so once and the plug into the unit melted slightly. It was stuck for a while, but I separated it after a while and it continues to work just fine. The power cable material is too soft for something that produces so much heat. The main wire is 2-piece and the plug harnesses do not fit tightly. You can probably just squeeze it tighter, but I havent gotten to it just yet.Overall, its a very good portable compressor for the price for the occasional flat or low tire."
79137,"First off note that this will not fit the truck model equipped with the plastic oil pan, that has the large yellow quarter turn release oil drain plug.  This fits the trucks with the redesigned metal oil pan and removable bolt for draining the oil.When you remove the OEM oil pan bolt you will experience a rush of oil as 13 quarts of oil pours out.  With the Fumoto you have a more controllable flow as it is choked down into a smaller stream of oil.  It can also be flipped back to the closed position if you need to stop the flow of oil.  This model comes with a extended nipple, which allows for a hose to be attached for directing the flow of oil where you want it to go such as into an empty oil jug for the ease of recycling with no mess clean up."
79138,This is a really good series.  Can't wait for season 4.  Good plot twists and storyline. Maybe another alien race will join in for the fun.
79139,"Item arrived on time and as described, item is solid and well designed. does not need and installation and setup, this item can be adjusted to fit different sizes of guitars. I ll buy more for the other guitars at my house."
79140,"A fabulous show that was cancelled far too early. For those who haven't watched it, the show is a satirical situation comedy that focuses on a fictional multi-national corporation called 'Veridian Dynamics'. The main character, Ted, is the head of research and development and oversees a quirky team of scientists and product testers. I love the humor and the relationships between the characters. Portia de Rossi is perfectly cast as the emotionless member of management. The 'commercials' for Veridian Dynamics are hysterical. I highly recommend this show!"
79141,A new installment to a great show. Hasnt dipped in quality and laugh out loud humor since season 1 episode 1.
79142,"There's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't, it should).  This is a great all purpose dynamic mic, I use it for instruments, vocals, even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals, but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned, and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably, then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon, but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics, you can't go wrong here."
79143,"I bought this after mistakenly getting the same model in a size 8. This one actually fits, and works great one both my acoustic and electric."
79144,"Fits the car perfectly, and it's very good quality. I noticed a tick up in MPG, but that's probably more due to mine being so old."
79145,"I had busted one on my Lance trailer and wanted the exact screw hole configuration to avoid making anymore holes.  These match perfectly, although look whiter than the old ones, but that's to be expected. No seal is provided so I gave them a shot of chaulking."
79146,"This gadget has stereo in for your monitor mix & a passthrough for you mic so you can get the overall mix set then add in your mic to get the ""more me"" setting. It's simple & easy to use. Works great."
79147,"Perfect small side table to use for cups and other lightweight items. It is short and it isn't the most sturdy table, but for the price you can't beat it. It gets the job done."
79148,"I love Dr. Who, and the Christmas special is no exception.  My only complaint is that it would be nice to have the entire season, including the Christmas special, available as one TV Pass, instead of having to order the special separately."
79149,Really enjoyed this movie. It was engrossing. Richard Gere carries it though all the acting is good. Ending is very good.
79150,"We are in the country and with pasture walks/snow melts we have a lot of mud/water to clean off our very furry golden.  The reason we like these better than a towel is area of our hands.  It's just easier than a regular towel.  I keep one in our car, one on our porch and one stored.  It's large enough that even with a walk in the rain it can handle our 80-pound golden.  They wash well, though we do wash them on the gentle cycle and air dry."
79151,"I had landscaping fiber put down under my enormous two story hollies after a major trim job. First major rain and the fiber was coming up through the mulch. The landscaper said he would come back and use landscaping staples to hold it in place. Despite having worked at an upscale nursery for several years I did not know there was such a thing as landscaping staples. After giving up on the landscaper, I went on Amazon and searched for these and was happy to discover they were so cheap. I went out and fixed it all myself.I wish Amazon sold 5 star landscapers."
79152,"I like this spray detailer. It gives the car a very slick feel and seems to enhance the wax. Since these are all subjective observations, it's difficult to prove it is superior to other quick detailers, but for the prive and perceived performance, I am happy with this product. I use it on a Brilliant Black Audi with great results."
79153,"This season is more fun, and its great to see the families get together and accept each other.  Vanessa is a little hard to take (very, very selfish) but she is what she is, and she's right out there with it.  That's great."
79154,"I love, love, love Dr. Who.  I especially love Clara.  One of my favorite companions next to Rose and Donna."
79155,Have a couple guitars and a bass hooked in at the same time.  Attaches to my audio interface.  No cable switching.  Didn't need the sophistication of other mixers costing 5x as much.  Fast convenient way to switch guitars while recording.
79156,"My wife's 06 Kia Sportage has a very growly engine.  I never considered it that bad, but it bothered her.  I lined under the hood and some areas around the engine.  It quieted the bit of engine &#34;growl&#34; just enough that it no longer bothers her.Here is why I say another star would be possible for this product.  These cheap auto's have a lot of cheap plastics for wind control under the front bumper.  Ours had a lot of cracked pieces but no way to bond them back together.  This stuff is SO adhesive that I was able to get everything back together by lining the insides of all of these pieces and then mount back on the car.  I've never found a product that has more uses than noise control in my life.  If the adhesive holds up well to the elements, all the better.  Brilliant product for people who don't want to pay out the leg to a dealership, or wish to fix subtle sound issues on their own."
79157,The new doctor had a jarring effect on me. Very strong episodes- excellent storylines. But this doc is more emotionally charged. Fringed on soap opera. Love Billy Piper as Rose- she keep me involved & willing to continue the ride.
79158,I've wired and rewired countless guitars and have had a couple fail recently. Don't know if their QC has gone downhill or what. I didn't send them back because they're usually around $10 but it's disconcerting when a Fender product unexpectedly fails. It would have 5 stars but for the recent failures.
79159,"We entertain a lot outside during the summer months and there is nothing more irritating than to have yellow jackets and wasps swarming around you and your guests while eating.  They nest in rafters, under wooden benches and around our row boat. I do not have any negatives to share, but I would like to tell you what I like most:1-I love the trigger dispenser, rather than the traditional push button spray method.  It allows for  steady stream of treatment.2-It is guaranteed or your money back!3-The best part-- it sprays up to 29 feet away, vs. equivalent in Raid, which is only 22 feet.Overall, a good product that works well  with a price tag that  is lower than its competitor, Raid."
79160,Very funny! The new Dave Chapell Show! Real world comedy show that hits all the hot topics that others are afraid to address.
79161,"Assembly for this feeder is fairly easy and can be completed without a hassle, as all parts clearly correspond to the ones in the directions.  The grill-like piece fits over the bottom black one which holds the seeds.  The white plastic dome hovers above it and is meant to thwart squirrels from sampling the goods, too.  The metal rod can be adjusted for your preferred height before hanging up the feeder.I put this up in March, and the day after, there was snow, mixed precipitation and wind.  Whenever I looked out, it was bobbling around but stayed up fine, although some snow got into the metal grill or was absorbed through it when it began to warm up.  However, since it's almost spring, I doubt this will be a problem for the months to come.So far the squirrels have not discovered the feeder, or if they have, they haven't managed to stay on the platform long enough to spill the seed onto the ground, which is what they've done with previous feeders I've put up.  My yard has the usual birds that don't seem to migrate in winter around here: cardinals, robins, titmice and chickadees.  So far, they have had no problems visiting the feeder.  My fingers are crossed that the squirrels will be deterred at least for awhile, because the birds seem happy with their free snack, and my cats seem entertained watching them eat through the window."
79162,The ignition rotor is as advertised. It installed easily and does the job. I have no problem with recommending this product.
79163,"I'm not sure where to start.  This is big. Really big. Like a person or several kids could fit inside of it.  I like that aspect of it.  It arrived broken, and it really was not packaged well.  Most of the broken bits were corners and I thought it was mostly cosmetic and it was so huge that I didn't want to repackage it and send it back.  It will take at least 2 people to put this together.  When you start putting it together you are quickly met with frustration as the predrilled plastic parts don't match up and are really sort of ridiculous.  It took a lot of time and a lot of frustration and the bottom line is that it still didn't go together correctly.  I have boughth some liquid nails and and I am going to try and salvage it.  But I'm seriously not impressed for something that costs so much.  IF it went together nicely and IF it didn't break in shipping and IF it was everything it claimed to be, in my opinion it should cost about $100, certainly not 5 times that.  I was really disappointed."
79164,"Any actor who can raise the concerns of his audience for his character the way Mr. Taylor does gets my utmost rating.  The series also enjoys the benefit of excellent supporting characters, excellently portrayed by excellent actors and actresses. Anyone looking for an &#34;Old West&#34; flavor to their modern day crime dramas should really enjoy this series."
79165,"Once you have watched the first seasons, this second season is an instant must.  The relationships & dynamics continues along with the character's complicated relationships that is so fun to watch."
79166,"Sorry to see that this show had only one season.  I really enjoyed the &#34;his & hers side of the story&#34; format ... & how, after the verdict came down, the viewer was always let in on who actually committed the crime, irregardless of whether the jury got it right.  The only thing that was a bit irksome (as I did not find it plausible) was the sexual attraction of many of the male characters in the show to Kathryn Peale, who reminded me of an ex-nun, given her hair cut & dress.  I just didn't see it at all."
79167,"If you have ever tried to empty your black tank with a stock p00p tube then you will have an enormous amount of appreciation for the rhino hose kit. It is sturdy, it won't move on you once you pull the handle, and it has caps to seal in the freshness once you are done.The bad...like everyone else says, it will not fit in most standard p00p tube compartments. The bumper storage on my TT is 4.5&#34; and I would have to take the ends off to store it (easy enough....when it is clean). Fortunately, my TT has a small compartment with a door that is not big enough to store much else so I simply store this in a dedicated lock-tight container and put it in that compartment. Now there is room for my fishing poles in my bumper :-)If you can figure out how to store it properly, I think that this is the best one on the market right now."
79168,"This is the grill you will want to show off to your friend. It is so beautiful, it is not just a grill! You can understand as it was designed by an Apple guy. Sleek, smooth black steel, roll easily on 4 wheels and small foot print. You can probably recall that was what used to describe the Apple computer!The gas tank is hidden inside the stand. All operations are precise, everything fit together impressively well. It took a bit more than 5 minutes to get up to 450 deg F not like the description said, but it is no matter. I had to adjust the flame down because it got too hot. I can't believe I would say that about a gas grill. Its maximum temperatures' rival that of a charcoal grill. While I still keep my favorite charcoal Weber, I have been using this grill mostly since I got it. I need that hight temperature for steaks, and this grill delivered effortlessly.Cooking with this grill is a real joy. You will love it."
79169,"It's fun, the acting is soso, some of the story lines are soso, but again it's SoSo much fun, not sure I can recommend. But I like to watch and not soso sure I want anybody to know I'm watching."
79170,"yeah okay so maybe they will eventually tell us what happened out in the woods after the plane crash, but they are taking too long, and in the meantime, the stories are boring and non-existent.  I suppose it's to keep us watching, but it's disappointing.  How did they stay warm, given the fact that they used their last match?  and how did they get food?  What about the pilot- he couldn't have stayed strapped in his seat for a week!  and how did they keep Arizona's leg from bleeding out?  Cristina mentioned once that animals were coming for Lexie, but how did they keep the animals away from her?  I've loved this show from the beginning, but this season is one HUGE letdown so far.  At the very least, they should give us interesting story lines if nothing else.  I'm guessing it's going to end very badly, like too many good TV shows do.I can't stand how they just keep showing us tiny snippets of the crash without any explanations."
79171,"As an adult, I enjoyed this show (I've seen all 3 seasons).  However, I would strongly caution that it is NOT appropriate for teens, even though I know that is the target audience.  The show condones underage drinking, smoking pot and sex.  Use your discretion."
79172,"The girls watched this repeatedly and absolutely love this show. I have sat through some episodes and it is enjoyable, keep in mind this show is better suited for girls. It's set in Australia and plenty of beach and ocean scenes, if you have girls they will love this show as mine have."
79173,"i love this tuner so much! the only reason that i had to buy it a second time was because i lost my first one unfortunately at a music camp a few years back. it works so well though, and i knew i'd have to buy a second one since i'd never see the first one again."
79174,"Samantha (Najarra Townsend) part time lesbian and drug user gets slipped a roofie at a party and has unprotected car sex. The next few days, Sam gets progressively worse as she seems to have the worse STD on the planet. The story is about her getting sick and attempting to cope with life while trying to conceal an illness. I kept waiting for an alien to pop out of her and all I got were maggots.The disease was never explained. I thought Ms. Townsend did an excellent job and I would love to see her in something that has a plot worth watching. The plot ran around in circles and never went anywhere until the end when it got silly.Written, produced, and directed by Eric England.  Works as a rental. Don't expect horror. More of a drama/thriller.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. Brief male rear nudity."
79175,"At first I was disappointed that it wasn't Sherlock-y enough, but the characters developed nicely and the writing is quite good. The only drawback: Watson doesn't get story lines that aren't about reflecting the male lead. Let her exist in her own right, or let Sherlock's character reflect on her, as well. Doesn't get a feminist award, as it's still &#34;all about the guy.&#34;"
79176,Well written and acted.  Interesting how reality follows fiction at times.  Who writes the script for our Washington representatives?  Do they take their lines from this show?
79177,"I like the large capacity, and the hummers liked it right away. I guess I've gotten spoiled, but I miss a bee guard and ant moat. I made my own ant moat. A hanging wire would be nice. But I really appreciate the wide filler. Assembly was a little tough with my arthritic thumbs, but I got it done. The most important thing is that my tiny hummingbirds like it."
79178,It was fit tightly with my Honda Civic 2012. No any shaking found when the car running. I takes few days to get use to it. The whole rear view look much  wider but smaller and closer than the OEM one. Very good item with the price and Amazon delivered it fast as usual.
79179,This is not a bad snow pusher and ice scraper as far as they go.  My only real problem with it is the sheer bulk of the item which makes it a little inconvenient to just store in in the back seat of my smaller car.
79180,"This product still amazes me how it works, I found out about it on a chat forum and thought I'd give it a go.Small cal full of the solution in a bucket full of water, wipe on your car one section at a time, then dry it straight away and I swear to god it looks like you have waxed your car, my wife was amazed at how good it looked.  I don't know how it works but a few days after washing my vehicle it rained (like it always does) and the rain beaded on my hood and just ran off.  Excellent product."
79181,Creative and entertaining. Enjoy seeing what the contestants come up with. The judges are articulate and try to be constructive in their critiques.
79182,This show started strong and we enjoyed it for several years but not so much in the last two years. The last season was Ok but with the intersect getting into so many people it lost it's appeal. I was also disappointed with the ending.
79183,These work great. They really stabilized my 26' travel trailer. I use a small lock on them so no one takes them.Be sure to not over tighten these.
79184,The funnel is large enough to catch most splashes and has a grid to prevent the plug from going through.  Being able to close it up and take the oil directly to the recycler is very handy but I wish that I had purchased the larger version so that I could change the oil in both cars without having to dump in between.  Construction seems solid.
79185,I loved all 3 seasons of Lie to Me! I have to say the main character got a little goofier in the 3rd season but still a great show! I felt left down that it ended without real closure. I wanted more!I may be imagining it but I notice I watch peoples facial expressions a little closer since viewing Lie to Me. Maybe there really is something to reading lies!
79186,I enjoyed watching the first season of Bitten and was disappointed that it might not be a second season. I really liked the story line. And every time an episode ended I couldn't waite for the next one
79187,"Season 2 is a continuation of season 1 and has a good finale (no spoilers). It did seem to take a long time to get there and there are a lot of layers to this story, but all in all it was good. I like how you think you know who did it, but then maybe not. It really keeps you guessing."
79188,Used on neglected wheels and made a real difference but not magical as some say. Saved me some rubbing and would recommend to others.
79189,"Entertaining fantasy.  I grew up in a German American town and enjoy comparing some of the characters to some memories of my childhood.  Of course things were not nearly as exciting back then as the adventures in the story!  To some extent, to appreciate such fantasy one must be willing to engage a willing suspension of disbelief.  Being able to follow the story lines in sequence, without interruption, the way Prime streaming allows is wonderful."
79190,"Written in the blush of new ownership:  Let's be clear, this is not a go into the forest and cut wood for the winter chainsaw.  I bought this saw to use as a shop tool for preparation of blanks for woodturning.  Having said that, it cuts very well, has sufficient power for the purpose, is not too loud and is well balanced.  It is well made for the duty for which it is designed.  Several have reported that the sprocket gear was plastic.  Mine is metal.  It looks like it might be pretty light, but it is metal.I expect it to hold up well under the use that I intend for it.  I would expect it to hold up for normal home tree maintenance use.  I would not expect it to hold up to days of bucking logs.Cold experience:  Over the past 10 months or so, I have cut about 10 short log sections into chunks and cut some vertically for bowl blanks.  I don't think this constitutes a lot of use.  The painted name on the bar is barely marred.  The chain is still quite sharp.  Today I was cutting a log vertically which is the easiest cut for a saw as you are cutting with the grain.  Chain is nice and sharp, everything is great, except suddenly the motor is running and the chain is still.  Fast forward through a lot of diagnostic stuff to learn that the sprocket in the inside of the saw is in fact plastic and has in fact melted.  I was looking at the outside sprocket when I said it was metal.My money was completely wasted.  This saw is junk as a number of other reviewers stated.  The best part of the whole thing was when I called Poulan customer service at 3:55 PM Central time and was told that the ""general questions"" section was closed, their hours being from 8:00 to 4:30 Central time.  I can't speak for customer service but their engineering department is clearly closed.Avoid this purchase."
79191,"What is it? : Simply put it is a peripheral for your car that reads data that your car is already capturing.  The read data is then sent to your smart phone and helps you become a more efficient driver.  Simultaneously it helps you analyze issues with your car and correct them as necessary.How does it work?:  You take the device and plug it into your cars OBD II port.  OBD stands for on board diagnostics.  The port is usually found under the dash on the drivers side (depending on vehicle).  You also need the FREE application from Automatic for your smartphone.  We used an iPhone 5 in our testing.  The device connects to your car and then your smartphone using Bluetooth after which the application takes over and monitors your car and your driving habits.  ** You can move the device between different cars and have the application remember your vehicles.What does it do, exactly? :  The Automatic will monitor your driving habits such as speed, quick acceleration, hard braking, etc...  It will also monitor codes from your car for problems...and simultaneously tell you what the codes mean and what you need repaired (ie. pesky check engine lights, etc).  The device also has audible alerts for when you drive at 70mph, brake hard, and or accelerate too quickly.  The audible alerts are small beep patterns that are emitted from the device and just quick warnings...nothing too loud or obtrusive.  It just helps you to understand your driving habits and maybe adjust them for more fuel economy.  While all of this is happening, the application on your smartphone is collecting this data via bluetooth so it can give you a report on your driving.  The application and the device are supposed to track when you fill up at the gas station (supported on some cars as per their site).....; we have not tested this as of yet.How did you test it and what cars did you try?:  I have only had it for 2 days now and we tested in the following vehicles: 2006 Acura MDX, and a 2009 Altima Hybrid.  We plugged it in, paired it to the phone, and setup our vehicle (takes 1-2 minutes).  We then naturally went on some drives and fortunately enough they involved some highway driving (speed limit 65mph).  I am also fortunate in that I have a 16.5yr old son who is learning to drive and a bit over confident in his skills.  We went out on our first journey and once on the highway, my son hit 70....the Automatic let our an audible beep that alerted the kid that he was at 70mph....he slowed down.  The car we used for our first set of testing was our Acura MDX with about 6 passengers...so it was a bit heavy.  When we got off of the highway at what was a short exit ramp, he ended up having to brake a bit hard...the Automatic alerted him to that.  (PS...the app does tell you what alerts mean what...with sample sounds). That was day one...the app for some reason did not keep a record of that drive and that does concern me somewhat; I feel that it is an error on my part and not the device.I personally think this is a great way to learn how to drive efficiently and to get information from your car that already exists  (yes, our cars have black boxes;;lol).  Also, since we have a youngster that is beginning to drive, this device makes it easy for him to know when he is wrong and when he is driving correctly.  While it will not fix habits for established drivers, it will alert you to things you can change.I feel this is an excellent product and has a huge potential going forward.  So far I love it and I have no hesitation in recommending it.  I do recommend that you check if it is compatible with your vehicles before you buy.5/5 stars for us.UPDATE 10/30/13:  I have been using this device for a few days now and am even more impressed with it then I was before.  Here is what I learned:1. You must have your smartphone in the car with the application running in the background for the smart processing to provide you information about your driving.  It actually calculates your $$$ spent on gas and notifies you of how many hard accelerations, braking's, etc.2. Today it came up and prompted me to add 3 contacts that it could notify in case of a severe crash.  I did...it accessed the contacts on my iPhone.  One piece of advice..make sure those people are aware you are going to add them; they will get a text message (my wife got a text and panicked, until I explained the situation).  This will actually send messages to 3 of those people if you, god forbid, are in a severe crash.  Naturally you must have cell coverage when that happens and an undamaged phone.3.  The device will run and operate without the smartphone application and continue to provide the driver audible alerts for speeds at 70mph, hard braking, and hard acceleration.  It just cannot track your driving on the application...this is a PLUS point as anyone can use the car and feel a bit smarter about driving habits.So far so good....more to come in the days ahead, I am sure.  IMPRESSED!"
79192,The socket works great with a cordless drill for lowering and lifting the scissor jack on our RV unit.  Good product arrived as scheduled.
79193,"I always liked Jen and Bill. She's so upbeat and he's so funny. And they seem like a rock-solid couple who don't take the good things they've earned in life lightly. It was fun watching them become a couple, marry, and build their dream home. Unfortunately, we've also seen them struggle with infertility, but now they have welcomed a son--and soon a daughter--into the family. Watching the couple interact with their adorable child, Will, adopted from China, is heartwarming. They've jumped straight into the terrible twos, which is not an easy age even for parents who've known their babies since birth, but Bill and Jen are dealing with their little one the way they deal with most challenges: with a positive attitude and a great sense of humor. This couple wanted to be parents so badly and they are really appreciating the beautiful child they now have.I can't say enough good stuff about Bill and Jen. They've remained in their jobs and don't seem to have let notoriety go to their heads, unlike plenty of other reality TV families.It's a terrific show and I can't wait to meet the soon-to-be fourth member, daughter Zoe."
79194,"Love this show and all other Anthony Bourdain Shows as well. Shame on Amazon with me being a paid Prime customer to be notified of the price increase and go and turn on my prime watchlist to find that none of my shows are Prime eligible anymore!!! Just a little over a week later! Now...why am I going to pay more to pay again? NOT GOOD AMAZON! NOT GOOD AT ALL OF YOUso if you are willing to pay twice, this show is definitely well worth it"
79195,"They are wealthy fakes pretending to be good old boys.  Cops was an excellent reality show because it was not fake!  Now they make fake junk like this and call it reality, but this has nothing to do with reality.  It's amazing how the sheep suck up this BS.  Also, the claim about them being religious is perverted version of religion.  The story goes that God created man in his own image.  Not in any bible does it say &#34;white&#34; men only, so how can racist bigots like these guys be considered religious?  It's completely FAKE garbage!"
79196,"I've been a musician for over 40 years.  I've seen an awful lot of products come and go.  I don't get excited about the latest-and-greatest very easily... but having said that, this is the best idea in headstock tuners I have encountered. I bought one, and found it so useful, I ordered two more!  Planet Waves makes good quality stuff, and they make some 'faddish' stuff.  This item is definitely in the good quality family.  It's easy to read outdoors in the daylight, yet not so bright as to distract in low stage light.  Great design, Planet Waves!  Excellent price, GO-DPS!"
79197,It is easy to installed. It makes my car look really nice and fun. I love it and recommend it
79198,"Behringer has done it again. The PP400 Ultra-Compact Phono Preamp is exactly what it looks like:It's ultra-compact. It takes up a very negligible amount of space. It will sit comfortably between a turntable and another component.In its compactness, though, it does NOT sacrifice usability. It has no trouble amplifying a turntable's signal to line level. Before buying a preamp, amp could only boost my turntable to a 'easy listening' level. The noise was evident in the signal due to far too much amplification being necessary. With the help of this preamp, my amp no longer acts as a crutch and I can comfortably listen to music without my amp's 'I'm turned up to 11 and struggling' noise.The build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point. It's not cheap plastic like many companies would try to sell, the entire enclosure is fairly thick metal. This makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look. It also features a ground terminal which will hook up to many turntables and amps to further reduce interference.Unfortunately, there is no option to buy it in black. Judging from the accessible screws on the side, though, it would be a small task to take apart the enclosure and paint it myself if I wanted.This preamp also does not have a power switch, but this is not much of an issue. It's one small complaint on an otherwise amazing product.Summary:If you need a preamp, buy this one. It has the same build quality and performance as much more expensive preamps."
79199,The ARB tree strap fills a void in the 10' length. I carrier a 4' tree strap along with this strap which feels a void for bigger trees. Plus this strap will also double as a tow strap when pulling other vehicles off the trail. The Capacity is plenty enough on this strap as well. One of the better tree straps I have used. The bright neon color sticks out as well which makes it that much easier to keep up with on the trails.
79200,"Guitar picks. What can I say? I bought these along with my first guitar, so its not like I have a preference. But they come in a pack of 10 so there are plenty of spares when you lose them, and you will. Definitely good enough to start with until you gain enough experience to know the difference between all the many kinds of picks."
79201,"These shocks fit perfectly, and provided enough power to lift the hood without effort.  I would highly recommend them if they make a model for your vehicle."
79202,"Many years ago I had a Fender Stratocaster and I had to get rid of it, so now I have the closest that I will ever get to that guitar again. This one sounds great and looks good, and the price is great as well."
79203,Purchased this to replace missing cap on RV.  Works as expectedbut would like to see bigger nubs or perhaps 2 wings to makethis a little easier to put on and remove.
79204,"I always thought that ""Psycho"" was overrated.  Sure, it was a very good horror movie, particularly for its time.  But there have been far better horror movies throughout cinematic history:  ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Omen,"" etc. etc.  But for me, it wasn't the direction of ""Psycho"" that went south; I thought that it was Anthony Perkins.  In reality, he wasn't a very good actor, and I believe that Alfred Hitchcock's biggest weakness was:  he tended to hire actors that he thought that he could mold with his own fingers, instead of hiring actors that were already good.  Sometimes it worked, but often times it failed.But Mr. Hitchcock is no longer around, and Vera Farmiga was cast as the mother character in ""Bates Motel.""  Now that would be a serious score, as I kind of figured that she'd never do TV.  She has some really nice acting chops -- as well as some eyes that seem to look into the future -- and she gets to show those chops off in the pilot, which I thought was pretty interesting.  The jury's still out on Freddie Highmore, but I actually liked him here better than Mr. Perkins, where Mr. Highmore plays a younger version of the momma's-boy-goes-bad character.While watching, I thought that this new series is filmed in Oregon, but peeking around the web, I believe that it may be filmed in British Columbia, Canada.  If so, from what I understand, the Canadians are much smarter than Americans when it comes to influencing series to film there, due to financial considerations.  As an example, one of the best series in history -- ""The X Files"" -- was mostly filmed in Vancouver until the end, at least until David Ducovny got married, I believe.  At any rate, I liked the scenery and the rain adds to the suspense, wherever it's filmed.It appears that this is kind of a prequel thing, where we're going to learn why Norman Bates became psycho in the first place.  The pilot gives some hint of how his overbearing, and very passive-aggressive mother, starts to form his psyche, and I found it interesting.  The one thing that I thought about while watching:  ""Hey, this is a pretty good idea.  Why hasn't anyone thought of doing this until now?""Well, we don't have to wait anymore for an explanation for why Norman Bates went all Ozzy Ozbourne and boarded the Crazy Train.  And I hope that the rest of the series is as good as the pilot."
79205,"Vikings is one of my favorite shows on television! This show is so well done and the twists and turns in the plot are always just awesome! There have been more times durring this show that i have litterally stood up and cheered ur jumped in excitement for an awesome sequence or twist than any other show ive watched! Ragnar is the man, and the charicters are all so well developed! I hope for many many more seasons. If you havent watched any Vikings yet you need to sit down and have a &#34;prime&#34; marathon starting with season one!"
79206,Did not like this episode at first because it seemed all to predictable but it sure ended with a bang. :D Looking forward to seeing more like it.
79207,"I have purchased other tire gauges from Accutire and have found them to be sturdy, long lasting and accurate. I purchased this gauge for use on my Honda Goldwing motorcycle. I needed a right angle low clearance gauge to clear the brake disks and check my suspension pressure. I also have found the gauge convenient for my wife's Honda 50, 2013 Honda CRV w/TPM valves and my ATV's. With this gauge I don't have to bend or place angle pressure on the sides of the tire valve stems."
79208,I reviewed Season 1 -- and the good keeps going with Season 2 !
79209,"I just put on the wipers, and after two weeks (and two rains) notice that they do wipe as effectively as my Rain-X.  Fit was good, easy installation, appears to be well made.Pros:-Sturdy-Little to no streakingCons:-None yet (two weeks of usage)"
79210,"Good when on your motorcycle. A little tight fitting over the head to cover your neck, but it will keep the cold wind off of you."
79211,"I check the ATF fluid on my newly acquired Acura.  The color of the fluid was not too dark, but the level was low.  The shifting of gears were not too bad, but I do hear a drone/hum.  There is a slight vibration when I put load on the tranny which makes me uneasy.  Record shows the ATF was serviced about 10K miles ago.  The car is normally driven by my wife, and this past weekend, when I drove it, I could really tell the vibration was getting more severe.  I did not want to take any chances, so I had the car parked until the transmission fluid was done.  I order the Red LIne D4 from Amazon with next day delivery.I drained the old ATF and refilled with Red Line. The difference is night and day.  Shifting is so much smoother and the vibration is gone.  I am going to do the 3X3 flush, but I am going to take my time.  I'll do the next flush in a month or two...I highly recommend this product!"
79212,"I Wait all week for the show! It has just enough drama and action to make it perfect.....for years now the walking dead was my number ONE show, but sadly, it took just a few episodes of the Vikings to totally steal that spot.'....the show is amazing"
79213,"The most amazing features of this ""Sweeper"" are the weight and balance. The battery weight is seemingly negated by the overall design that puts the hand position between it and the motor. This makes this yard tool very easy to use.Having six power settings lets me sweep everything into one area quickly on higher settings and then use  lower settings to get things into a smaller area to be picked up.The battery charges quickly and lasts long enough to do the driveway, sidewalk, curb, and patio with no noticeable lessening of power.This is another in the Black & Decker line of lawn tools that work as well as they are advertised to."
79214,"I enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 so much that I purchased season 3.  Wish they made more smart series like this one.  The show is elegant, with good looking actors and intelligent scripts. On season 3 the conflict is not just with clients but among the main characters, mergers and loyalty is tested. The hooks from one episode to the next are very well set, making you want to watch them all."
79215,"This was a great episode, but I may be biased because I think all of their episodes are great. And as a collector myself I always learn something new from these guys."
79216,"Matte black finish-Did not have the 4 backing pads only came with 2. Bought rubber gasket material and made a real non metal to metal mounting application.Please note these Do Fit a 2014 Jeep Sahara Unlimited. So I suspect it fits all JKU's even though the fitment guide say it does not fit the 2014 JK Jeep.The stainless hardware is great. But you do have to Hack-Saw the carriage bolt down to about 5/8"" in total length. I also cut out a rubber square to place between light bracket & light mount.Kit should come with a Ny-Lok stainless nut to deter thieves from using a 1/2"" end wrench & spinning it off & taking your $325.00 pair of 40w Spot LED Lamps!Overall this is a better product than the rest because your lights are not mounted as to hinder your view thru the W/S."
79217,"I picked one of these up and I'm happy with it. The bristles aren't as sturdy as other brushes, but the fact that it gets between so many grates at once is awesome, and worth a few extra passes. Plus, being Weber, I didn't have to worry about it messing up the ""porcelain enamel"" grates.Update: After many months of use I find it doesn't do the job as well as when it was new. Maybe to be expected but for the price I wanted a longer life."
79218,One of the very best shows on TV.  It is just amazing the footage of the wrecks. I can not wait until the next series.
79219,Great all around product with strong uv protection especially important here in Florida. Used another product that really screwed up my dash  board. This fixed it right up and does not leave a shinny surface that is going to reflect in your windshield. I would describe the finish it leaves as satin. I would suggest spraying it on a cloth when doing your dash board so as not to get it on the inside of the windshield. If you just want to use one product for all your rubber and vinyl this is it.
79220,Didn't ever get past the second episode. Seemed a lot of it centered around sex scenes and talk.Don't recommend it.
79221,"Well made tube with good amount of gain and highs. Excellent for cleans and crunch due to increased clarity. For high gain metal, however, I found that it's a bit too hairy. For instance, as V1 position in my preamp, it had a little too much trebly sizzle versus other tubes. For comparison, a Sovtek has less of this ""hair"" and is tighter sounding but also has more of an upper mid-range fizz which can get annoying. In the end, I switched the Tung Sol with a Ruby AC7 which was formerly in the V2 (overdrive) position, and that got me better articulation with less fizz. So Ruby AC7 in V1, Tung Sol in V2 - that's been my best combo so far."
79222,If you like HOMELAND you will enjoy this Cold War period piece.  The characters are exciting and each episode builds on the other.  I would recommend it highly for those who like watching &#34;cat and mouse&#34; spy thrillers.  I look forward to season 2.
79223,"Living in the Midwest, there hasn't been much opportunity to wash my GMC Savana conversion van.  The weather has been lousy and way to cold and/or rainy to even think about cleaning the van inside or outside.  I have been using Shamwows to dry the van in past years and they truly worked well.  However, they require more wringing out than does this microfiber towel as it seems to absorb, absorb, absorb.  It is a valuable tool for car washing and drying, and probably for other uses as well.Highly  recommended."
79224,"I've had this water cooler hanging in my back yard for over a month and I've never seen a bird on it once. I clean it, fill it, I've moved it to see if another spot is more appealing. There are a ton of birds in my yard, but they want nothing to do with this water cooler."
79225,"I'll begin by saying I'm a pretty ardent Dr. Who fan since way back when (my Doctor being Tom Baker.) Accordingly, I expected more from this long-awaited and heavily promoted Part 2. It's not that it's bad; it's just not that good. Are we a little worn out with Matt Smith? I think we may be. Far be it from me - an actor - to shove someone out of a remunerative role, but Smith reached the end point of his persona, I think, in Part 1 of this Season. We've seen all his mannerisms and responses to the point where we, the audience, could probably finish writing each episode's script after the first three minutes.As to the new Companion...hmmmmn. I'm not liking her. She lacks the off-center, working class cheek of Donna Noble, the vulnerable all-new-to-me aura of Rose, the wounded, loyal ferocity of The Girl Who Was Left Behind. Clara's story got off to a good start, with a Who is she, really? premise - and then disappeared into a confusing set of mixed signals. Clara's gee whiz-this is so-fabulous stare is not convincing, since a canny competence underlies it; she masters adventure and danger all too easily. And - call me cynical - but might there be an off-screen romance between her and Matt Smith? Those entre nous glances are all too frequent. Whether the actors are sharing a joke at the audience's expense or are simply sharing each other, something - something un-actor-ly - is bleeding onto the set.Sometimes the Who seasons get off to rocky starts and take a while to sort themselves out, so I'll keep watching. (Well, I bought the season, anyway.) But this is only a Part 2 half-season; so the sorting out better be fast and strong, or this may be the season I turn into an ex-Whovian."
79226,"My 21/2 year old grand daughter is always asking to watch this show. I created her own page on the laptop, with Amazon Prime Video as her home page. So now when she has TV time she can choose the show she wants, 'Little Bear' is one of her favorites.  Each episode is a learning experience."
79227,WOW! This basting mop is amazing. Talk about great coverage for ANY type of marinade. And the clean up is amazing. I rinsed mine out. Put them in my dishwasher and they came out like they were brand new.
79228,"First use, set the pressure to 37 psi & started inflating the tire. After 5 minutes, I unplugged it & found the tire pressure to be 53 psi. Not sure if it's me or the unit. At least it works."
79229,These installed very easily and they look great if your looking for a quick way to add something to your jeep these are great.
79230,"I enjoyed the acting - especially Ciaran Hinds.  The plots have fun twists, the to and fro between the actors is good to watch"
79231,"I am a fan of the Michael Connelly series about detective Bosch and I would watch this series.  For me after years of books, Titus Welliver wasn't Bosch and I missed some other charaters from the book.  I know, I know, it was just the pilot but hey, I can hope.  All that negative aside, I liked the show, the action, I liked Welliver's acting.  I hope the show succeedss.  I will watch."
79232,"Was my first time cleaning an MAF sensor on a car. I used this product on two vehicles. Works great and evaporates very quickly so as not to leave residue. If you've never done this before, just note you have to wait a little to let the thing dry before trying to start your car once it's back in."
79233,"The two end trap doesn't work on smarter pests, like the average Raccoon. I concocted a workaround, using a paperclip I hang the bait over the trip plate and get the little rodents about a third of the time. Just putting bait behind the plate, they will just come in the other door. I also wish the sensitivity was adjustable, because something is delicately stealing the bait much of the time (Possum?). Any way, its a descent trap just needs a little added engineering......"
79234,Fun to watch.  As a fan of Angelina Jolie it was nice to hear cast and crew praise her for her professionalism.
79235,"We enjoyed this series due to it's interesting plot, the quality of the scripts, the acting, and the photography. Other than that, to avoid introducing a spoiler, we leave it up to the viewer to check the synopsis which comes with each episode and then watch that episode. We don't think that you'll be disappointed."
79236,"Several reviewers have commented on the basic themes of Rithy Panh's documentary; what is perhaps more interesting is the way in which the title operates on two levels.  First, Panh's film aims to fill in &#34;the missing picture&#34; of life in Cambodia under the Pol Pot regime.  For most of the time, the only visual material available on this regime was propaganda films depicting an idealized world of workers happily contributing to the new country Kampuchea's collective sense of well-being.  Through a mixture of clay figures and archive footage, Panh proves the opposite; most citizens had to get used to a combination of perpetual hunger and enforced labor.  The clay figures are an important element of this film, suggesting that human beings can be rendered malleable in any way their makers/ captors choose.  At another level, the film tries to recreate the &#34;missing picture&#34; of Panh's past; at the age of fifty, he looks back at his childhood in the pre-Pol Pot era, a world of color and variety that was ruthlessly swept away, as the people were forced to wear black and work inhumanly long hours in the rice-fields.  The experience left an indelible mark on Panh's character, as he lost most of his family due to starvation, without being able to do a thing about it.  Even now he feels guilty for his inaction.  Living under a tyrannous regime was bad enough, but what was much worse for Panh was the way in which that regime rendered him powerless, as well as depriving his life of the possibilities - both personal as well as professional - that could have been available in the pre-Pol Pot era.  The &#34;missing picture&#34; cannot be recreated, however hard he tries.  The film ends on a somber note, as Panh reminds us how much the souls of the millions who died during the Pol Pot regime still haunt those who survived.  While efforts have been made to erase the past (a lake has been built over one of the mass graves), he still feels somehow united with the dead rather than the living - an indication, perhaps, of the emotional and physical consequences of tyranny.  While THE MISSING PICTURE offers a country-specific interpretation of the past, its message should be heeded by everyone about the consequences of living under an absolutist government."
79237,"The CobraCo metal frame flower box fairly sturdy & is made to hold a standard size plastic container (not included).It is adjustable & expandable within limits. Make sure your vertical rails are far enough apart to fit the back (stability bar) portion of the box frame (mine are not), otherwise you will have to make modifications or return the flower box.Had the flower box fit my railing, it would have added a nice touch to my front deck. It seems to be sturdy enough to hold a plastic container, potting soil & plants.  Just measure before ordering & there should be no surprise."
79238,This is my favorite series but I think it is still one or two episodes to go.  The actor that plays Oliver Queen is very good.  I did not read the comic but I saw the green arrow or emeral arrow on Smallville.  I hope this series get a great review.
79239,A little humor with a good mystery. The characters are interesting and so far it has not become a total soap opera.
79240,I found this to be a very intense mini-series where everybody must have an ID card to exist.  I was looking forward to the next segment each time and was disappointed that it ended.
79241,"Season 5 was SO good.  What a shame, SG-1 was ten seasons, I wish Atlantis could have had a few more.  What a great show.  The visual effects were getting better and better with lots of action, story line and plot twists.  Where are these Stargate Atlantis movies they talked about making?"
79242,I like the other M brand better than Mothers. You have to switch rags constantly with this stuff. Not bad though.
79243,Wow! Having discovered this series by accident through Prime membership one evening on my Kindle Fire I started watching episode 1. After that I was hooked. KGB! FBI! Plots and counter plots! 80's sunglasses! Disguises! Well deserved distrust on both sides! How will it end? Watch it!
79244,"We live in a nearly 100-year-old farmhouse so getting mice in the house is just part of the deal. I have used glue traps and snap traps and others with good success - we even had a cat that was very good at catching mice.However, since getting these traps we have not gotten any mice with them -- but neither have the cats. I guess it just not the right season for the mice to be trying to raid our house.If you do not want to use snap traps or glue traps this might appeal to you - the important thing is to use a little bit of peanut butter."
79245,"The description doesn't do this rib rack justice.  This thing is pretty big and will hold a LOT of chicken.  You will certainly not complain about running out of room!  Even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood, there's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8.  Washing it may be a problem.  Just wash it immediately after using it."
79246,One of my favorite television series.  Just can't get enough of Hart of Dixie. I really enjoy watching the series over and over.
79247,"Remember when you were a kid, and something came on the tube that looked an awful lot like it was going to feature women behind bars?  It looked like it was going to be filled with every sequence of catfight after catfight, ladies going at it (for their dear lives!)?  They&#8217;d be scratching, pulling hair, kicking, punching away at one another inside of ninety minutes, and you knew &#8211; without a doubt &#8211; that only the strong would survive?  Remember how &#8211; when the trailer ended &#8211; mom and dad made you turn the channel or (worse!) simply turn the TV off because they didn&#8217;t want you watching that &#8220;garbage&#8221;?  Oh, come on, you pleaded with them, just let me watch the first fight, and then you&#8217;ll turn it off, but they still refused, telling you that there were much better things you could do with your time under their roof, in that city, on this Earth?RAZE is the film you want to watch to make up for missing the other.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the box art: &#8220;After she is drugged and abducted, Jamie awakens to find herself in a concrete bunker where she meets fellow abductee Sabrina.  Before long the two women discover that they are in a modern-day coliseum, where they and 48 other women have been selected to fight to the death in order to save both themselves and their loved ones.  Co-starring genre favorites Doug Jones and Sherilyn Fenn, director Josh C. Waller&#8217;s RAZE is a no-holds-barred assault on the senses featuring some of the most brutal combat action ever put on film.  In this contest, may the best woman win.&#8221;Confession time: I&#8217;d seen a preview for RAZE either late last year or earlier this year.  I honestly don&#8217;t remember which.  Meh, the time isn&#8217;t important.  Anyway, I&#8217;d long ago tired out on the whole idea of taking previews seriously.  I&#8217;d been burned by so many great theatrical trailers down through the years, that &#8211; probably ten years back &#8211; I said &#8220;no more,&#8221; and I stopped getting excited about the promised features.  After all, they never live up to the hype.This trailer was a bit different.  It struck a chord.  It rang a bell.  It promised Zoe Bell in a leading role, and, for those of you who wouldn&#8217;t know her face, you&#8217;ve probably seen her work.  She&#8217;s a wonderfully talented stunt woman from New Zealand.  During XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS?  When Xena was doing something particular bad-ass?  That wasn&#8217;t really Lucy Lawless you watched.  Odds are, it was Zoe Bell.  If you don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s the cat&#8217;s meow like I do, then I encourage you to check out her &#8216;stunts&#8217; profile on IMDB.com.  Bell&#8217;s the real deal &#8211; the kind of girl every fanboy wants to take home to meet mom &#8216;cause he knows she might not be good enough for him but she&#8217;ll definitely go down fighting for him.So I saw that trailer, and &#8211; with guarded optimism &#8211; I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get your hopes up.  Don&#8217;t overthink it.  Don&#8217;t hold your breath.&#8221;  Like I told you, I&#8217;d learned my lesson.  I&#8217;d been let down before.  I didn&#8217;t want to be let down again.  Somewhere in the back of my mind, I heard a little bird whisper, &#8220;Zoe won&#8217;t disappoint you.  You&#8217;ll see.&#8221;Well, I just watched RAZE &#8230; and it&#8217;s perfect.In fact, I&#8217;m so smitten with it I hope there&#8217;s a sequel.  And another.  And another.  I hope every film in the history of films yet to be written can take a lesson from its benign simplicity: when it comes to action, don&#8217;t spare the girl.  Why?  Well, here&#8217;s a few good reasons.  Sarah Connor.  Ripley.  Nikita.  Michonne.  Eva Green as Artemisia in 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE.  Angelina Jolie in SALT.  Uma Thurman in KILL BILL.  Milla Jovovich in any of the RESIDENT EVIL picks.  And Michelle Yeoh in just about anything she&#8217;s done.The more of them, the happier we fanboys are.Plus, it&#8217;ll only get Zoe Bell more work.RAZE (2013) is produced by Cinipix, Cosmic Toast Studios, and Quincy Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group under the IFC Midnight label.  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly made flick, ponying up some deliciously delirious sights and sounds to anyone who&#8217;s willing to sit for it.  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then &#8211; like with the film &#8211; you&#8217;re in for the time of your life: there&#8217;s a commentary, cast and crew interviews, deleted scenes, extended fight sequences, a gag reel, multiple theatrical trailers, and no doubt a kitchen sink somewhere I missed: a sprawling assortment, which shows that everyone involved knew that fans would most definitely want to know more!  Bravo!HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  I&#8217;m not a fool.  I know that RAZE is not the kind of film that&#8217;ll please everyone.  Nor will my ringing endorsement please others.  However, as a lifelong fan of action films and as a budding aficionado of flicks dabbling in exploitation, I must unabashedly admit to loving every minute of it from start-to-finish.  It&#8217;s a no holds barred bloody knuckle brawl that should be celebrated by those who&#8217;ll love it most, which means telling most high-brow critics to go stuff themselves because they couldn&#8217;t possibly understand why it&#8217;s just so darn good.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me a DVD copy of RAZE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape or form influenced my opinion of it."
79248,I  like these chairs a lot.  I got them because they will be perfect for my unheated summer porch. Since it is the middle of winter I have been using them in my house as extra chairs at my dining room table. They look and feel great.While I am not much into interior decorating I am amazed that wicker chairs would actually look good inside my house.  The dark brown color come close to matching the color of my dining room table. The simple look of a wicker chair with a cushion works well.The chairs feel strong. I have had 250 pound friends sitting in the chairs and the chairs held steady.  When I sit in them I don't notice any difference from regular chairs and these are stronger than the old dining room table chairs that I am currently using.When I lean back the wicker gives a little so I my back feels comfortable rather than feeling like I am leaning back on a hard surface like you would get from a wood chair.  The wicker should work well in the heat because air can circulate better through woven wicker than cloth or wood.The seat cushions are comfortable.  I feel like I am sitting on a soft surface rather than a hard chair.The chairs are relatively light and easy to move.The bottom of the chairs seem to be made of a wood like material. It will not damage my wood floors at all.Since I am in New Jersey I have not used these chairs outside so I can't comment on how easy it is to clean them. I plan to use them in an enclosed screened in unheated porch which can get over 100 degrees in the summer. I also plan to use them when I have parties in my back yard. I will have more of a chance to test how they hold up to changes in temperature and the dirt than can accumulate from summer parties when that happens.I really like these chairs.
79249,I have these on my 2008 Toyota Matrix. After 2 years they are still working good and do not need replaced yet. For the money they are great. Was easy to install and seem like will last at least another year before needing replaced. When is time I will replace with the same thing!
79250,"I admit it -- the show can me a little &#34;young,&#34; and a couple of the characters are a little melodramatic.  But...it's a really entertaining show.  Basically -- when there's a show that has kids with powers, I'm in."
79251,"I resisted the series and am glad I changed my mind. The last season delivers the same amazing and finely honed character development, plot development, dialogue and acting since the Sopranos which is the gold standard. Bravo writers and actors."
79252,"I had a small divit-like chip in my windshield. I didn't think it warranted the hassle of getting it repaired professionally, so I decided to try this. It really didn't do anything, but it did make the chip flush with the windshield. I'm sure it is now less likely that it will crack, but it is still just as visible if not more. My only guess is that I could have cleaned out the chip a little better, but it seemed I got all of the crushed glass out."
79253,Nice heavy receiver block. This works great with tow straps when I have to pull friends out of the ditch after a good snow.
79254,"Vivid colours, a nice glimpse at the early sixties, cigarettes and alcohol at the office.  This season, while staying with the same spirit as the previous two, has a better plot in terms of the business of advertizing, but disappoints a little in relationship content.  In particular, Christina Hendricks does not appear enough and a previous subplot involving the fantasies of her new husband in season 2 is ignored here.  Worth watching, though!"
79255,This show is like a modern day western. Great stories with fantastic acting. Start with the first season and work your way forward. You won't regret it.
79256,"I was skeptical because I've had problems linking keys and key fobs in the past with my car.  But this worked flawlessly.  Linked it up in seconds, and it works great.  Seems solid."
79257,"My kids love this show.  When I heard a familiar song in it, I watched and discovered it is from the Mr. Rogers foundation.  A delight to hear these sweet songs again!  It has great messages and songs for young children and not too annoying like some other children's programming...you parents know what I'm taking about!"
79258,"Received this Toro for Father's Day and I love it. Sweeping and raking are two of my least favorite yard chores, and this unit has instantly become one of my indispensible tools. Although I was able to vacuum up green hedge trimmings w/o any real problem, I went ahead and ordered the replacement impeller from the heavy duty Ultra model (they are interchangeable), for an additional $30. I was going to mount it right away, but now have decided to run the plastic one until it breaks or wears, then switch to the magnesium one. It makes sense to do this, as the magnesium impeller is very light, yet this Super unit is 4 lbs less than the Ultra, which helps at the end of the day."
79259,Now that it's done this show ranks in my top ten of all time great shows to ever be on TV.  Where exactly I haven't decided yet (The Wire is still #1--other than that the rest are fair game).  If you haven't seen it watch it from start to finish--it's amazing and worth every minute.
79260,"I got this insecticidal 3-in-1 spray for use in and around my vegetable/flower/herb gardens.  The spray did an excellent job at eliminating the caterpillars from my collard plants.  Whatever was eating my sprawling mint has also disappeared.  The spray also did an effective job at reducing the black spot and leaf spot on my roses. Of course, roses will need repeated application of the product.  I did a general spraying of the other vegetables and flowers in the vicinity. However, as one reviewer pointed out, this spray is best used against visible pests, not as a preventative.I usually have an infestation of whiteflies and aphids by now, but I have not seen them this year, so I cannot comment on the usage of this spray to control those pests.  When they do appear, I will test the spray against them as well.The only downside so far is that my green beans seemed to get some leaf damage from using this product.  Also, I wiped out a tiny (4 leaves) watermelon plant that sprouted from seed.  I would not use this product on young/new plant life.  Other than these minor issues, I have no complaints.  I will also add that spraying a large area can be tiresome and probably wouldn't be suitable for someone who has arthritis.I give this product a green light for general usage around the garden, in flower beds and in herb gardens.  The organic formula should lessen worries about the use of harsh chemical pesticides."
79261,The story telling in this show is superb. The juxtaposition elegant yet almost child-like animation with the standard cinematography you find in well produced shows was refreshing. The children are at once clearly being normal kids yet possessed of a sense of adventure and wit far beyond their years. This was my favorite amazon demo I have seen this season.
79262,Great show. It comes up with ideas for some of histories most controversial stories. Only bad thing is it sometimes gives more questions then answers.
79263,"Love following this series - great action and surprises.  Love the characters, the twists and turns with all the interactions between them."
79264,"Needed this to jump my dead, really dead, batt on my vehicle. It did the job in one turnover, but after having to turn the vehicle off a few times, the charge left was pretty minimal to get another jump. And yes, the thing was fully charged prior to use. But regardless, it jumped me to get me to the stealership to fix my problem and having it really is insurance if any of my other vehicles need it. Solid construction and easily portable. I like that it has a USB charger and the light I'm sure will come in pretty handy. Overall, a great value."
79265,I spent a lot of time on Amazon reading reviews - comparing prices. I wanted an amp that would have overdrive and I also wanted some power. There are so many choices from the small portable units (I was afraid they would sound like toys) to the big units (They would sound great but I couldn't afford them). I am thrilled with the Starcaster. This amp delivers a huge sound and the overdrive sounds great for grunge and metal while you can also play crisp clear rock or country through it. If you want a small amp to take anywhere and be able to show your rock star image - this is the one for you.
79266,Interesting take on Sherlock.  Love Watson!!  Not sure about Sherlock he's just a bit too disordered. Again watch it for Watson
79267,"Nice new draw for Gordon Ramsay.  I wonder if it's censored or uncensored.  I think that this being labed ""FOX"", I would think it's censored.  Can someone tell me this before I buy?  Thanks much..."
79268,"Although I am not completely through season, I have enjoyed the eleven episodes I ave watch.  I paused to was the movie version that was real eased in early March and to go on my trip to St Louis, Mo.  But I do plan to resume binging on Veronica Mars to complete season three.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this show and thank Amazon for making it possible.  The cast, including guests performed superbly and made the show a legend within its rights."
79269,"This series started slow, but picked up during the second half of the first season. For this and the fact that it ended without really finishing the story or letting the viewer know whether it would continue for a fourth season left me some what disappointed."
79270,"Yeah, well, I have no idea what I just watched.  It was like a drunken conversation come to life.  A monster who looks like he escaped from an 80's horror flick like Ghoulies or Troll crawls out of a guy's ass--literally--and kills people who may bring the guy harm or undue stress.First, thank GOD Michael Bay did not make this film.  The plot is up his alley, but I think no one would be able to take his obsession with explosions.  If you get me.Secondly, I have no idea why you might WANT to watch this movie.  You have to be REALLY bored, 12 years old, or just love butt horror.  (Is that a genre now?)Here's why:I love a couple of the cast, so I thought it might be funny.  Unfortunately, it is just slow and silly.  What is funny is that the acting is pretty great!  I guess, if it had been written well, Bad Milo might have been a comedic hit.Instead it is a smirk-fest.  It gets old fast.Give it a try if you love offbeat comedy.  I wanted to like it, but it was just plain dull."
79271,"I tried many expensive wax before even with Perma Plate sole at dealership(dealer will charge $450 for the job) but, NXT generation wax does the same thing at such low price. You can feel the surface just as smooth as PermaPlate. The best of all, if you apply on the trim and rubber part of the car, It will not leave white residue as other product, and gave the car deeper dark (like new) color."
79272,I really enjoyed this series and would recommend to anyone who likes dramas. It is a Cia with in the Police department. sorta like real day cowboys. I did not realize i watched the second season first and it did not matter. all the story lines were very good.
79273,My 3 year old great granddaughter loves this show and watches it on the Kindle before bed.  She never seems to get tired of it.
79274,"The pilot had an excellent pace that kept you in the story the whole hour. I kept wondering what happened to the world, but it was in the back of my head rather than the forefront. I was focused on the characters and what they were going through. Carter shows have great characters and this was no exception. The best part of the episode was that it never dives too deeply into any of the common aspects of the end of the world storyline. Those stories are there, but they do not dominate."
79275,"I watched Tim & Eric on Cartoon Network while channel surfing and thought &#34;Wow, they have some weird looking people on this show.&#34; I watched this movie and laughed so hard. Many times I was like, that's so wrong and wanted to stop watching, but I couldn't.  Gross, lewd, outrageous, but hillariously funny!"
79276,"As a pro musician, I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board, I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner, Digital Delay (2 of them), Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really, really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the ""On"" position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars, especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
79277,I really enjoyed this mystery! Kept you going til the end. The characters are great and the acting is so good!
79278,"This is the one you want! The key to a really good grill is to make sure that all the surface will heat equally and evenly, some grills do not have the flames arranged for this to occur. And some grills simply do not have enough places with flames for the grill to ever be able to have an all over surface temp, in other words you will get hot and cold spots. It is easy to determine if a grill meets the criteria. Simply remove the grill plates ( or in this case, review pictures carefully) and examine how many flame jets there are, if the jets extend close enough to the other jets and outward enough to provide that even, equal heat over the whole surface area. This grill meets the criteria perfectly. This grill is dependable and provides the perfect cooking results time after time. Assembly was no problem, I did have to use the instructions in a couple of places though."
79279,Well made and a perfect fit.  It discolored to a more gold color after use but it fits and works fine
79280,"Off the wall, loser girls in NYC&#8230;.hilariously bumbling through life.  Definitely raunchy, but witty&#8230;.a much more modern and US version of &#34;Absolutely Fabulous&#34;.  Women behaving badly.  Love it."
79281,"I have used wire tomato cages for years, and have found that they are have their limits. The wires do tend to get bent, and adjusting mid season for new growth in plants becomes increasingly difficult.The advantage of this tomato cage is how it can be adjusted as the growing season goes along, and because the plastic making up the stakes is firm, yet flexible, it does not have the bending problems that traditional wire cages have.The ability to adjust the height of the supports is very useful, as the plant grows throughout the year.As a product for long term use, I cannot seeing this having the issues that traditional wire cages have."
79282,"This is a reasonably robust stand that easily carries an 88-key keyboard.  The front-back spread on the legs is a little too narrow for stage applications, but having room underneath for pedals is a huge improvement over the more-common 'X' stand."
79283,"I hooked this up easily. There's good water flow and no leaks, and the two shutoff levers give you control over where the water is directed. No problems."
79284,"I really enjoy gritty westerns, epecially any with Clint Eastwood, so I like many were amazed with HBO's three season run of Deadwood. Hell on Wheels is nearly as dirty and raw, minus the language and nudity, as that show, but a couple of episodes ran rather slow and at times some scenes were unbelievable. The acting is solid throughout and the main character (featured on the DVD cover) who happens to look like Daniel Day-Lewis is someone I've never heard of before, but does a solid job. Even rapper Common proves he has some acting ability in the sidekick role.Miss Deadwood? Check out the weaker but still entertaining Hell on Wheels."
79285,"awesome product, super comfy handles and will hold almost any weight.  I've had 250lb friends support their weight on these, so they will suffice for almost any application."
79286,"This product doesn't come with instructions. A few lines of instructions are printed on the label which is stuck to the bottom of the product. Those instructions are hardly legible and are hard to understand.However, I have read the other reviews before beginning to use the item, so I knew how to operate it. It didn't leak because I took the precautions suggested by other users.We have a number of hummingbirds in our back yard. However, they would not go to this feeder, but rather go to the flowers in the yard. According to my wife, some of the hummingbirds occassionally visited the feeder, but the syrup in the feeder lasted quite a few weeks.I noticed that the feeder was empty last week. I am not sure if the birds consumed the liquid, or the wind just spilled everything. So, I refilled the feeder over the weekend with 1:4 solution. Feeder is still full after two days. I think the birds rather go to real flowers than come to this feeder.I think I will drain the feeder and put it for recycling."
79287,"good intensity, Hinds is great, great energy between the actors. well written story that maintains my attention. I do recommend."
79288,"Bought Verbzilla, Digitech RV-7, and the verbzilla's ripoff : Behringer RV600.The types of reverb i get from Verbzilla is very insignificant to be used for my synths .. so for that many kind of modes, barely useful. And I HATE the fact that line 6 always used the MIX knob instead of the separated level and reverb/fx level, cos you have to sacrifice your volume to get an extreme reverb, which is sucks.Then i tried the digitech rv-7. First thought was .. Wow, what a construction it's got there. Fancy knobs, and additional stuffs like thick rubberized knobs cover, velcro, glow in the dark sticker. And the fact that it has the lexicon soul in it. I love this one better than the verbzilla, cos you don't have to sacrifice the volume to get a heavy reverb.. but the problem was .. there's no heavy reverb there. I couldn't get a ridiculous amount of reverb out of this pedal. But I love the gated reverb feature among all modes. Every other modes are just nothing special really. It was just a light reverb i get.Aaaand finally i tried this blue thick plastic pedal .. skeptical at first, and i can see that it has also the mix knob like verbzilla has I was a little disappointed. But I really can sense my juno 60 and my moog sings differently on each modes with this one. And I'm very happy that the mix and the decay could go ridiculous without having volume loss as much as the verbzilla does. It could be painful for guitar players, cos they cannot boost up your guitar volume without anything else if it's already full, but I could always gain the volume of my synth to balance it with the mix knob (since i never put the volume knob on the synth at full). I could sense the difference of each modes with this pedal and it's hell loads of them.Let me tell you the ugly truth about those 3 pedals that i've tried.. they are ALL battery hogs! It was ridiculous .. i mean bad bad ridiculous that it was only lasted about 5-10 mins of nonstop use of battery before it's dried up. So I suggest you to use the power adapter. And the only thing i hate about RV600 is the way that we have to put back the battery cover to it's place cos we have to put the spring back to it's track while closing it slowly, and that black plastic latch on the side doesn't feel it could last longI don't care what ppl said about this pedal, but it's been very useful for me and my synthesizers, we don't need to get an expensive gears as long as we can make great sounds. It's all comes back to our ability to make good music. Good luck guys!"
79289,"An essay by David Mamet turned me on to George V. Higgins, and, completest that I am, I devoured all his novels.  He is the smartest dialogue writer I have ever read.  Last year's &#34;Killing Them Softly&#34; got the wit, zing, and poetry just right, and the delivery by Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini was  amazing.Robert Mitchum is more realistic in his approach, so, while the dialogue is not delivered with the great timing of Pitt and Gandolfini, his physical presence is completely believable as the low-level mobster, Eddie Coyle.Otherwise, kind of plodding."
79290,"Have had this trap for about a week, set and baited with peanut butter. Adjusted the trigger as best I could for sensitivity.  Had one sprung trap, but didn't catch the rat.  Rebaited and waiting.  This may be a case of my not being a good trapper...though have the trap set up against the wall as per the instructions.  I don't care for the pictures shown on the amazon page instructions, as they seem to be misleading to me.  It would be easy to dispose of a dead rat, as the trap basicallly works like a huge spring loaded clothes pin...with teeth.  Clean, easy to set with foot or hands, a bit difficult to remove from packaging."
79291,"It couldn't keep my kids ages 3-14 entertained, it was a waste of time.  watched different apposed and it was the same.  it's not like the old one"
79292,"I use this little guy in connection with my DAW and digital piano.  I run the piano sounds through balanced cables into the line-in ports for recording, and I also run VST intruments on my DAW that I trigger via USB MIDI from the piano and use this device for digital/audio conversion.  I listen through Sennheser HD 595 headhphones plugged in to this and I also have some studio monitors attached using balanced cables.I purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface, the Behringer UF0202.  That device worked quite well for this purpose as well but lacked two things: a volume knob, and balanced in/outs.  The volume knob thing I could work around, but my current monitors seem susceptible to ground loops (even with a ground lift plug), so I needed to go with balanced cables.  I'm glad I did.  The balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems.  This was a good purchase.  However, I would say to anyone who doesn't need balanced cables and is on a budget that they should consider the Behringer.  It's a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well.  Further, it's class complaint so you don't have to use Behringer's drivers.  It's plug-and-play.I have some good things to say about the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (all about the hardware) and some bad things (all about the software).  I've tried using the driver version 2.1, which came with the disk, and the udpated 2.2, which I downloaded from Focusrite's website.To let you know what I need in an interface:1. Balanced stereo in/out2. High quality headphone amp3. Volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line4. Good digital-to-analog conversion5. Low output latency (input latency not important to me)I don't use the Mic preamps, which is one of the big selling points of this device.================ The Good ====================This box is simple and well-designed.  It does what you want, has very convenient controls, and has high build quality.  I'm pleased with the digital-to-analog conversion.  It has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp.  It has switches so each input can be a line-in or microphone pre-amp.  It has a switch for zero-latency monitoring (of whatever is coming in).* The headphone amp was of particular concern for me.  I use headphones a lot and a poor headphone amp can be quite a problem.  The Behringer headphone amp was only ok.  Specifically, it has an output impedance of 50 ohms.  The rule of thumb for good headphone/amp matching is that the output impedance should be 1/8 the impedance of the headphones--my hd 595's have 50 ohms of impedance.  Breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response.  In my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass.  Most manufacturers don't list their output impedance, possibly because they are embarrassed.  Anyway, Focusrite does, which is one reason I trust them a little more.  The output impedance is less than 10 ohms--respectable but not amazing.  Still not as low as I would need in principle but I can notice an improvement in the bass response in my headphones.  There's plenty of extra voltage here too, so I could drive higher impedance cans if necessary.  Anyway, good headphone amp.  Check.* Balanced ins and outs work very well,  The ins accommodates a 1/4 TRS style in and XLR.  The light around them shows when something's actually coming in and shines red when it's in danger of clipping.  There's lots of gain available.  I have them turned all the way down almost.  The outs are TRS style (balanced or unbalanced) and are located on the back.* I like the look of the box, with a red metal case, and the front and back are sturdy and attractive as well.* The USB cable is just a type B port.  This means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever.  The Behringer, for example, was hard-wired to its cable...king of annoying.* It's bus-powered.  I actually would have been fine with a wall-wart, but this is even more simple.I really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware.===================== The Bad =========================The driver for this thing is horrible under Windows XP.  I have a clean installation with nothing installed except my DAW software, acrobat reader, and this driver.  I mean, my computer is really stripped down.  Performance using the Behringer was good.  The latency (time between playing a note and hearing it out the speakers) was 8 ms using the Behringer, which isn't really perceptible.Unfortunately the focusrite driver, though it's technically ASIO apparently, doesn't have anything like an acceptable latency.  The lowest latency I could set it at and get sound out instead of crackles and pops was 23 ms.  At that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy.  It's very difficult, at least for me, to work with a large latency like that.I was ready to return this device when I decided as a last ditch effort to install ASIO4ALL.  That's sort of an ASIO driver to use if you absolutely cannot make the manufacturer's driver perform at a decent level.  I installed it and it worked.  The output latency was a tiny 4.3 ms (only .3 of which are actually output latency, so this is REALLY impressive).  I conclude that the hardware is very, very good in this machine, but the software is horrible.Unfortunately, you can't actually uninstall the focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesn't recognize the device and it never even turns on--it's not class compliant, unlike the Behringer.  So now I have two drivers for it installed, only one of which I use.The bad news is that this configuration is very buggy.  In general when I just turn the computer on and try and play my VST instrument, all I get is crackles and pops until I open the ASIO configuration panel and increase the buffer.  The funny thing is that it doesn't matter where the buffer starts out, I always have to increase it before I get any good sounds out.  I can start it out with a huge buffer--lots of latency--and it will crackle until I open it and increase the buffer yet more.  I have to do this every time I turn on the computer.  Also, sometimes if I leave it on for a while and come back, it will be crackly again until I increase it yet another step. We are talking about major bugs here.I decided to try ditching ASIO4ALL and trying to make the focusrite drivers work again--maybe there was a setting I was missing.  As I was trying to set the buffer size, I heard the sound of an explosion and then my computer rebooted.  When it came back I couldn't get good sounds out, even when I turned the buffer way up.  Tried rebooting a few more times, still didn't work.  So I uninstalled and re-installed the focusrite software.  At first it didn't work.  I had to install ASIO4ALL as well, and now I can sort of get sounds out of it, half the time.I hope you are getting the idea.  These drivers are terrible.  Awful.  A monkey could have written a better driver.  I would give it 1 star if it wasn't for the fact that the device works very, very well when all the stars align and the driver recognizes the drive and allows it to play.  I guess I'm willing to sacrifice convenience and stability for nice hardware when it works.  I would never use this in a live situation or when time is critical.The good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them.  I'm hoping for that.  They have already revised the driver once, which is amazing because even the 2.2 driver is seriously an abomination, just like the 2.1.================ Closing Thoughts =======================Unfortunately, there really isn't a USB interface that has a good driver.  The Behringer driver always worked, but if you moved the interface from one USB port to the other, it was no longer recognized and you had to reinstall the driver.  However, you didn't have to use the Behringer driver and ASIO4ALL would give you 11 ms and perform without any complications.  That's about as trouble free as I've seen in this type of device.If you read about the Presonus Audiobox USB and the M-Audio Fast Track Pro (probably the two closest competitors to this focusrite), what you get is a bunch of comments just like this one...horrible, horrible drivers that never get fixed. Actually Mackie makes a competitor as well, the Onyx Blackjack--but the reviews of that show that the driver is possibly even worse than this one. Unfortunately none of the pro music manufacturers cares about their drivers, so we have to live with unstable systems that only work half the time.  Maybe it's better under mac.  I don't know.Interestingly, this is really the only USB 2.0 device in this range.  That's quite shocking considering how long the USB 2.0 standard has been around.  The only real implication of this is that the USB 1.1 devices like the M-Audio and Presonus can only do two channel 24/96 audio in OR out, not both at the same time.  There's not enough throughput in USB 1.1.So in light of the competition, the Focusrite looks kind of ok.  Unfortunately all audio interface manufacturers--at least in this range of device--think there's no need for good hardware and (especially) good software.  At least the hardware in this one is up to spec.  We can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future.Bottom line: this is a fantastic, 5-star device...if you can make the software work consistently.If you are on a tight budget or don't care about balanced in/out, I'd recommend you go with the Behringer UCA202 or UFO2020.  They are tons cheaper, class complaint, and have better drivers.  If you use a high impedance headphone with it, even the headphone amp is pretty good on that one.================ Update May 2012 ==============A new version of the driver, 2.3, came out since the writing of the above.  The new driver actually works.  I have stopped using ASIO4ALL and I get decent latency.  Once in a while--not too often--it will inexplicably require me to edit the settings and increase the buffer, and some percentage of the time when I do that it will reboot my computer.  If I don't change anything, most of the time, it works ok.  I would never use this in a mission-critical setting (i.e., gigging or pro work), but for my home use, it's good enough now.  If you have issues with the driver, definitely update."
79293,I've always liked reading Agatha Christie but I'm enthralled with David Suchet as Poirot.  I like the deductive reasoning and the scenery is so amazing and filming techniques are wonderful.
79294,"This is a light heart, yet heart felt, movie about the trials and tribulations of being young. being accepted, and falling in love. One minute no one loves you, the next you have three people in love with you. What's a girl to do?"
79295,"No where on the description does it say that the mic clip is NOT included.  The only place is on the box AFTER you have received the item.  There's no instruction (which is fine). But in the product description it doesn't say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can't use it.I bought this and have it shipped second day because I need to use it and now I can't because it doesn't come with a Mic Clip which I have to spend another 5-10 to get it plus shipping.  The price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip.  But without it, I felt cheated."
79296,This is not my favorite TV show.  If it wasn't free on Amazon Prime I am not sure I would purchase it.  It is too dull.
79297,"This thing is incredibly cool.  Double the record time of the closest competitor- the TC Ditto- and about twenty bucks cheaper.  Your loop can be as long as 10 minutes, with unlimited over-dubbing.  This pedal sold out in about a day on most of the big retailers- likely due to pre-order obligations and a delayed release.  It was worth the wait.  You can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music.  It's a really cool tool for jamming, performing, or composing.  Operation is simple- press once to record.  Press again and it begins playback.  Press a third time to dub on top of your last layer.  If you make a mistake, press and hold- it will erase your last dub.  Tap twice to stop play of the loop.  Press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing.  Switch is a soft switch, so there is no click.  It is very responsive to pressure.  There is a single knob to control the volume of the loop.  Nicely done, Digitech ;)"
79298,"Beautiful and sturdy feeder. It is easy to fill, holds a lot of seed, and the ability to have two types of seed in it makes it doubly enjoyable. The perches do make it possible for larger birds like starlings and grackles to feed, so don't be surprised if they empty you out- but any feeder with a perch will have the same problem. They cannot comfortably perch for long here- perches are narrow and close to the seed tube itself, so there is a lot of flapping about as they snag at the seed they can get.Overall it is an excellent feeder and a welcome addition to the others I have in the yard."
79299,"What a delightful series.  Never even heard of it before.  Only watched because I found it on Amazon Prime.  The dialogue between Harvey and Mike is snappy, funny, and quite entertaining.  Can't wait to start watching season 2."
79300,"Hi, it was great to get to watch these episodes (The Ark In Space) that I never saw before, especially on Prime.  But...most of the season's episodes are not available. If they had everything available including classics about the Daleks, Crinoids, etc. this series would be a home-run. Also, Tom Baker is my favorite childhood version of Dr. Who, which is another reason why I would love to see everything featuring him available on Amazon Instant Video."
79301,"I&#8217;ve been using Milorganite for years &#8211; works great, no leaching, no burning, just a nice green lawn. It&#8217;s not as quick as the chemical fertilizers in that there&#8217;s no overnight &#8220;pop&#8221; of green. But, over time, the lawn is far more healthy and disease-resistant than when I used non-organic fertilizers.I was interested to see if this provided any benefits over Milorganite. So far, I don&#8217;t notice any. It works much the same &#8211; no burning, no leaching, and easy to apply. Rather than the fine-grained dark particles that Milorganite of composed of, this has larger granules that are tan in color. They look sort of &#8220;puffed,&#8221; which makes it easy to see when you&#8217;re applying it. There's no significant smell from the product.The performance is 5-star. No complaints there at all. But, given that Milorganite performs just as well and comes in at a notably lower cost, I&#8217;ll give this 4-stars. Works well, but pricey compared to alternatives."
79302,Light weight and efficient.  Much easier to use than the blocks of wood I have used in the past because I'm cheap.
79303,It is so fun to watch the items in their completion.  I am constantly amazed though at the amount of money people will spend to get something restored.  Wow!
79304,"My 2 year old has watched this show since he was 1. He loves it so much that he sleeps with his Millie, Geo and Bot dolls and loves to play with the vehicles and figures. He counts to 15 like a champ and we are always working on more. He knows his shapes too! We work with him too but a lot comes from the show. It's amazing!"
79305,"This is how I choose movies from the Roku my husband got for his birthday from my daughter.  It was a tense and unsettling to watch and a satisfying end.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I waited too long to write this and think I would remember it better if it were 5 star material.  Still think I'll be watching it again, which is a good test of the experience."
79306,"I use it on my Honda civic/mustang/Porsche/and Nissan and it leaves the paint nice and waxed looking(very very clean) every time! My Nissans paint is very worn in some spots like the roof, yet after washing(and several days after) it's still very clean and waxed looking.Highly recommend this product, it's very sudsy and cleans great leaving a nice deep reflective shine."
79307,"I have watched all of the Bering Sea Gold seasons so far and am addicted to them. They are very intense and interesting. I am also friends with a few of the folks being filmed so this makes it more intriging.I also wish it was on every evening. But if it was the public would get bored with it.I Thank Discovery Channel and Amazon for bringing this to us,what EXCITING entertainment!!"
79308,"I have been wanting to get a code reader for some time to check on check engine light codes. This one not only checks the codes for all newer OBCD-II vehicles and allows you to clear them, but will scan some ABS codes as well. This code reader is half the price than the same one from my local auto parts store. Great value for a good product. My only complaint is that the cable included with the reader for the computer is serial port instead of USB and most modern computers do not have serial ports anymore."
79309,I didn't want to watch this show. I accidentally watched the pilot and fell in love.  Now I buy all the episodes so that I can watch them commercial free.  I have watched them all at least 6. It never gets boring.  It romantic and exciting and who's done it all combined.  I for one love their costumes.
79310,"Watching  this for the third time, but I'm enjoying it as if were the first time.  I don't understand why there have been no follow ups to the sereies, seems perfect for a what happens when they cross the great divide."
79311,"I bought these for two reasons: 1 - I paint a lot (walls).  2 - I have little nieces and nephews who like to ride on my back as I crawl on the floor!  For the former, they work great-  they don't add any weight to me as I walk around and go up and down ladders, etc.  I can get on the floor and paint near the baseboard while on my knees.  It's great.  My knees aren't the best and these help a lot!  For the latter reason, they're great too!  I can quickly get these on and then let one or two (or three!) of my plentiful and beligerent nieces and nephews ride on my back around the house!  Good excercise and quite tiring!  But for the price - you can't go wrong."
79312,"These have the correct thickness and texture that I want, but they are smaller than a typical pick. So be sure to try them out first before buying. One just cannot tell the size from the picture Amazon has. I wish they put a reference picture by the side of this pick (may be dim the ref image a little so people won't get confused). Some people swear by these, but I that find my fingers get a little numb after playing these for an hour or two. May be you need to get acclimated to this pick before you can fully use it effectively and for long duration. I won't be buying these again."
79313,An amazing show. I watch this on Amazon Prime; I gave up on cable a few years ago but this show almost makes me want to go back to it....NOT!
79314,One of the best scifi series on tv.  Very good graphics and a very interesting unfolding storyline.  I would highly recommend it to any scifi enthusiast.  Not far fetched.
79315,"There are simply too many good things to say about Breaking Bad, but I'll just name a couple.  The acting, if you are an actor or someone who just loves good acting, this show is a must.  There is not one bad actor in the entire cast.  Bryan Cranston blows me away week after week and I will not name anyone else on this show because they are all equally amazing.  The writing is flawless and it keeps you wanting more after each show.  I get bored very easily and it has been a long time since I gave a show enough time to get me hooked.  However, Breaking Bad like Meth is a very strong addiction because it keeps you wanting more and more.  I'm in Season 6 and all I have to say is I feel like I was punched in the stomach and had heart has been ripped out.  Enough said!!"
79316,"I truly love Stephen Colbert and his seamless, unflinching portrayal of a man clinging to right-wing ideologue. Always funny and on the mark."
79317,These are perfect strings for a gig or a long practice session. The strings keep their tone for a long time. Can easily last upto a month on daily practice for 2-3 hours.
79318,"I don't need to do a long review to convey the basics that this pin works perfectly to secure your hitch to the receiver.  There's a little anodized flare, and a decent little rubber cap to keep the grit out of the lock mechanism and it's stainless steel to boot!  Nice quality item."
79319,"I use this and some semi-chrome polish to clean my wheels and it gets in the tight places where the larger ball won't go.Washable, see internet instructions. Problem here: Too high priced to just throw away. I get about 3 washes to one of these and that makes it affordable. Is not use and toss for me."
79320,I needed quite a &#34;rise&#34; for my van hitch so I found this one here on Amazon. When flipped over it has a 4 inch rise and was perfect. I love these mounts because they have the interlock system which make it easy to tighten the ball onto the mount.
79321,It is a real shame this well written and acted series is not going to continue after season five.  An adult show that doesn't insult your intelligence.
79322,"This is a movie which makes my heart sing.  Delightful, hopeful, wonderful. The whole family can enjoy this with smiles at the end."
79323,"Very imaginative story lines, beautifully acted and gorgeous scenery. What could you ask for more? Looking forward to the next series!"
79324,Loved it from the first scene. Just having a hard time with everyone smoking. Please consider lightening g that up like they did in Mad Men. Thanks
79325,"I bought a season pass to this by accident, and I am very sorry I did. The nicest thing I can say about this show is that it's marginally better than Agents of Shield. It's too bad really, because it has a good cast and I do like how they are trying to tell two stories at the same time, but the script writing and editing are lacking in continuity and common sense, and all the characters have the emotional maturity of eight year olds.I get that I'm not the target demographic for this show, but I'd like to think teenagers don't appreciate gaping plot holes and senseless melodrama either. :p"
79326,"Hard to beat the daystar switches, they're quality made and the price here is nearly impossible to match elsewhere, you won't be disappointed."
79327,"I'm not going to do any explaining about the ""science"" behind how this pedal works. I'm just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone. This definitely isn't a boost, and it's also not an eq, the BBE sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal. To the ear, it serves to add clarity, depth, and body to your tone. Essentially, this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing.The lo contour knob doesn't ""increase"" the amount of bass produced by the amp. Rather, it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass (and low mid) tone. To the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased, but it hasn't. You're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place, that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp.The process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies. These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear, and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh.That's not to say that you can't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something; indeed, it'll make those searing lead tones even better.Now, I gave this product 4 stars not because I've had any issues with it or haven't been in any way unsatisfied with it; but rather because it's really a fairly subtle effect. At first I almost couldn't tell a difference between having it on and off. With time I've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone, but it doesn't make a ""night and day"" difference.I recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you're happy with, and just want to make it even better. This pedal won't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack. It won't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before.In conclusion, though I definitely wouldn't put this pedal into the ""must have"" category, it definitely improves the quality of my tone. This is a pedal that I leave on all the time, as it improves both clean and distorted tones."
79328,"A Lonely Place To Die is a very Atmospheric film that not only has beautiful scenery and cinematography but also packs a punch as far as storyline and execution.The Acting is first rate and it is what it is, there really aren't any big aha moments or unexpected twists.The group of mountain climbers are in a race for their lives and the life of the little girl they saved from a man made underground prison.Many lives will be lost be it the pursuers and /or the Climbers.The main question is why do the men with heavy artillery chasing them want the girl so bad,where did she come from and will she be returned safety and will any of the climbers be alive to make sure she is?One of the best adventure/suspense thrillers of the year in my opinion because it's no nonsense and cuts right to the literal chase.There is quite a bit of violence and blood but nothing that put's it in Slasher mode although I have seen many slashers with less blood.Bottom line it's well worth a rent and even a buy."
79329,"Well, I don't need much from the hose that this was attached to--only need it for short, hand-held jobs.  But one good thing about my hose is that it is safe to drink water from it.  Enter this item that contains lead, and that advantage is gone.  No problems, though.  I never have needed to drink from my hose.  I'm happy I purchased this item, which will be permanently attached to the hose on one side of my house."
79330,"The premise that there exists an &#34;intelligence think tank&#34; is believable, if for no other purpose than to bring a different perspective to the analysis and interpretation of specific data.  The premise that there exists in the very deep shadows an organization that is interested in making huge amounts of money by influencing national policies and priorities is also believable.  The acting is good and you are kept in the dark as to who is on the &#34;good&#34; side thanks to very good writers.  I hope someday there is at least another season.  From the very first episode, I could see the similarity with &#34;Three Days of the Condor&#34;, which I also found to be quite credible."
79331,"Don't get me wrong, these containers are nice for transplanting starter plants from a greenhouse kit into the garden, but don't expect the peat container to dissolve any time soon. My suggestion would be to cut some slits in the bottom and side before you transplant these into your garden or container so the roots can actually leave the container."
79332,"I find the characters likable, even the ones who are more unlikable. Always entertaining. None of the people are perfect and all are rounded out with a sense of both seriousness and humor. Plot lines are wonderfully engaging."
79333,i use this product all the time for many of my plants in my container garden. it does a good job and seems to be a good quality product. i don't see how just trying one bag could cause a problem for anyone. i am happy with this purchase and i buy several bags at a time. thank you.
79334,Don't why people like this so much.  It's not bad.  I like genuine leather chamois so much better because it doesn't leave streaks on glass windows and it cleans up the water and any leftover dirt on the car better.  This product can get moldy because you have to store it damp in the plastic container it comes with.
79335,"Answers to Nothing almost became a 3-star movie but thanks to the final 30 minutes making a dramatic improvement in storytelling, it's only fair to award it 4 stars.  It's about four separate stories happening at once, and I'll list them right now:1- Dane Cook is NOT a comedian in this film.  Let that be known right off the bat.  Instead he cheats on his wife with a woman who looks and sings remarkably similar to the legendary Patti Smith.  As you can guess, he's cheating because he doesn't get along with his wife.  Unfortunately there's a few exceptionally graphic and inappropriate sexual related scenes in the very beginning that I didn't really care for, however I suppose having ""it"" happen during a story about a World War II soldier parachuting down to a house in France with an attractive inside is an interesting spin.  You'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.2- An African American woman who has a certain hatred for other black folks and seeks help with a counselor to figure out why.  Sort of pointlessly weaved into the storyline if you ask me, since if you were to remove this segment it wouldn't have been a big loss.3- An attractive blonde-haired detective woman who wants to bring down a potential suspect involved in the abduction of a child that she strongly believes is responsible for the childs disappearance.  Unfortuantely this segment was *severely* lacking.  At least, the scenes involving the detective.  There's a REALLY good segment with the suspect near the end concerning a house break-in that's easily the best part of the movie.4- A woman who has to take care of her paralyzed brother by bathing and taking him for walks in his wheelchair.  I suppose her intention here is to get into proper running shape so she can continue to have the strength to take care of him, but the fact that she was in desperate need of assistance because of how straining of a job it was leads to some interesting segments with her family later on, and especially memorable is the running marathon segment near the end.The only problem is that on a few occasions the storyline really drags, especially from the 30 minute mark until the 1 hour and 15 minute mark.  That's a good 45 minutes of lackluster entertainment that tells a decent enough story to get the job done, but never does anything that truly stands out.  This is why it's quite difficult to give the movie 5 stars.  However the ending is REALLY darn good- all the events are convincingly and thoroughly explained by the conclusion.  Good movie."
79336,"Well, I think this series would be great for mystery science theater review.  I like the campy quality of the series  but die hard scifi fans probably won't like it.  I would like to give a nod to a Downton Abbey star who plays a significant role in this series.  Can you pick out the actor?"
79337,"great reality tv at its best  CHARACTERS ARE BELEIVABLE  the people are strong,scenery is interesting,friendly and show a whole new view. It is filmed well.Unbelievable how big the gattors grow to be."
79338,"Say it all, but the replacement is milled finer and has better threads than the original piece.  A great upgrade when adding new parts to the inexpensive but fantastic Squire."
79339,Great quality casters for the money! Just as good or better quality than the ones that come stock on most amps. You can't go wrong with these.
79340,"Mosquito Magnet MM4100 Patriot Mosquito TrapThis little guy right here came be a big help if you live where I do, right here in the very hot state of Texas. The mosquito are out at all times so anything that will kill these guys off when we are trying to grill or are just out side a good thing to me. If you have never had a run in with these little guys then let me tell you they suck, literally. I am not a fan of these miniature vampires  but they always seem to be a fan of me. Are they pests you ask, well yes they are because they can carry disease.Now I am never a fan of just killing something to kill it but that last sentence above seems to be a good reason to kill them. Any way this little thing workers great and can cover an acre or so I believe. Now this thing attracts them much like humans do but instead of getting blood taken it takes blood ""hahahahah"". Any way that is the simplest way I can describe it and that is basically what it does. I could go into an advanced tell all of how to do this but I think you can get it."
79341,"This windshield cleaner does the job.  It's great for getting into the corners and along all the hard to reach spots on windshields.  Especially on those sloped interior windshields most modern cars have.  On the inside, it's the way to go.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
79342,"I used it to apply waxes, with cleaners, and for leather care products and they held up well.The foam is a bit denser than the Lexol pads and the terry cloth feels softer.When I clean my leather handbags, shoes and sofas, I like to use these terry cloth pads because they help with rubbing away grime and stains better than just the microfiber cloth. If I just condition the leather, then I use the microfiber cloths.I washed them and put them in the washer, even put them in the dryer and they are fine.Obviously, they don't last forever and depending on how soiled you get them, they last longer or shorter.These pads are the great value, a pack of 6 for about $5.17, that is about $0.86 for one pad."
79343,I love this show and these personalities that make their way through &#34;history&#34;.  They seek to uncover truth and get justice in knowing the truth.  It shows what people can bring to this need and it shows how far they will go or where they will draw their lines.  It is full of energy and acknowledgement of human frailties and courageous strength of mind and character.
79344,I used this little guy on a dead battery in a Corvette and it cranked it over with no problem and fired up in seconds. I will keep this in the car and it is smaller and weighs less than those bigger ones and has about the same power. This was a good investment  and a great price.
79345,"When it comes to air freshners that last, this Chemical Guys is the best stuff to use. I have tried a ton of different fragances from the trees, to the wooden pads, to the gels, i find this works the best. The scent is nice and subtle and smells great. I always use more than recommended though since I have a larger truck. I also purchased the Leather Scent and Stripper scent to change it up. And even have my younger brother purchasing as well. Keep up the good work Chemical Guys.Also use other Chemical Guys products ( gallon car wash ) thats a big plus too. Nice and soapy."
79346,I gave this movie 5 stars because it was very enjoyable and not your &#34;run of the mill&#34; story line.  I wasn't expecting what I saw and when that happens I tend to enjoy the movie much more.  When it is made available for purchase I will be buying it as I feel it has re playability.
79347,this filter costs 3-4 more at the store and with free shipping there is no reason you shouldn't get this filter. It should allow you to change the filter every other oil change if you change every 3000.
79348,"Had Redline MT90 transmission fluid in my 2008 Mazdaspeed3 for about 1200 miles.  Although Redline was recommended on some online forums, it did not work well for me when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear until the car was warmed up. If the temperature where you live is always above 50 degrees Redline would probably be fine in this vehicle.  Anyway, I replace the Redline fluid with Ford XT-M5-QS fluid and that has solved my problem. All shifts feel buttery smooth and the car is a pleasure to drive again."
79349,The RV park that I have set up in has terrible water both smell and taste. I am used to bottle water so the drinking was not as important to me but the smell had to go. This has worked like a dream.
79350,"I really liked this,My 2000 jeep cherokee threw a CEL and read 2 codes.  The insttruction manual has a index where it tells you what each code means.This can really help the home mechanic or at least give you an idea if its something you can handle or need to take to a shop."
79351,The carebear series teaches the young children about feelings and how to express them. All this in an entertaining story.
79352,"Judge Josh Rode, DVD Verdict-- The Bang Bang Club doesn't have a strong narrative arc; it is more a group character study than a true story. The summation of the film is this: novice photographer Greg Marinovich (Ryan Phillippe, Flags of Our Fathers) makes a name for himself by going where few would dare to tread--into a Zulu compound--and witnesses the brutal slaying of an outsider. His bold move gets him a spot with The Star newspaper, and soon he is whizzing around South Africa with three other photographers. They spend their days finding all the hot spots and clicking away with their cameras at everything they see. But the more pictures of death and despair they take, the more walled off they get from their emotions and the people around them.There's a fine line between chronicling events and being a part of them; lacking a traditional plot, this dichotomy is what carries the film forward. Greg is present when a man is executed. He tries to stop it, but his protests only make him a target, and he finds himself helpless to do anything but take pictures as the victim is set on fire and then chopped down with a machete. The resulting picture wins him a Pulitzer...and haunts him every day.The other photographers are immersed in the same situation and deal with it in their own ways. Kevin Carter (Taylor Kitsch, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) turns to drugs and alcohol, only to find that they add to his problems instead of alleviating them. He wins his own Pulitzer when he takes a shot of a child apparently being stalked by a vulture, but his joy of winning is quickly tempered by the hordes of people denouncing him for taking pictures instead of helping.Silver does a fantastic job of finding the balance to keep the film moving without dipping into cynicism. Instead, the audience gets to feel the rush of adrenaline that comes from being surrounded by hostile crowds with weapons and a very low tolerance toward outsiders. We understand the need to keep a camera between the horrors being witnessed and the cameraman's soul. The Bang Bang Club is very much a war movie, and just like a soldier who can't afford to think about what he's doing when he's spearing an enemy with a bayonet, the photographers must keep their distance from their surroundings or risk going mad.On the other hand, the audience recognizes the cold-hearted nature of taking a picture of a starving child who's about to become a vulture's dinner and then walking away once the picture is snapped. What this movie does so well is teeter-totter between these opposing mindsets without relieving us of the burdens of either issue.The principal actors are superlative. Phillippe is the weakest of the four, but he also has the longest character arc and the most to do. Frank Rautenbach (Hansie) brings a quiet confidence as Ken Ossterbroek, the leader of the group, and Neels Van Jaarsveld (Goodbye Bafana) plays Joao Silva as alternately terse and spastic. He comes across very much like the real Silva does during the ""Making of"" segment. Kitsch steals the show as the laidback Kevin. His easy smile lights up the screen and he has a smooth, natural charisma that makes him the unconscious focus of every shot he's in. I only wish they had re-created the real Kevin's haunted eyes; Kitsch looks much too bright and innocent for someone who has witnessed his character's life. Casting Director Deirdre Bowen (The Red Violin) deserves a huge heaping of credit for finding this group of relative unknowns, especially since they all look remarkably similar to their real-life counterparts.The secondary characters aren't given more than a quick basecoat characterization. The Star's editor is rumpled and fearful of printing anything too controversial. The photo editor strikes up a relationship with Greg but aside from one ""I can't do this"" scene where she gets a taste of Greg's world, she doesn't really grow. The other photographer's girlfriends are given even shorter shrift; we're told their names, but little else. More's the pity, since the best scene in the film is Viv's response to Joao's proposal.The 1080p 2.35:1 anamorphic transfer comes across well in most cases, with excellent balance. The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is good too, although more use could have been made of the surround speakers. I never felt surrounded, even though the photographers often were.The director's commentary is great, full of insight into all aspects of the film and the characters. The forty-five minute ""Making of"" featurette is likewise great, which is a rare treat. The extra not to be missed is the cast and crew interview segment by Kgosi Mongake. There are also deleted scenes, every one of which was a good cut, and a short slideshow of production pictures.-Full review dvdverdict.com"
79353,I love the puzzles these Agatha Christie movies present partly because the director and the actors are so good.
79354,It's a swere hose so what can you say about it.  It seems well built.  It is much better than what I hade.  Just make sure the &#34;O&#34; ring is in place or it will leak like no tomorow.
79355,Would like to see more.  Difficult to really say how well we liked it.  Need to see more to give a better opinion.  Story did not totally but we would watch more episodes.
79356,I didn't know what to expect. But this is hard to stop watching. It's gripping. And they picked the right actor to play the psycho king. Worth watching.
79357,This was a great film! If you are looking to forget about your problems and laugh you a** off this is the movie for you! Fun fun fun fun ...
79358,The Season 4 has a tons of action and will keep you on the edge of your seat. You do tend to like the characters if you were following the previous seasons. Acting and presentation is top notch which keeps you glued to the series. Season 4 ends amicably well and I am happy to learn that USA network has renewed the series for more butt kicking action in season 5. Wonder where will Annie go? - can't wait.. Excellent series... Worthy of five stars!
79359,"bought 1 of these to run from my small solar/battery system - it really does not take many amps on 12v - less than 2a on setting 2?happy, so I bought another. we'll see about durability.moves a good bit of air."
79360,I would give a 3 star but spouse really enjoys it. Oedipus covered it better. The story line is weak IMHO and character development is shallow - shock value more important than characters it seemed to me. NOT FOR CHILDREN - nonono!
79361,"Despite its title, the Comedy Central produced ""Workaholics"" is not a traditional work place sitcom. It is a quintessential stoner/slacker comedy featuring three friends as they adapt (or refuse to adapt) to the increasingly complex world of adulthood. The guys are continuously rude, obnoxious and/or clueless and yet the bonds of their friendship may stretch, but never break--even when they behave in the most horrifying ways to one another. Unabashedly silly and crude, and oftentimes hilarious, this comedy makes no apologies for what it is. Not for sensitive viewers, this is in-your-face aggressive without a concern for political correctness or appropriateness. It is the irreverent ""anything can happen"" feel that is the core selling point for this ridiculously appealing show. I suspect that if you enjoy the wild antics of ""Workaholics,"" you will become a fervent and vocal supporter of the show. If, however, it all seems a bit juvenile for your taste--there is a good chance you will absolutely loathe this program. This could very well be a love-it or hate-it proposition.Season One lines up ten episodes which spend about equal time between work and other recreational activities. Some of the strongest episodes do deal specifically with the job site. In one episode, the boys vie for a promotion and their warfare against one another becomes increasingly brutal. In another, the boys organize a strike when the bosses won't recognize a completely ridiculous holiday. The season finale (with an invaluable assist by guest Chris Parnell as the company's CEO) has the guys fighting to save the company itself! It's all over-the-top and silly but that's the charm. In one of the show's most uncomfortable episodes, the boys befriend a child predator because he's a cool guy. Hey, you can't argue with that kind of reasoning!The show succeeds on the chemistry between its leads--Anders Holm, Blake Anderson, and Adam DeVine. While all fill their particular niche to perfection, it is Holm that is the stand-out for me. The only character that straddles the worlds of adolescence and adulthood--he is oftentimes made the stooge for trying to be successful. Jillian Bell provides great support as an off-beat co-worker that gets into her share of trouble as well, and Maribeth Monroe is delightful as the boss consistently pushed over the edge of reason. This is a deft comedy of slapstick and silliness. Its humor is crude and juvenile. If you don't like that sort of thing--then, by all means, stay far away. If, however, your looking for a good fix of rude and rollicking laughs--give it a shot. KGharris, 7/11."
79362,Love the smell of this product and the low spotting residue left on the car. Make sure to wash in shade
79363,"First, I must note this really is a veryu cheaply made item.  I verified that the batteries are a very very tight fit(what were they thinking) but they just make it in with close to zero tolerance.  I bought this at Camping World nearby where, at the time, it was about the same price as here (15.55). They have since lowered the price on amazon.  It was quiet and seemed rather stable and I just did a few hours testing.  All seemed well and contrary to other reports, the unit never got hot.  Is it possible that although the units are the same model number that the ones being sold at Camping World are not as defective as the ones being sold at Amazon?  I asked the long time woirker there who claimed they never had a return on this unit and the reviews at the Camping world website were consistently positive, unlike the reviews here at Amazon.  Makes you wonder what is up with all this?I as yet have no longer term experience with the unit and if I run into problems worth mentioning, I will update this review."
79364,"In the quaint coastal town of Cedar Cove, Washington, stands a statue of which identity no one knows anymore (see, there was this fire a long time ago and, plus, the plaque had fallen off). Quirky activities are staged in Cedar Cove such as the Annual Seagull Calling Contest. Like clockwork folks gather at the pier to eyeball an odd fisherman's latest catch (it never seems to be fish).And in the Cedar Cove Municipal Court, Judge Olivia Lockhart rules with no-nonsense toughness but also with the wisdom that comes with ingrained familiarity of her provincial community. The series follows her as she juggles her professional and personal lives. When she opts to take her time on ruling on an uncontested divorce, she ends up in the local paper. This bit of controversy threatens her bid for federal judgeship. Not that it matters. Even suckers like us know that this small-town judge isn't about to abandon her hometown bailiwick. Not with a new romance in the offing. Not with her daughter engaged to a sleazy real estate developer whom Judge Lockhart trusts as far as the actress playing her can thrown Gerard Depardieu (who co-starred in my third all-time favorite Andie MacDowell film). And, plus, there's the title of the show.(Since no one asked, I won't even mention that my top two all-time favorite Andie MacDowell films are GROUNDHOG DAY and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL; my fourth favorite is, yes, HUDSON HAWK.)It's Hallmark Channel's first stab at a television series, and never mind that it's more of a shallow cut. CEDAR COVE embodies plenty of Hallmark's signature traits. It's wholesome. It's warm. It's non-controversial, not hard-hitting, not penetrating stuff. Cedar Cove, the place, looks stunning, like an awesome place to live in. Now, me, I long for quirky television drama like PICKET FENCES and NORTHERN EXPOSURE, and, despite the above opening paragraph, the quirk is at pretty low ebb here. It's early, yeah, but the characters promise to be of stock variety, the plot beats these familiar soap opera tropes. Still, if you're into writer Debbie Macomber's storytelling and if you relish comfort food television - as I do occasionally - then CEDAR COVE may be for you.I've missed Andie MacDowell, missed her classy twang. She's one of them beauties who grows only more luminous as she ages. She fleshes out her divorced, single mom judge character in interesting ways. I look forward to seeing how savvy she is in the courtroom. Apparently, her nomination for federal judgeship hinged in large part to that, impressively, only one of her twenty or so court decisions that were appealed was overturned by the higher court. Honestly, MacDowell is probably the only actor on this show who compels me to devotedly tune in next week. Having said that, Dylan Neal lends a measure of depth and charm as ""Jack Griffith,"" ex-Philadelphian and nosy new editor-in-chief of the local news rag. I'm sorry to say that the rest of the cast aren't so memorable... yet. I'm hoping Bruce Boxleitner can change that when he surfaces soon. By the way, were there any viewers who didn't instantly single out Brennan Elliott (the land developer guy) as a potential heel? That guy's so good at telegraphing sleaze, even Rick Hoffman (from SUITS) is taking notes.3.5 out of 5 stars, subject to change depending on how further episodes go."
79365,"I love these in both sizes.  The small one fits saucers or bowls.  The larger one fits 9 inch paper plates.  So I got the for the travel trailer, liked them so much got 3 more for the house.  Installed under my kitchen cabinets.  Spray painted them, with Rustoleum for plastic.  They blend right in.  So convenient,kids of 8ish age can reach them, saves on washing dishes, and Amazon has some great buys on paper products when buy in bulk!  What more could you ask?I saw some comments on how easily they move and plates might fall...so I took a piece of tape, taped a small bit to itself for a handle, and taped it so it can't move til I want it to. Not because it did move, because others said it does.  Might not need that tape..."
79366,Love this show. It is based on a book. It is a very strange show but fun. No problems with the DVDs and came fast.
79367,"Loved the show, definitely my 2nd favorite after Bosch in this group of originals. Looking forward to more. Loved the characters."
79368,Can't say enough good about this unit. I did a LOT of research before buying one and have to say i'm very happy with this choice. It make a big difference on our back porch so long as you follow the directions. You want it mounted AWAY from where you're relaxing so it attracts the insects away from you. This thing zapps them non-stop. Sometimes we just sit on the back porch and laugh at zap after zap. :)
79369,This show was great and wish it was never cancelled although these TV networks just don't give shows a chance these days.
79370,I use this pole for my vacuum my two nets and my broom. It works great and I can reach my whole pool.
79371,"Potentially this is a great series, but after a few episodes I felt it wasn't getting anywhere. There seems to be a lack of intensity, with story lines that just drift off. I am sure it will all come together in the end, but I don't think I will stick around since I am not enjoying it enough to wait. However, the concept is fascinating and the acting is excellent."
79372,Being Human is an excellent show.  This season has been particulary enjoyable.  I love the comical conversations between Aiden and Sally.  It's well written and the actors are great.  The chemistry between these 4 actors is palpable.  Season 3 is the best season so far!
79373,Saw some episodes when it was on TV but missed the rest. Good build of characters. Great story line. Worth the watch.
79374,"I rarely play with one, as I prefer a thin pick and these are more along the lines of medium, but when I do pull one out of my pocket to play, it always gets attention."
79375,"Easy to adjust, this little tool , takes the arm and hand cramps out of highway driving. For mainly city driving, however, you need to turn it down a bit to avoid sudden acceleration upon bumping it. I love it and use it constantly. Works well with or without gloves and with heavy or light gloves."
79376,"I purchased to of these because I store two vehicles during the winter. Not much to say, I just plug them in and forget them. Keep my batteries fully charged."
79377,"This &#34;movie&#34; which is shot like a made-for-television movie from the 1960's, is slow moving, boring, and uneventful. I tried to watch it all the way through, and managed to do so --but only after six attempts over a two day period. I literally kept falling asleep.That being said, maybe this is a medical breakthrough in the making. Yes, it is clearly an effective and safe way to treat insomnia, but I believe it has an even better use.In terminal patients, one would hope they might pass calmly, even willingly. Showing this movie will help ANYONE facing death make the decision to let go. After 20-30 minutes of this, death would be a sweet and welcome blessing."
79378,"Zombie Strippers (2008) is a horror comedy that as you might guess from the title, involves a number of women working as strippers who are transformed into zombies.  Reality is pretty much off the table early, as besides taking a few shots at George W. Bush, featuring half naked women getting violent, spilling blood, and engaging in some outrageous acts, is the main point of the film.Sometime in the future, a private company working with the government has developed a Chemo-virus that re-animates the dead, and turns them into relentless fighting machines.  A soldier infected by this formula while on a mission, winds up at a strip club where he attacks a dancer named Kat (Jenna Jameson), turning Rhino gentlemen's club's star attraction into a zombie, who covered in blood, becomes an even more popular performer.Club owner Ian Essko (Robert Englund) sees his staff of strippers gradually being transformed into infected homicidal zombies who murder his clientele, however he isn't too concerned, since profits are way up.  The talent includes Gaia (Whitney Anderson), Lilith (Roxy Saint), and an innocent newbie named Jessy (Jennifer Holland), a Christian fresh off the farm, seeking to earn enough cash to pay for an operation for her grandmother.  When the zombified clientele gets loose, Essko arms his staff.  Eventually the army gets on the trail, and raids the establishment with chaotic results, as the violence reaches extreme levels, featuring outrageous gore, and some pretty radical special effects.Zombie Strippers features cartoonish violence, gory kills, lots of blood, crushed skulls, and half-naked zombies engaging in some radical dance numbers, in between infecting the club's mesmerized patrons.  The zombie makeup gets more extreme as Jenna Jameson and Whitney Anderson evolve into rival creatures who do battle on the dance stage.  Jameson's character even goes on the attack with vaginal launched projectiles.For zombie fans that are also Prime members, Dead Snow (2009), Brain Dead (2007), and Aaah! Zombies (2007) are among the current offerings that might be worth your time."
79379,There is nothing like watching this show at night with all of the lights out and in front of a fire in the fireplace.
79380,Keeps you on the edge of your seat. I can't stop watching. I also review past episodes to keep up.
79381,"I think I said it in my title, but I don't believe you will be disappointed in the shovel. Just realize if you don't really dig, you don't really need to pay for a shovel this nice. I picked this one up for $29 and couldn't be happier."
79382,"What to say about this except that they mounted properly, came with the right screws and I didnt have any issues. LOL"
79383,"I love this hummingbird feeder!I have quite a collection of feeders and am lucky enough to feed the birds all year long.So far this feeder seems like a winner!It is a nice size and holds a good 12 oz of nectar.It comes just like it is pictured with a sturdy, attached, metal hoop and extension for immediate hanging(love this).The clear part is glass and both the top and bottom unscrew from the glass for super easy cleaning.  It cleans up easily and actually sits flat on the counter so that you can easily fill it up with nectar.  You then attach the top and bottom again and hang outside.The feeder flowers are actually formed to be bee guards, so that they can't reach the nectar. Sweet!NOTES:*This is a copper finish!*There are two plastic pieces, one under the top lid, that the glass attaches to and also one under the copper finished, flower feeder part.  The bird resting wire is copper finished and attached to the bottom of the plastic piece.  It think it would be difficult to seal if it didn't have the plastic piece, but I am not sure.I have the bird seed feeder( Perky Pet Antique Copper Bird Feeder)that matches this hummingbird feeder and it has help up very well over the past year or so.  I hope the hummingbird feeder last as well!  They look great together."
79384,I have always lived the little bear books so I love this show.  It is very uplifting and I prefer it over some of theory trendy kids shows.  It is timeless.
79385,I use this on older Lycoming engines where they used clamps with a short rubber hose between the metal tubes for the intake. This is much easier to snake around exhaust etc to the clamp then regular pliers.
79386,"I positioned the fly trapper next to my double doors leading to the deck.  I am surprised how many insects it traps -- I didn't know so many were visiting.  I like it because, of course, it works but also there is no odor to deal with and changing glue boards is a snap.  The boards are cheap enough to keep it relatively clean all the time.  A good investment."
79387,"The plot for this movie is not a trite as some of the Hallmark movies for Christmas.  I like the storyline and, of course, Kevin Sorbo is great in anything (JMO)."
79388,"This lock is advertised and labeled as fitting class III and IV hitch receivers.  It is also recommended by Amazon to be purchased with the Allen 2 Bike Hitch Carrier.  Although this lock is solidly constructed, the 5/8"" diameter pin is too large to fit either the Allen 2 Bike Hitch Carrier or any class III hitch receiver that I've ever seen.  Amazon was gracious about allowing me to return it for a full refund.  I've replaced it with a lock with a smaller pin that actually does fit a class III hitch receiver.  This large, heavy lock was apparently designed for a class IV hitch receiver, not a class III."
79389,"It arrived in a small package with 3 main pieces in it (the base, the bottom fork and the top fork) and it didn't take much assembly to put it together.  It does a great job holding the guitar upright and makes it look a lot nicer as well.  I will probably buy a couple more of these.The only downside I can see so far is that the foam padding is rather thin.  I hope this doesn't eventually have a hole wear through it, but over time I could see it happening.  I suppose by that time I could find some replacement foam and fix it myself though."
79390,"Schumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge MaintainerWell worth the price...does exactly what it is suppose to do.(Update) After using this charger less than 5 mos. to maintain my R.V., which is seldom driven, I have found that, because of the charger failing to cycle back to the charge mode properly, the battery that it was hooked to was stone dead. Now, I'll do some research to find out the annoying process of returning the charger for warranty.(Update) I have contacted the manufacturer, Schumacher, concerning the failure of this charger but after 3 weeks, have received no response and it doesn't look like I am going to. So, I guess I'll just take the loss of making a bad choice and trash it. BTW, I am using two Chicago Electric on Board chargers, one on my Jeep and the other on my Mercury Sable. Both are giving very good service and are less expensive than the Schumacher or the Battery Tender."
79391,It's a good film for young teens.  if you're over the age of 16 it's cute but that is it.
79392,This movie was very very good. I cannot wait to buy the second and third seasons of Hell on Wheels now.
79393,"For those unfamiliar with the chemistry of gardening, there are always numerous factors to consider when maintaining your plants, so here is a breakdown of what's in the bag, what it means, and how it affects your pansies (and your soil, or other plants).10-7-7What does that mean?It means there is 10% Nitrogen, 7% Phosphorus, and 7% Potassium, which is an optimal specific ratio for pansies. Other plants might require different ratios to encourage the proportion of nourishment going to the green parts like leaves, or to flowers, or to root development, to name a few.These (10-7-7) properties are optimal for foliage, rooting, and the setting of flower buds. The organic ingredients strengthen the plant and improve overall soil health.Keep in mind, however, that fertilizers are only one factor in ensuring your pansies (or any other plant) grow beautifully, and that you need to understand your environment.In terms of soil, here are some questions to ask: What kind is it? What's the PH? What nutrients are present or lacking?Other factors include the weather and rainfall. Pansies are ideal for cooler climates, for example.This fertilizer is easy to use, optimal for pansies, and contains organic ingredients that will nourish the soil not just for a short time, but in the long run as well."
79394,"We've had to seriously clean our pool's filters this year due to ash and pollen in the water and we started off the season with some tough algae.It's taken a couple of weeks to get the (saltwater, gunite) pool in perfect health but the last thing we did was to add this enzyme.  I'm sure it was a cumulative effect but the algae is finally totally gone and the pool looks great."
79395,I think this was a really good film it seemed short but It was enjoyable. I think if you liked FROZEN or WOLFS or love films with some violence but not overdone with it... films done in the snow... you will love this.
79396,An intellegent show with first rate acting.  Makes you believe in the early days of NO and all the spirits in that world there.  You won't be able to stop watching it.
79397,Perfect fit on Airstream trailer. I use it when the standard footer is too long.  This shorter foot is ideal when parking on an incline and the hitch is too close to the ground.
79398,"If the thought of finding a live critter struggling to be free doesn't bother you then these glue traps will be good for you. I find that they work very well and not only catch critters, but also creepy crawlies. You will find spiders, centipedes, and other legged creatures in these traps. I've used them in areas where I have insects and no mice/rats just to catch the bugs. The only downside is that sometimes when you catch mice in these they live for quite a while, trying to escape. If you're using it in an area that you don't frequent (shed, garage) then that won't be a bother for you. We've had lots of luck with these glue traps over the years."
79399,"No spoilers, but if you expect to squeeze another end of the world type show into that already saturated market you'll need to give us some more meat in the first few episodes.  That five minute &#34;teaser&#34; scene at the end was all that made this stand out from the rest.  I don't want to see another &#34;Under the Dome&#34;-esque show where we wait an entire season for the meaning to be explained only to have a &#34;SURPRISE! IT'S NOT A MINISERIES AFTER ALL&#34; moment and have to wait X number of seasons to figure out what the heck we've been watching all this time."
79400,"I have less than ideal soil and I needed a better way of digging holes than one at a time with a hand spade.I came across something like this at a local garden supply store but it was only 8"" long and dirt got all over my power drill. No local garden supply carried anything longer so I bought the 24"" version from Amazon.I used a hand file to create a triangle on the end of the bit so that the auger wouldn't slip in the drill.  With my soil, I have to use a powerful electric drill.  In the areas where I've been using good soft soil, a battery powered drill worked fine.What would have taken all day using a hand spade took only minutes.  Great tool.  Wish I knew about it a few years ago."
79401,"A little miffed that season 5 was released in 2 parts, which took a lot more coin from my pocket, but this is definitely a top show.As with Shameless and few others, you can't stop watching, and lose track of time when you do. That's my yardstick."
79402,"This product worked great the very first night. I had dead snails laying all over the place. What I like best about this product, compared to others, is that there was no dust flying around. I don't like breathing in poison. This made me a happy camper."
79403,This plant stand is not only sturdy put it is pleasant to look at. I put it outside on our front porch and added one of my wife's potted plants and it looks wonderful. Don't have to worry about it tipping over.
79404,"I like the idea of this feeder. It's design is especially handy for people with limited storage; if you want to store away the feeder for a while, it collapses easily to a very small size.I found it easy enough to fill. The trouble was it didn't work with our current 20# bags of shelled sunflower seed. They spilled out of the little holes.  I had planned to buy some other seeds but don't have room to store them until we run out of the current supply, and Amazon wants the review now.  I will update when I try it with other seeds."
79405,"This is a super easy to use pedal. You just choose the speed of the chorus effect and the rest of the parameters are preset. Don't worry they sound great for that classic chorus sound. If you really want to be able to tweak everything, then get the MXR Analog chorus instead. It has about six knobs. I like the ease of use on this one, and I omly use chorus sparingly. Another cool feature of MXR pedals is the rubber knob cover that comes with it. It allows you to adjust the chorus rate with your foot."
79406,"Very strong acting, dialogue and directing. You feel like you are watching a first rate movie . I see this as a definite must see.. Tell your friends!"
79407,I use braided straps to hold them even more securelyin high winds. I expect them to last about 3 years before Ineed to replace them.
79408,"Looks like I still don't like sharks but there was a lot of interesting info about those denizens of the deep.  Although it appears that they also like the shallows, especially where surfers are"
79409,"I have bought this filter before. I highly recommend it to all bikers to buy when they need to replace their filters, it make the removal and install so much easier to work with due to the nut attached permanently to the bottom of filter. besides, its a higher performance over the oem filter. buy it you would love it too."
79410,"We have plenty of goldfinches visiting our thistle feeder (s), but we also had/have plenty of the house finches visiting too. Sometimes we had nothing but housefinches on the feeder. Mrs. Spudman wanted to look at goldfinches, so she bought this feeder to discourage the hoggish house finches and attract mosty, if not only, goldfinches.This is our second upside down thistle feeder, and we got the same results. The house finches ignored the upside down feeder, but so did the goldfinches. After two or three weeks, Mrs. Spudman finally gave up the effort and put the original thistle feeder back. Within a few days the goldfinches returned.Looking at the photos on this page, it is evident that goldfinches or at least some goldfinches like this style of feeder. We just didn't have good luck with it. I can't say that there is anything wrong with the style or materials of the feeder. Our Perky Pet Feeder model 399 with hibernate for the winter with the other upside down feeder. We'll probably give it another shot in the spring with hopefully better results."
79411,"I like this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" better than any other. It's true to the book, the cast is excellent and the locations are wonderful too. Colin Firth will always be Mr. Darcy for me."
79412,"Loved season 1 and found the second season entertaining. Season 3 seems to be off to a slow, melodramatic start, but staying with it for now."
79413,"I suspect this season might have been even more exciting and engaging than the first had the writers' strike not cut it short.  Since it doesn't have to introduce the characters, premise, or plot, the creative team could tell a straight-ahead story that never stops accelerating right up through its final moments.  But as the ""alternate ending"" demonstrates, they drew up short just as they hit a new creative flowering.Last season's survivors struggle to gather their lives and move forward--no small task when you've saved the world but can't take the credit.  Scattered from Japan to Ireland and from the present to the medieval past, they orbit each other, struggling to unknot the conspiracy that binds them together.  But when old secrets come back to the fore, the heroes must face a new enemy: their own collective guilt.If I had to find fault with this season, it's the needless introduction of new characters who complicate the narrative arc.  This season has so many characters that some of them disappear for two or three episodes, and we sometimes don't notice.  Like the X-Men comics of the 1990s, when Xavier's mansion housed a strange, expanding army, it becomes difficult for the audience to keep all the angles in mind.But for all that, it remains a tightly structured and propulsive story.  It makes good use of popular science fictional standards in a new and inventive way, and it plays interesting characters with complex needs off each other faster than the speed of light.  I wish they'd had the chance to explore the bold options they wrote for themselves, but it stands as a worthy successor to the first season."
79414,"For years I have fell more and more in love with my Yamaha CGX-111SC. Stil, nylon acoustic guitars have this weird sound when played on open spaces without using the piezo (note: change to a better piezo system, LR Baggs are great!), high notes were lost in the thin air covered by the lower notes. I wanted to experiment with this item... result: GREAT!!! I finally got to listen to what I use to heard from the recordings at controlled environments. The sound is richer and clarity makes unique."
79415,I love love love this show. I did not start watching it from the beginning but I caught one or two episodes on TV and really liked it so I watched season 1 on Amazon and I love every show. If every family were like this one America would be a really fun place to live in my opinion. Getting readsy to watch season 2 now. Hope it is as good as season 1.
79416,My favorite of the pilots that I've seen! Please make more! The cast is incredible and the characters are remarkable!
79417,wish i discovered these years ago.  comfortable and the grip works wonders.  nice clear tones with this pick tips.  thanks
79418,Amazing item made in the U.S.A. I have this hooked up and it does what it supposed to do. It waters my yard and I foresee many good years of usage as compared to the gun type sprayer that eventually breaks down and need replacement. This is why I bought this sprayer.The company even sent me an email on how to take care of this sprayer. This company cares about there products.
79419,"A guy gets back from 5 years stranded on an island, and he says to his sister, ""you were there the whole time?"" Don't wait until the 7th episode to figure out this is a dumb chick-flick. Crappy acting, cookie-cutter cliches and nonsensical plot."
79420,"This could be a really good show but it's too Hollywood with loud music, zip by photography and they drag everything out.  I stopped watching it after a few shows."
79421,"you can sure learn a lot watching this series, and it stays very interesting as well, a  must watch, enjoy ..."
79422,"Bottle came as described, have not had to use it, but it comes with the TPMS safe sealant in most flat kits."
79423,"this product works just as well as other conditioners I have used at higher and lower pricing, it was convenient to order and not have to go to the store and buy something for my leather boots"
79424,My first encounter with James Spader was in Stargate and loved him.  What a pretentious villon he is in Blacklist.  I look forward to next season very much.
79425,It's good but sometimes I think it's a little too imoral for me.  And personally I think they dragged out this show too long.  It could have been finished in 7 or 8 seasons.  They threw in a few stupid shows like &#34;Weedend at Barney's&#34; to drag it our longer.  Get to the point!!  Thank goodness it's the last season and Tedd finally gets to meet the mother.
79426,"Life is one of the freshest new shows on TV right now. I love the main character, I love Adam Arkin's character, I just cannot recommend this series highly enough.The zen take on everything really makes this an offbeat yet engaging cop series."
79427,A good detective/police stories of a very small Ireland country city. Good look at the Ireland cost-land and country side.
79428,"The only improvement would be to add some up-right spikes to let dishes lean against.  Otherwise, perfect RV size, and works well, while staying out of the way.  Oh, it would be nice if the base/cover actually snapped in place rather than just resting on top when stowed, then you could store things in it."
79429,"We've tried just about all the traps out there - and basically, after tracking performance for about a year, the top performer in our warehouse was an old fashionedVictor Mouse TraporVictor Rat Trap.However, we had a trap-shy rat get inside the house. I was afraid it might be pregnant looking to nest (it *was*) and wanted to catch it quick before any pups were born. I tried D-Con poison only to learn that it could take up to 10 days for it to work, and I couldn't wait.I set several types of traps, including this one (I paid $4.98 at Lowes) since the bait cup is large & you can put anything in it. The rat initially came upstairs to seek out some large chunk dog food, and since it was trap-shy, I thought it would be best to bait it with something familiar (the dog food is too big/heavy for a traditional trap).After 8 days of eluding us, this method worked within 4 hours (I give as much credit to the bait as to the trap). But it did NOT kill - the neck was stuck between the teeth of the trap. In an old fashioned Victor trap, it snaps on the neck, not the head, which is instant & humane.This was in the kitchen, I was not home, and my wife was severely traumatized. It was flopping around everywhere, bleeding and contaminating *everything* in the kitchen, peeing and pooping everywhere. It's rear claws scratched up the cabinet doors. My wife had to lock up our dog & cats, who were curious but were in harms way. Awful, awful, awful. This was hours of cleanup, and it was terribly inhumane.With a few tweaks, this could be a superb trap. But it did not do the job, and this was just awful folks. It doesn't matter if it's in your living space, or a basement, attic, warehouse, garage, etc ... do you really want to spread blood, potential disease/tick/lice/etc everywhere?Ok, so here's our apples-to-apples comparison. 9-month experiment, testing 7 different products. We eradicated all the rats (11 total), and the oldest, simplest, cheapest trap is the clear winner:*Victor Old Fashioned Rat Trap- 7 (caught 7 of 11)* Tomcat Rat Snap - 1 (caught 1 of 11, but did NOT kill it)* D-Con Baitbits - Killed 3, but the bodies all ended up in a wall or floor, causing a HUGE stink and a HUGE mess to dig out. In one instance we had to remove part of a floor - took hours and cost hundreds of dollars. Given time, all the rodents may have eaten the bait, but the poison takes 3-10 days to take effect so it's hard to say. Poison has other problems - it gets spread around, it can be eaten by pets, or, a pet or wild animal might eat the dead/poisoned rodent. If you're going to use poison bait, we strongly recommend also using traps.*Victor Multi-Kill Electronic Mouse Trap- Zero (O). Left out for continuously for 9 months (270 days)*Tomcat Block Bait- Zero (0)* D-Con Rat Glue Traps - Zero (0) - This is an awful idea, just makes a mes. Avoid this!*Tomcat Wood Rat Trap- Zero (0), but the rat steals the bait every time. They do not snap. I whacked the trap with a broom handle and it still won't snap. Makes you wonder if the rat designed this one!Final note: If you need help placing your traps or learning about best baits, go to the Victor web site. Good information, quick & concise. My two cents on bait: any nut butter (peanut butter, etc) works great, mix in a small piece of bacon for good measure. However, if your rat came into your home/garage/building because they found a food source (like dog food, grain, etc), use that to bait your trap. Good luck!"
79430,"I love this show and this show doesn't let you down at all. Mac is one of my favorite characters, but since he's fat in the episode, he doesn't seem as loud and seems sluggish and uninteresting in this season. But, I heard he loses the weight in the next season, so he'll be back to his normal, in your face self! Def not a deal breaker."
79431,This product works great as support for the camper's sewer hose and stores away very quickly and compact.  Very happy with the purchase.
79432,"definitely recommend these over any other string trees. I used both, one for DG and BE, required some minor drilling so I had a guitar tech do it for me just to be safe..."
79433,"I've always enjoyed White Collar, as silly as it is, because of its stylish take on NYC.  But in the last few episodes, it's lost some of the features that anchor at least my interest.  If anyone's paying attention, then:1. We don't need a psychobabble back story for Mozzie2. What happened to the women?  Elizabeth is sorely underused; Diana is barely present; Sara is nowhere to be seen.  These roles are all played by fine actresses who bring humor, class, and pizzazz to what is otherwise a Hardy Boys story.  Bring 'em back!  In fact, a few episodes where the boys are locked up somewhere and it's up to the girls to rescue them would help a lot.3. Is there a writers' strike on?  The actors look embarrassed delivering some of that dialogue."
79434,This is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and double-leather ends.  The color stands out well on the black background.  Available in various colors.
79435,"this is a great buy for what you get,the bulbs and ballasts,and they have lasted a good while to,for what you get they are a great buy"
79436,"I was a huge fan of Bones when it originally aired.  I've read the books this series is based upon, I work with ""squints"" and I thought the writing was spot on, especially the cultural conflict between the scientists and the ordinary joe, i.e., Booth. The original seasons creatively worked through those conflicts and demonstrated how a team can be formed from this kind of diversity.  However, this season has become a characture of that original season.  The characters who had grown are regressing.  Bones is becoming every negative quality that can occur with an over inflated ego and it is not pleasant to watch.  She's superior, hypercompetitive and she doesn't seem to realize that everyone has both strengths and weaknesses -- including her.  If the writing doesn't somehow curb this trend I won't want to be around her and I sure won't tune in to watch."
79437,"Sure, we have the creators of this show that came up with the concept and, to be sure, there are the characters that bring the show to life... but who really have the brains overall? Believe it or not, even though they're total brainiacs, it's not Sheldon or his totally egotistic roommate Sheldon (who has issues galore), I do believe it's their blonde neighbor, Penny, who definitely knows how to portray common sense effectively. And in each episode, where misadventures fire up all the time, I couldn't help but laugh my jaw off at each antic, especially the failed tactics of the live person counterpart of Pepy Lepew- Howard Horowitz. Almost felt like I needed a death certificate for laughing so hard each time.As for Sheldon's attitude and cold, distant, nonpersonal way... I laughed real hard at what happens to him at the Physics Bowl (who would've guessed a janitor could actually be smart?). Not to mention Rajesh finding a way to actually talk to women (make that two, though I don't think the side effects will be wanted), oh, and can't forget Leslie Winkler and her forward, somewhat off-putting, yet very well-done character as the female version of the guys. And the chemistry between Leonard and Penny may be obvious, but it also works, very, very well. It's not blaring, it works equally with all the nerdish humor- his intelligence and awkwardness with her charm and ditziness. And if this is just the start-up, then let the bigger laughs begin when I get to season 2."
79438,My husband & I both love watching this and can't wait for the next episode.  Actors are really good and storyline is great.
79439,"If you need some 6"" cables to connect your pedals, look no farther. These cables are perfect. They deliver good sound, are very small, and very cheap. What more could you ask for?!"
79440,They look great they should have came that way from the fac but thats how they keep the money coming but  screw it they look good!
79441,"I've always used gravel and/or plastic screen in the bottom of my pots (search ""bonsai screen"" at Amazon for a view of the screen I like). As another member mentions, it also makes the most sense to buy this stuff by the roll, rather than the ""disc"" - search Amazon for 3M's Garden Genius Durable Pot Filler Roll, 12-Inch x 52-Inch. That said, it's very useful stuff, and can be used repeatedly. Then again, so can gravel and plastic screens. This filler is better than the screen because it keeps more dirt from escaping; but, I'm not sure it's worth 6+ bucks PER DISC, i.e., per planter! The way I see it, these things should sell for 10 bucks for a dozen or so; in fact, they don't need to be so thick, and they should be sold in multi-packs. Come on, 3M, it's a great idea... let's see you run with it! For now, I'm going to keep doing this the old fashioned way, and wait for the price to come down."
79442,"I've loved Mindy Kaling since she was on The Office. I was excited to find The Mindy Project, and was hooked after episode 1. I'm hoping this show gets the attention it deserves and has many seasons!"
79443,"I always like to watch movies with Judy Dench. The part she played in this film, however, didn't seem to be something I thought did justice to her acting abilities. I didn't care for Cranford so I didn't watch much of it."
79444,"I heard about this from my son, he said he just laughs and laughs. I don't. I find the mom character the most amusing, especially when her son said he used to pretend she wasn't his mother, she said &#34;me too&#34;...much like the comedy Arrested Development (I believe she is the same actress). Other than that, I haven't so much as smiled."
79445,"I was interested in the Kuisiware Heat Resistant Gloves for Oven, Grill & Barbecue mainly for use with my gas grill. With temperatures in the single digits lately, I haven&#8217;t been inclined to go outside to grill. What I didn&#8217;t expect was how much I&#8217;d appreciate these gloves for use in my kitchen. I honestly didn&#8217;t believe these would be something I would use much inside, but since I received a pair for review, I decided to try them out with the oven and stove.The first time I used them was while making Chateaubriand. First, I seared it on all sides on the stovetop in my cast iron skillet. The gloves made it easy to handle the cast iron skillet without fear of being burned while also allowing me to handle utensils easily. My pot holders and oven mitts do fine when I want to handle something hot, but it is clumsy trying to handle a cooking utensil while wearing a fingerless oven mitt and using any utensil while holding a pot holder in the same hand is even worse. The Kuisiware gloves&#8217; individual fingers make it easy to hold the pan while stirring, flipping, or performing any other task without need to remove the gloves between each step.I also used them when I cooked asparagus this weekend. I normally seal the asparagus in heavy duty foil, tented a bit on top, and cook it in the oven. While the foil cools quickly, there is still a good bit of steam that escapes when you first open the foil after the asparagus cooks. This was much easier to do while wearing these gloves.I&#8217;ll be using these gloves for most hot kitchen tasks from now on and highly recommend them. The only thing that would make them better in my opinion is if they made them in prettier colors and designs to match my kitchen d&eacute;cor &#8211; or at least so they blend in better."
79446,"It was fun to watch anytime you can retro and remember the struggles of teen hood, its enjoyable. Nice teen movie, enjoy it."
79447,"Yes. It smells kinda funny. Yeah, if you leave it sitting long enough, you'll have these fatty looking clumps in the liquid. No, they don't disappear after shaking. And still, after all those years, that bottle of Lexol conditioner still worked great on my MDX's leather. Between the Lexol cleaner and this conditioner, the 10 year old car's leather already looked newer. It can't save the glazing the driver's seat acquired from use, but all the other seats did manage to look like that brand new leather look; slightly matte, firm, but supple.For the price, I think Lexol conditioner's great. Leatherique's conditioner is quite a bit more expensive."
79448,"It's an okay show.  The actors did a great job it's just that the story was a bit slow.  i watched the first season hoping it would get better but it didn't and i decided not to watch the second season.  the show is focused on the late 50s and I guess back then the Prime Minister's office had a huge influence on what was reported on the news and what wasn't.  To me I found this most fascinating and it made me wonder how much of it was true today, not only in England but in the States as well."
79449,I bought this sway control to help my Daughter's towing of her travel trailer.  It fit her trailer and ball mount perfectly and helped control the trailer way on windy days.
79450,"As historical fiction and as adventure drama, the show is terrific. The acting and the production values are both superior to the writing, however, which is too bad. For others who have seen the show, how do you suppose the vikings knew when it was noon at sea?  :)"
79451,Love everyone and am sad that Nina cant love both brothersIt is alsmost impossible to chooseI would choose Stefin
79452,"Last season it was the golfer guy's story seemingly out of nowhere shoved into the show and dominating too much of the end of the season. His dominant trait was that he was silly. This one is even worse. The cop and his daughter are not only not interesting at all but the character of the daughter is something of a monster. I don't think there is a worse character in existence than some miserable pubescent teenager lashing out at everyone around them and with zero control of themselves. From Boris to her? It reminds me of the couple of episodes I saw of ""A Gifted Man"". No where near the intensity but I can't bear to watch an intelligent, highly skilled, and extremely generous person who saves people's lives be consistently treated like garbage by people.I still like the scenery, Divya, and Paige and some of the cases but the miserable people are given too much attention. Out of all the characters you could come up with to live in the Hamptons? This guy and his daughter? I'm so confused."
79453,"The last season, wrapped everything up nicely.  Stayed true to the start and had a good end.  It was great that they did not try to just go on and on and on.  Make a good show, have a beginning and an end."
79454,"Fun, educational, entertaining!  My 3 year old grandson LOVES Blue's Room - even requests to see this show over and over!"
79455,"Followed all the instruction on filling and charging. I'm not new to motorcycle batteries. This battery has already failed in taking a full charge. Not even a year old. At first I thought it was my bike that wasn't charging.....Nope, turns out this battery crapped out. I threw in a 7 year old Drag Specialties battery I had and use this Yuasa as an expensive paperweight."
79456,"These aren't 5000k, more like 4000k. The color will shift from yellow to white/blue, but it takes a very long time. These are great. DON'T BUY CHEAP BULBS! I bought some off eBay, about 30$ a pair, and they stopped working within a week. They also smelled terrible too, the plastic was burning off because the bulbs were so hot. I wish these were 5000k, as described! I guess some other dealer wrote that.Save your time and money and buy these!"
79457,"I don't understand how people find shows like this entertaining. If you enjoy Wes Anderson movies you may like this. It definitely has that vibe, I personally don't care for his films myself. Good cast but I do not relate to any of the characters."
79458,"Parade's End is simply one of the best ever historical series/films.  It covers a most important period and era.  WW I and England's decline in power.  It is also a love story and a glimpse of a world, a class, an epoch.  I've seen it twice and will probably in the future see it again.  Acting, script, direction and production faultless.  If you like period drama see it."
79459,"Nice solid cables, with excellent support at the ends.  Should last a lifetime of usage no problem and just what I needed to connect my tube preamp."
79460,"Most better quality leather guitar straps are typically $20 or more, so in retrospect, the low cost of this Planet Waves Black Leather guitar strap should have served as a red flag.  I bought it anyway, hoping that it would be a decent product, but unfortunately, upon receiving it, I was almost immediately disappointed at the quality of the item.While the strap appears to be 100% leather, and isn't a piece of junk, it doesn't appear to be of very high quality. The leather is thin and soft, and I would not be at all surprised, if the edges soon begin to curl, and the strap begins to wrinkle. I don't expect the leather around the holes for the strap nuts, to hold up well long term. If you use this strap, you probably want to use some kind of strap locking system.I have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years. The leather is thicker and stiffer, and has resisted fraying along the edges. While the leather has developed some cracks, it is still holding up fine, and there is no chance that the strap will tear. I could be wrong, but looking at the Planet Waves strap, I have doubts that it will hold up anywhere near as well or as long.If you are a casual player, this strap is probably fine, although strap locks are recommended. The leather may start to curl up and deform, but the strap certainly isn't going to fail immediately. While serviceable, more serious players, or those with an aggressive style of playing, might want to spending a little more for a better quality leather strap. I decided to keep this strap, but it is installed on a secondary guitar that I don't play that much."
79461,"This is a well-designed solution to trap and relocate small disruptive animal pests, though it is not exactly perfect.Setting the trap could not be simpler. To achieve the recommended one-door set method, simply lift the second door cable over the anchor hook on top of the trap, so that when the handle switches over, the cable does not lift the second door. The cables are to length that either one or both doors lift high.The only problem I have with the trap is with its easy set handle. It tends to be a hair trigger of a lever, which can go off on a whim. I can shift the handles to one side and it seems to stay put, but because it can react so easily, I advise that after setting the trap, to tap on the cage a couple of times; if the trap does not trigger, it is ready for business. Other than this minor issue, the trap works well.A metal plate in the middle of the trap causes the doors to close when disturbed. A plastic piece fixed to the outside of the doors, keep them closed if an animal pushes from the inside. A small gap is possible when the doors lift slightly; however, these gaps are about as big as the space between bars on the cage, so anything that could squeeze through the gap is likely able to squeeze through the bars of the cage as well. A mouse can come or go as it pleases, but a large rat can be contained.This safe, lightweight and humane trap is simple to activate. It is about as easy to set off as well, but once set with the handle firmly in place, it is an effective solution to control burdensome yard critters. The instructions list a variety of easily accessible items to use as baits for chipmunks, rats, squirrels, rabbits, opossums, porcupines, woodchucks, minks, ferrets, armadillos, bobcats, raccoon and more."
79462,"This show is simply a copy of the &#34;Chopped&#34; series format. It does not have the judge panel, kitchen set-up or drama intensity that is a hallmark of Chopped. It was hard for me, as a Chopped fan, to give even on star to Chef Wanted."
79463,"This is a great product like I have always found from Miracle-Gro.  I have added this to my flowering container plants and they are really looking good this year.  It is easy to apply and doesn't really take a lot, I plan to apply it once every 3 months.  No complaints and it is the quality I expected!"
79464,Camco seems to make a good middle range product that does the job.  No need to spend more to get the job done.
79465,"I'm measuring 250mA at 13.4V or about 3.35 watts of power consumed.  They seem to be about 6000K in color temp.  They get warm but not hot, but I have only run for a few minutes at a time.  I ordered from ""Super Fast"" and didn't notice that it shipped from China.  They beat the delivery estimate but it did take 18 days from the order to the delivery. The adapters are handy."
79466,"May 28, 2014 update:  We have this chair positioned so that it only gets morning sun; there has been no fading, and so far Matt the cat has not deemed it necessary to use it for a scratching post.We needed to replace a 15-year old La Fuma zero gravity chair that Matt the cat has been sleeping in on the patio for the past 11 years.  This is because the La Fuma chair was a gift, and I never found it particularly comfortable.  On the other hand, this Caravan chair is very comfortable for me at 5'3"" (okay, sure, my legs do not reach the floor, but my back is comfortable) as well as my husband at 6'1"".  It adjusts effortlessly.  The fabric appears to be very sturdy, and the beige color, in person actually has a slightly greenish cast, which is okay with me because my other new patio chairs have light green and beige stripes.Here is additional information on the chair tag that is not presented on the Amazon product page site:  comfortable ergonomical armrests; anti-slip pads for security; finger tip locking system; and weight capacity of 300 pounds.  At $49 including super saver shipping, in my opinion this is a good value.  This review will be updated periodically according to how it wears."
79467,"Who knows what lies on the other side of life?  Not that this series will answer any questions about that, but it's interesting to watch what these other folks have experienced.  Is it all true? I don't know.  I watch TV for entertainment purposes...don't you?"
79468,"I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time, finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time, we cooked a lot of meat, pepper, corn and etc, it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it, it's gonna get a lot more use this summer."
79469,Made my own portable battery backup for camping and when the power goes out by hooking up 4 UPC type 12v batteries to this inverter all built in an extra large 50cal ammo box.
79470,Keeps me wondering if she will get through it without breaking the bank.I haven't watched enough to give a very good review. Sorry!Joan M.
79471,i alway love the show and it just a great story line and it alway something new and never got bored with this show!
79472,"i tried it on a superficial scratch, and kept rubbing the product several times, and reapplied 3 time and scratch is stil there, i tried it with foam pad, microfiber pad, microfiber towel, worst product meguairs produce."
79473,"My first uke so I cannot compare, but it sounds great. I don't know what stock strings it came loaded with but they sounded just fine!"
79474,"Season after Season I am never disappointed.  Even though this is for season 2, trust me it will leave you wanting more.  Love this show."
79475,"Show is a good psychological thriller.  There is an over abundance of gore.  The three leads have big shoes to fill and they do come close but both actors who played Lector prevously, in &#34;Lambs&#34; and the original&#34;Manhunter&#34; did a better job balancing the charm with the evil."
79476,"I bought this because the other lights that put out similar Lumens don't last as long.Also it was bought to replace the HID that I was very disappointed in because of a 2 bulb system that distorts, and has holes in the light pattern.This light does a great job and I will see if it last as long as the company says."
79477,This is the second 4 foot hydrofarm grow light ive purchased.  I bought one last year and then again one this year. (The first one still works great)  I use the grow light for my seed starter kits and noticed that the seedlings directly under the light grow alot stronger and healthier than the ones on the outside edges.  So thats where the 2nd light purchase came in.Having the lights hang from the adjustable strings is a pretty nice feature.  As the plants grow you can raise the light up by the pull of a string.The only thing i would change about this light that would make it better would be if it had 2 bulbs so it covers more area.
79478,I own this California Car Duster and it works really well.  It's true what they say about the dirtier it gets the better it cleans.  I have owned a couple of these and they last for years.  It works well to remove dust and light dirt.  The duster contains wax and really shines and protects your car.  It includes a nice storage bag to keep it clean for storage.
79479,"Been using this for a generator and lawn mower.  Not long, though.  I can't say it prolongs the life of equipments, but they are running fine."
79480,I really like Bones and the characters that are brought up in each episode. The main characters are fun to watch
79481,"First, the description is slightly misleading. It reads:""Holds over 5 pounds of Black Oil Sunflower Seeds,  the most popular seed for wild birds""That last part gave me the impression that it would allow for other types of seed. If by other type of seed you mean plural in the sense of 2, then this is spot on. Very clearly on the package it tells you to only use Black Oil Sunflower seed, or a mix of Black Oil with Safflower. That's about the variety you can fit in here without issue. I think smaller than Black Oil would work fine, but with the holes in the bottom (I guess it is there for drainage if it rains?), smaller seed will definitely fall right through, meaning birds will be eating off of the ground.In terms of setup, get a nice heavy duty to put this on. 5 lbs of sunflower seed will bend poles designed for smaller feeders (I know as I tried it for a test).Once it was setup, I was getting a lot of birds feeding at a time, from cardinals to chickadee sized birds.If you don't like Blue Jays and birds of that size, you will likely be happy with this feeder. The perches on the feeder are on the smaller range, meaning larger birds are unlikely to want to perch on them for long, if at all. Larger black birds have come and gone on this feeder, unlike the other feeder that they stand in and toss seeds to their minions.Recommended."
79482,very interesting but the plot gets lost every once in a while
79483,"This cutting board Measures 7-7/8&#34; x 11-13/16&#34; x 1/2&#34; it fits perfectly on my counter right next to my stove, which makes it easy for me to just chop and drop right into the pot that I am cooking in. It's small enough to move around the kitchen if you need to use it at the kitchen table. It's also very easy to clean. It's very sturdy, but not real heavy, so I really like it. When I'm not using it, I just hang it on the wall in the kitchen, so it's easy to just grab. This is a very good quality cutting board."
79484,"The winter birds that frequent our neighborhood must be awfully hungry, so I decided that I would buy a couple of these to help them keep fed and warm.  I use Black-striped sunflower seeds (thinner shells than regular sunflower seeds).  This particular bird feeder seems quite sturdy, easy to put together and to fill with seeds.  I would say that probably 10-12 birds can fit comfortably on the outer rim to feed on the seeds.  The seeds are released to an area below the chamber that holds the seeds, providing easy access to the seeds.  This bird feeder has a classy look to it and our covered, open-air patio seems  I would definitely recommend this bird feeder to my friends"
79485,"This wax is just okay. It has easy application and removal. The overall result is good; however, I would prefer a good Carnauba wax. A good wax from Meguiar's or Mothers is much less expensive and will last much longer than this product. I agree with many other people that a car wash or two and you need to reapply. Disappointing."
79486,Watched this pilot and thought it was pretty decent. I'd watch if it got made into a series as long as it was part of Prime and not $1.99 per episode.
79487,It was constantly buffering and took forever to load.  So disappointing.  You have a lot of good HBO shows available now but there are so many issues with the buffering.
79488,Easy to use with my droid Razr and the free torque app.  Use this in my 03 grand cherokee.  I am batman.
79489,Good pilot. I like the realism and the complexity of the characters. It kind of reminds me of &#34;The Killing&#34;. I could see watching this.
79490,"My new electric guitar isn't particularly comfortable to play while sitting, so I needed a strap.  I've played with straps in the past and always found them to be uncomfortable, so I hoped to find a padded strap that didn't break the bank.  This strap fits the bill just fine.  Depending on the angle that your pegs are set, however, you may find that the holes in the strap will with time enlarge to the point that the guitar is always in danger of falling.  If your pegs are set at an angle, like on a Strat, this strap will last forever.  If you're on a guitar with a horizontal peg, like a LP, you'll probably want to invest in some strap locks as well.  This will move the pressure from the strap holes to the metal locks and both extend the lifetime of the strap and its security.  The padding is OK, but not great - however, it's certainly better than a regular nylon strap and does a good job of forcing the strap to lay flat across the shoulder which is a huge bonus."
79491,"When I first heard of this show I was hoping for something like &#34;Zero Cool&#34;, Jonny Miller's character in Hackers and &#34;O-Ren Ishii&#34;, Lucy Liu Ai Maeda's character in Kill Bill solving crimes.  It's not that but it is a lot of fun. (Spoiler)  Both of them are playing people who don't know how to fight even though the actors totally do. it is an interesting take on Holmes and Watson.  I do think that Lucy Liu's character needs a stronger role though.  I have a hard time believing she is anyone's sidekick."
79492,Sure beats the price of a similar quality air filter from the auto parts store.  Well manufactured and a good quality product.
79493,"Before getting these I had seen others using them, but not appreciating how well they work to keep things moving in the sewer hose.  Now we use this even with the Smart Tank.  They are well designed and hardy to stand up well even when stretched out over a pretty good distance.  Yes they can be secured to the ground if need be."
79494,"UI ahve a senstive nose an asthma, and most insect killers throw me into coughing fits or wheezing spasms. This does not. It says odorless and it really does not have hardly any smell a all, and so far it is working great.RoachI sprayed under the table of our pet parakeet to keep down any roaches, and I found 1 dead under the table. The next morning. So far no more.AntWhen We have hard or continual rain, we get ant infestations. Since we sprayed around the house, 1 week of constant downpour and the 1 week of rain at least once everyday, and low and behold no ants have come inside."
79495,My husband watches this he bought the last series and will watch in January when it comes on TV he loved it.
79496,"This makes sliding on the bass real smooth. It's also nice for cleaning. It is hard to tell if you are running low on oil or whatever liquid is in this thing but they seem to last for a fairly long time. And it's super easy to apply. Even though you're not a pro, act like one and slap some of this stuff on your bass or guitar before you play."
79497,"First of all, this was shipped in its original sales box all taped up, and that is it.  Was shocked to see the poor excuse of shipping method, but I guess you really cannot break this thing simply by shipping it.Installed on a 7K lb travel trailer, works pretty good, but did not elliminate all the sway.  Part of it is because I am towing with a large SUV that is really a little small framed for towing this size camper, even though the RV Dealers will say it is a perfect fit as does the tow vehicle manujfacturer.Sold the SUV and bought a big boy truck to tow with, and what a difference.  I don't even need this anymore, as the bigger tow vehicle makes all the difference.BTW, DO NOT back up with this connected to the tow vehicle and trailer, you will bend it faster that you installed it."
79498,A friend of my has one and I just found in love with it. Great sound! Beautiful color! The Applause exceeds my expectation whether it is unplugged or amplified.
79499,"I recently had a large Bradford pear tree fall during a bad thunderstorm, and from its size and bushiness, I knew I would need a chainsaw to cut it all up small enough to haul to the curb. In addition, I also had a sick oak tree that needed to go to the curb with it. Although I am not particularly scared of chainsaws, I didn't like the idea of tangling with a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" type of gas saw. I felt I could get more safety and ease of use, and almost as much power (but certainly enough power to meet my needs) with an electric chainsaw. This Poulan seemed to have everything I was looking for, especially with the power category checking in with 4 HP, so I had it overnighted with some oil and had at those trees over the weekend. I was pleasantly surprised at the impressive cutting power of this saw. As soon as I put it to a branch, chips were flying and wood was falling. It helped make quick work of both trees. I actually took the time to read the manual beforehand to be sure I understood the safety mechanisms, including the highly effective automatic chain brake, and I had no trouble operating the saw. When the chain finally slackened and fell off the bar (after almost two hours of fresh-out-of-the-box cutting), I thought I would be able to get it back on in short order. In this area, however, the manual is a little lacking, and it was only when I put the manual aside and used my brain power that I was able to reattach the bar and chain to the saw and make use of the adjusting mechanism to tighten the chain. This saw does use a lot of oil, which is good for the life of the saw, but it makes clean up a bit of a chore with all those oil soaked wood chips in the main housing. Still, once you know how to take apart and put everything back together, the saw is not that difficult to clean up. As for overall ease of use, I honestly don't think there could be anything better. I've used electric chainsaws before, and none were as simple and strong as this one. So, even though this saw is not exactly perfect, I consider its drawbacks to be small enough that they do not warrant subtracting a star from its rating. Finally, one word of caution: You will need the recommended safety gear and it will protect you during use. Don't assume because you're dealing with ""only"" an electric saw that a T-shirt, shorts and a ball cap will be enough protection. This is a seriously powerful tool and you should definitely suit up properly. Make sure you include safety goggles and steel toed boots. When the chips start flying and that first log drops faster than you thought it could, you'll be glad you did."
79500,"The setup sounds quite bland, but they explore the ethics of war and experimentation quite well in this episode. It never quite reaches that true western feel, but it is a solid episode nonetheless."
79501,"not bad, if you dont use any batteryand use a 9vdc adapter thingie...make sure thingie outputs at least500 mA if you can ...tried mic, bass, and electric guitar and keyboardsthru this thing...all workand the distortion control... mostlly notnecessary for me, but others will find thatcontrol  is use ful too...it is a cutie and works for fun,and u might get loudness around 90 dBA onsome frequencies...  not bad at all...even got a headphone connect on it forlate nite playing...a good thing. for the price it is worth..."
79502,"I'm a big Harry Bosch fan and I really liked this. The story and characters are very faithful to the book. I have to admit that I did find it a little slow. Somehow, without the inner commentary, a little is lost when the book is translated to video.Still, it was very done, and I would watch the series, if they make one."
79503,"I bought Meguiars Ultimate Compound because I had neglected my paint job for too long. I had swirls, oxidation and it made my black paint job look dull. After using this, those deformities were gone (or at least very well hidden.) I love this product, and have recommended it to everyone I know. It goes on easy and wipes off easy as well. There was no real wait time, but I would suggest following the directions cause it will be harder to remove if you let it set long on the paint. Other than that, this is a very good product."
79504,No complaints about this movie.  I would recommend this movie to others. It was not boring kind of slow and easy going.
79505,"Every character adds to the comedy.  It is a clean family show.  There is no profanity, no sex scenes.  A great  TV show overall."
79506,"Eddy & Pats are my idea of the perfect pair. They remind me that no matter how corrupt and decadent you are, you can still be hilarious"
79507,Still have 16 inches of snow on ground so haven't had opportunity to use yet. Awaiting warm weather to wash my 38 foot motorhome. Sure this will be awesome at keeping dirt and grit from bottom of bucket getting onto my wash pad and scratching my motorhome finish.
79508,"I am a novice gardener. I've grown tomato plants from seedlings but not much else. I get way too distracted to give them the daily devotion for watering and care. We also live in the woods and the deer munch on our yard daily. So I decided to try in 'indoor' garden. This is a great way to start a garden, even when the start of the growing season is slightly off.There are 18 seed pods, some are repeats, with a wide variety of seeds. They are really easy to plant after preparing soil. Just remove the top and push the pot in. They require daily (gentle) watering and it is recommended to remove all but one 2"" seedling from each pod growth. The kit comes with some basic directions and a small portion of Shake 'n Feed plus Calcium fertilizer.Seeds will take from 40-75 days before they can be harvested, depending on the vegetable (and how well you take care of them!).My daughter was really excited to start working with this. I see it as a great way to encourage a child or gardening newbie to try their hand, especially since it is so easy to start."
79509,Don't really like the underlying tones of drug references and bullying. Not exactly how I think the pilot episode should be made. Seems in the opening since there is a kid selling candy to other kids and a bigger kid comes and tells him that her needs to get off his turf. Then pours milk in his bag of candy. Then they proceed to show the bully making bath tub candy. I don't think this was well thought out. And I immediately turned it off for these reasons. You will be amazed what kids pick up on. (Typed but not read)
79510,"This is the third brand of this type of wiper (frameless) that I have used and these ones also perform better on my car than the standard framed type of wiper.  Usually at highway speeds, standard framed wipers (or worse yet -jacketed winter wipers) start to lift a bit or do not maintain full contact with my windshield, but these low profile wipers keep full contact along the full length for a clear windshield.  There was no squeak or stutter, and they were able to keep up with a full-on heavy rain, which some wipers do not seem to be able to do.  The drivers side wiper on my car covers more than 50% of the wipered area and the windshield is at relatively low angle which causes many wipers to lift or lose contact at highway speeds. This wiper works as good or better than any standard type wiper I have used.  Installation was a snap. I do not live in an area with snow or ice, so I cannot on this wiper in ""winter"" conditions. I would rate the performance comparable to the ACDelco Clear Vision. Only time will tell if it lasts as long as the Bosch Icon wiper that I still have on the passenger side after more than a year (the driver's side Icon wiper lasted about a year).  The Icons are the best I've ever used, but they are almost double the price.  Regardless of brand, I will not be going back to the old standard type of wiper."
79511,"This seemed to work OK, but it didn't protect my garden.  Guess there are other creatures of the night interested in my water melons, beans and tomatoes.The thing that I don't understand is why you would attract the deer with some sort of good smelling stuff to the deer, and then shock them to get them to stay away.  Now it the smell was water mellon or bean=based, I might understand the logic."
79512,This item does the job. I don't have any real marks against it but I've seen better stands out there.
79513,"The creators of this show really struck gold with a winning formula. It's a fine, strong ensemble cast. Hutton is very effective in the lead as the somewhat flawed, highly eccentric ""mastermind."" Aldis Hodge as Alec is always edgy and frequently hilarious. Beth Riesgraf as Parker brings equal amounts of sheer gorgeousness and sheer CRAZY to the role, but she is never ""over the top."" Put everyone together and you get a sense of balance where each cast member nicely complements and contrasts with the others, a true rarity in shows of this mind.The basic concept is also stronger than many of the ""expanded basic cable"" shows. Case in point, the Rob Morrow / Judd Hirsch vehicle ""Numbers,"" in which every single episode offers up an unsolvable, baffling crime which can only be solved when Morrow's idiot savant brother steps in and wraps everything up in a tidy little bow by concocting a mathematical formula. Movie of the week, amusing. Weekly TV show, tedious and predictable.The labels are accurate...""Robin Hood Meets Mission Impossible""...and yet, episode after episode the creators manage to come up with an entertaining premise and the cast pulls off with charm to spare.Read Amazon's description, read the reviews....if any of it sounds the least bit appealing to you, take a chance and order this set. You won;t be disappointed."
79514,Really good series it's like a cartoon version of the movie but deeper the animation is also done well with good scripts and voices it give you a closer look on how green lantern is and the enemies he comes in contact with.
79515,"It's a great string winder, and it is so nice being able to wind and cut the string with the same tool. It's a brilliant idea haha. It's very good quality, like all planet waves products."
79516,My coworker recommended this brand and I'm glad I got them. They work great and are definitely work not paying outlandish dealer and shop prices for replacement.
79517,"This is intended to replace a MIM 6 screw Stratocaster bridge.  It only comes with the bridge, no body screws, no back springs, no arm... nothing.  That's why it's so inexpensive.  What you see in the picture is what you get.But that being said, it a great value if you want to spruce up your MIM Strat.  The block is HUGE compared to a standard MIM bridge.  It was incredibly easy to install.  And the sustain is improved.One tip which I forgot, do not tighten the 6 screws into the body all the way. The bridge has to be loose enough for the bridge to move like a hinge.  The springs in the back keep it back.  The string tension keeps it balanced in the front.  What I did was tighten the body screws all the way, and then loosened them one 1/4 turn back."
79518,"Covers that nasty hole at the end of the receiver and provides a place to stash your wiring plug. Very neat and handy,"
79519,"After the Great War, out of work Captain, Tommy Beresford (James Warwick) accidentally comes across his lifelong friend and pal Prudence ""Tuppence"" Cowley (Francesca Annis). Tuppence is also out of work. Over their sparse meal they speculate on doing any job of anybody for outrageous fees.This speculative talk was overheard and the wheels are set in motion when Tuppence is given the opportunity and gives what she thinks is a false name. This sets off a series of events that employs them to find a missing girl and the identity of a mysterious Mr. Brown.Made for TV and fairly transparent, this film still has all the ambiance of a BBC Agatha Christy production.  It is a period piece and employs many major English actors. One actor you can recognize right off is Honor Blackman who played Pussy_Galore in ""Goldfinger"" (1964)."
79520,"What can I say, this machine is fantastic.  With a 100% duty cycle and check all my tires and fill as needed and not have to wait for it to cool down.  I went and added 5 to 8 lbs to all 4 tires on one car and 2 more on the other.  The motor never even got warm.  The cary bag is great and has lots of room for other small items.  The aire nozle locks onto the valve stem and the gage is failry accurate.  Everything is heavy duty construction.  Should have bought one years ago.  Now it is not as fast as the air pump at the gas stationor the big compresor in my gerage but for a small hand held unit it is fast enogh.  Besides, when I am out in the boonies what is a few minutes to air up over no air at all."
79521,"I've had to use this twice this year.  I hit a log two different times this year, breaking off the front tracking fin on our '01 Malibu each time.This stuff is easy to use and dries rock hard.  It sands well but is a good idea to get it as flat as possible before sanding.  Due to the location and most of the repair being covered by the tracking fin, I haven't taken the effort to polishing this up to a shine like I've read you can do.  I have read that you should avoid using this if you intend to gel coat over top of it, as gel doesn't stick well to it.Great product that I'm sure I'll be stuck using again next year."
79522,"I got this for less than half price under the ""used"" condition. The only thing wrong was the packaging was damaged. Big deal. This thing looks new for less than half the price of retail. Very heavy and feels/looks to be well built. I'll find out how good it is when I have to use it."
79523,"I keep my gas grill on the patio in the backyard, and the lighting isn&#8217;t great out there. The Kuisiware Barbecue Grill Light with 10 Super Bright LED Lights has come in very handy when I grill at dusk or after dark. It positions very nicely on the handle of the grill so that it illuminates the grill area when the lid is up. The power button is easy to activate with a slight swipe of the finger and the LEDs really are bright.The light attaches easily to the handle of my grill, and the head swivels so that you can shine it directly on whatever area of the grill you need. This light can also be removed from the grill easily.It takes three AA batteries, which are included in the package.I received this unit free to review, but plan to buy one for some friends who frequently grill. I highly recommend this grill light."
79524,"Two beautiful, talented actresses, Naomi Watts and Robin Wright are wasted in this terrible story.  It's not only a creepy premise---that they each fall in love with the others' son, but it's totally unrealistic.  If you turn the sound off and just look at the beautiful bodies and the beach scenes, you might enjoy it.."
79525,"I used this rake to rake leaves and dead grass out of my yard. The great thing about this rake is it is VERY light weight and has a long handle to make raking easier. The rake also has a large rake head making it easier to get more done, and makes picking up the piles easy as well. I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a rake!"
79526,"Repeat Order. This is nothing more to say.  I bought this the first time based on others recommendations, was pleased, and now have re-ordered.  That about says it all."
79527,"If you like police action series, this is the one for you.  I watched all the season's in a week.  Really good!!"
79528,"It took the whole season to come together for just the last episode, our characters are begining to accept what the world has made them become and I think we are supposed to be reviewing for ourselves,"
79529,"I bought this unit because my amp doesn't have reverb. But I discovered that this little pedal can give you greats sounds. Even when I use a reverbed amp, I turn it off and use my Hall of Fame."
79530,I am very disappointed that they ended the show before they finished the story line. If I had known they were not going to finish it I would not have bought these episodes. But it was a good show.
79531,"I bought this tool because of the reviews. The reviews were so correct. This tool is a great investment. You will be inspired to clean up neglected shrubs etc. on your property. If the branch fits into the opening, you can get a good clean cut. You have to get used to the cutting angle, but after a short time, you become a pro. Great tool!"
79532,This documentary is very helpful and enlightened me on why there are strange things that our ancestors saw and was enterpreted as well.
79533,"This comes in a very BIG box with lots of packing paper.  There is a clamp with two screws that you first attach to the pole, the black skirt goes over and simply sits on clamp (the clamp does NOT attach to the skirt), and you push the edges together until they interlock. I was surprised that it moves or can rock a bit, so if a squirrel somehow tries to climb up on the thing from another structure it tilts even more making it tougher. The idea is, they are stopped from climbing up the 'pole' and it does that easily.  If they figure another way to jump on your feeder you can't blame this.  It's not magic, it's a pole block to the critters.There is a big paper label but I carefully pulled it off without tearing it. A little heat (hair dryer?) might make it easier.I did spray the top of the skirt with silicone spray, it may not be needed and a car wax might be worth trying later.One thing I noticed since installing it, I have more birds at the feeder!  I think perhaps it blocks the view to the ground and makes them feel safer (just guessing).  So far no bird has even tried to land on it.I'm a new 'birder' and I'm starting to wonder if there is no end.  I started by tossing seeds on the patio... LOL"
79534,Bought these to replace some plain reflector fastners on my Harley. Ended up being a nice custom touch that looks a lot better than the previous fastners. Acceptable quality. I would buy them again.
79535,love it waiting for more
79536,"This is one of the best science fiction mini-series ever, and it is far better than the 80s original.  What if advanced aliens openly arrived on Earth, professing friendship but with ulterior motives?  This series examines this premise plausibly and with zip.  The pilot grips the viewer immediately, and by the end of it I was hooked.  Elizabeth Mitchell as Erica Evans is, as always for Mitchell, superb. Morena Baccarin, as ""Anna"" the leader of the Visitors, manages a wonderful combination of beauty and creepiness.  Linda Vandervoort as ""Lisa,"" another Visitor well, she is just plain beautiful.  The special effects here are several cuts above what one expects to find on television.  This pilot hooked me on the series and for good reason.  Great entertainment.  RJB."
79537,"These have always been my favorite strings, and I've just about tried them all. Everything from elixirs, fenders, gibson, dunlop, and everything in between; I always end up coming back to ernie ball one way or another. Whether it be regular slinky or my ambitious not even slinky *they are a set of 12s* Overall great strings, never had a break on me, last long, sound pretty good too."
79538,"Zwipes is fast becoming another of my favorite brands. Their well priced innovative products are very impressive. From their used cotton feelZwipes (676-6PK) Burgundy 12"" x 25"" Waffle Weave Stemware and Bar Towel, (Pack of 6)towels that dry quickly for reuse to their reusableZwipes 746 Microfiber Honeycomb Side Scrubber Sponge- Pack of 4that provides great cleaning action with just water.The Zwipes Wash Mitt is no different. It works just as well as theMothers Genuine Lambswool Wash Mittwith the added bonus of being machine washable. The suds and cleaning action are just as good as any lambs wool mitt at a lower cost. I did line dry the mitt, and noticed that unlike lambs wool products dust/dirt particles did not get tangled into the fibers. You get a dust/dirt free mitt every car wash.Since it is a microfiber mitt, I also used it for dusting around the home and it worked very well picking up dirt around objects. The mitt, wrapped around your hand, provides a lot more control, though I would avoid working around small, expensive curios/figurines.Definite recommend!Pros:* Microfiber works just as great as more expensive lambs wool products* Good pile thickness and hundreds of tentacles (?) create great suds* Post your car wash the Mitt works well to wick away water from glass and other surfaces* Great for dry dusting around the home and auto* Machine washable* Dust/dirt does not get tangled in Mitt fibers* Well pricedCons:* None"
79539,"This is my favorite tv show.  I can hardly wait for the new season to start.  It has action, mystery, and terrific character development.  It is definitely an &#34;adult&#34; show because there is some violence and it feels so real that it can be a little scary.  Anyone who likes mystery and suspense would love this show."
79540,Where oh where did the bandido ride off to after Etta left and allegedly Sundance died in Bolivia?  This is an excellent extrapolation of that theory with a kicker.  Many believe both men survived their escapes and exploits in South Amerika and returned to the States.  This movie poses an interesting possibility of the famous Robert Leroy Parker.  There are so many unsubstantiated theories and alleged historical trails one has to wonder or wander about~  I did my own sleuthing and have a definitive theory on one person's end~
79541,This is a perfect (I can say better) replacement engine oil filter for my Mercedes-Benz E350. Amazon price is cheaper than any other auto part sellers and the OEM version of MB dealers. I'm fully satisfied with it from Amazon.
79542,"This is the most popular premixed blend that I have found. It's what our birds prefer, and it attracts the greatest variety. We live in the mid-atlantic region and have cardinals, grossbeaks, nuthatches, chickadees, carolina wrens, blue jays, and other species.The only blend that's better is when is when I buy separate bags of sunflower seed, cracked corn, and other seeds and blend it myself."
79543,Intriging and captivating.  Kept my interest and would continue to watch more episodes.  It was easy to download and watch via Amazon unbox.
79544,Great mouse traps. an upgrade to the wooden ones. My mice were licking the peanut butter off the wooden ones so i got these to try. the same night i caught one. These things will get them becaue they have to use there legs to trip the trap.
79545,"I really love this series.  When you have a boring life (like me), I enjoy viewing action type series.  Sometimes it gets a whole bunch  dark, but necessary to understand the storyline.  You will be &#34;hooked&#34; rather quickly in a good way by the urge to hole up in your home and watch all (3) seasons consecutively.  Enjoy!"
79546,"It wouldn't be too difficult to design a wider cutting blade that would create a wider 'trench' (although the motor might need some beefing up to handle the additional load) and it would be great if it was easier to get more depth too (it's possible but requires a little backyard re-engineering).  It's worth what it costs, though...I'm basically satisfied."
79547,This guitar strap performs as expected for it's price. Great entry level guitar strap for those just getting started (or for a backup strap).
79548,"if you know anything about oil filters, you know to stay away from cheapo stp, fram and other mass brand filters. These are much bigger and can filter more for longer periods of time. Keeps you oil cleaner for sure. Using this with synthetics is a no brainer. Can go longer from oil change to oil change if you want, but i keep mine from 3-5k."
79549,"I really appreciate the Rain X in a light drizzle or mist, when the water seems to disperse by itself with minimal windshield wiper use. When you apply before the cold weather, though, it helps prevent ice from sticking to your windshield, which is just great. I also like to use the product on the back window, which doesn't have a wiper, because it keeps the window clearer. Follow the directions--let it dry to a light haze and wipe it off with a microfiber or paper towel until the windshield is clear. I'm sure you'll like it."
79550,"It locks and unlocks well with a &#34;positive&#34; engagement feel when it is secure. Fits great for both my front bumper receiver and rear receiver on my 2005 Dodge Ram.  No complaints, and I'd definitely buy it again."
79551,"I will never not use Sta-bil in all my power equipment, except my everyday use car. Everything else gets the treatment. It is like it was mentioned in another review ""you never know when a toy or article will not get used for sometime."" So better safe than sorry. I apply this to the bulk gas dispensers I maintain and thus each time I refill a mower, edger, etc. it will get treated. In so far as my boat, I maintain a bottle on-board so it is readily available to apply whenever I refuel at an auto service station. I buy this from Amazon because I get it just about a buck cheaper than the local brick-n-mortar vendors because I have Amazon Prime which shipping is free and quick. I save mostly on sales tax and it's nice to have something come right up to your door, and not have to wait in line at the local Whale-Mart."
79552,I needed this type of funnel for different kinds of fluids and this works just right Good for getting into tight spaces.Good quality.Good price.
79553,"I don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing, but they need to go back to engineering school. When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position, they're quite difficult to pop open, and once opened into place, you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off, because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.It'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place, and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. I just don't like the features of this stand at all."
79554,good pedalthese pedals are perfectunder price excellent qualityI like the sound it is very goodI have 3 pedals and the pedalboard  behringer ******thank you for this product
79555,We thought this was creative and a lot of fun. As an extra bonus it has Noel Clark  (Rose's boyfriend from the Doctor Who series). I love a good creature feature and this really fits the bill.
79556,This is a well constructed little wood box. The metal is solid and there are grates on top and bottom which is nice. It can hold about a large handful of wood chips.The cover is difficult to open and close. It would be unsafe to try to remove the cover when it is hot. You certainly can use it without the top though which would work just as well.This box is not meant for slow-cooked smoking or barbecue-ing given the small size. It can't really handle big wood chunks which work well during smoking.The situation I can see this box being useful is for high heat grilling where you are looking for some real wood smoked flavor. You can place this smoker box right on the grates and shut your grill lid to create a smoky environment for your food. Leave the smoker box cover off which allows you to refill the box while cooking.The thing is you can easily replicate the function of this box by wrapping up wood chips in some aluminum foil which is far cheaper and easier to clean up (just throw it away).
79557,"Preview [HD] I did not enjoy this rather silly comedy/musical. It did not hold my attention and I would not watch it if it were offered on Amazon Prime.  The actors spontaneously breaking out in song did nothing for me.  There are musicals out there that are worth the price and time to watch....but Browsers was not one of them.  I have never cared for Glee either, so I guess its just not my cup of tea when it comes to comedy/musicals in general."
79558,"I'm not a big fan of electric power tools, but decided to give this a try, as I had an old one (bought at a yard sale for $2.00), and it worked very well for several years. I'm glad I did. Although I can't reach the far edges of my yard (even with a 100 foot cord, it does an excellent job around the areas that I trim most oftenIt's light weight - a plus for me as I have back problems."
79559,"You have to use a more creative word than, 'nice'.  Good 4 Star rating for a free Amazon Prime movie you never heard of. If it were a major release movie, 3 -- maybe, 2 stars. Very dysfunctional family who are fun to watch. The lead male is fun to watch and see how he keeps his awkward, stiff, stoic personality even when he's put in awkward situations by the free-spirited cute neighbor who asks him to write her obit. The family cast members are amusing and surprising."
79560,"The adjustable tension is a great idea and the open/close lever is designed in such a way that it sits behind the guitar neck and won't get in the way of your hands (unlike the capo I had before this one).  It even comes with a handy pick holder!I could make this review longer, but what else do you really need to know?  If you have a non-classical 6 string guitar, acoustic or electric, this guy should do the trick, regardless of neck shape.  Its a very well designed capo!"
79561,"These dissolvable tablets definitely seemed to have helped reduce, but not yet completely eliminate, the sickly-sour smell of the waste water in our travel trailer's gray water tank.  We live in our travel trailer full-time and dump the gray water tank about every three or four days.  That's when I notice the order.We've been dissolving one tablet down the kitchen sink drain after each dump and I like them enough to have ordered more.  I'll post an update in the future."
79562,"I HAVEN'T SEE ANY IMPROVE IN MILES, MOTOR SOUND LOOK THE SAME AS BEFORE USING THIS OIL; MAYBE IN THE LONG RUN COULD SEE SOMETHING, SO FAR IS THE SAME AS CONVENTIONAL .PRICE ON AMAZON, E-BAY AND PARTS STORE LIKE : AUTOZONE,O'REALLY, NAPA ARE TOO HIGH, $ 36 +,  SO GO TO WAL-MART THEY HAVE IT FOR $ 24 TO 25 A GALLON OF 5 Q."
79563,"Started out, not sure what was going on. but once it picked up, whoa! Started to have that Chris Carter feel to it and the ending was exciting and leaving me want more for sure!"
79564,"These work as advertised. Very sticky. Put them in my garage to catch mice and they do that, but they also catch anything that touches them. So far I caught mice, birds, lizards and a couple of squirrels. The squirrels run off with it but who cares."
79565,"I have to admit that I stand corrected. After Michael and Pam left Dunder-Mifflin last week, I was seriously concerned for the future of the show. I just couldn't see a world where Michael wasn't doing some kind of crazy, unproductive thing around the office while Pam and Jim play pranks on Dwight. However, in ""Dream Team,"" we were treated to something surprisingly entertaining and funny.The Michael Scott Paper company officially begins in Michael's condo. Michael puts together a ""dream team"" of people to kick things off. We finally get to see what happened to Ryan after he got out of prison for fraud and, it seems, returns to the cast for good. Michael and his team set out to find investors for their fledgling company, but run into trouble when it becomes clear that Michael has no clear idea what his company is or where its going. One of the dream team members jumps ship while Pam convinces Michael to continue with the company. Together, Michael, Pam and Ryan move into open office space in the same building as Dunder-Mifflin.Meanwhile, Jim makes a bad impression on his new boss, Charles, while Andy continues his usual brown-nosing antics. In order to change the Charles's view of him, Jim lies about his soccer-playing abilities. This leads to an office-wide soccer game where Dwight spends the entire time trying to expose Jim's lie.While there isn't too much screen time back at good old D-M, Michael and co. get much-needed time to play off one another. The ending does get a little serious, even for The Office, but the rest of the episode is so funny that it works. I found myself laughing out loud several times -in fact, more often than I have in recent Office episodes."
79566,I enjoyed every minute of this film. Such great casting and beautiful performances. It is best movie I have seen this year.
79567,"Vegas is a great show. It has good well developed characters played by outstanding seasoned actors. Although the story line could be just another cops and robbers, the setting, the unique psychology and varied motivation of each character makes for an interesting and engaging show."
79568,"I just installed this on my RV's spare tire. The material is nice and thick and It fit snugly, just as it should. Can't speak for it's longevity yet, as it's only been on there a couple of weeks. For the price though, I'm not expecting it to last more than a couple years. It'll be a nice surprise if it lasts more."
79569,"&#34;It started with white people moving into the neighborhood.&#34; Jack (Corddry) and Vanessa (Bibb) are expecting twins and have just moved into a new neighborhood. Before they can get settled they are told the history of the house they are in. Vanessa begins to experience strange things but doesn't realize it. Jack is worried and questions what is happening. So, what can I say about this. The group that did Reno 911 did this movie so that is the baseline to go off of. The jokes that were in Haunted House and Scary Movie 5 are pretty much repeated again here. Some of the jokes go on a little too long while others are funny at first but begin to tire after the repetition. It is hard to say too many bad things about this because the cast is funny and really carry the movie for as long as they can but like the other two movies I mentioned it can't sustain laughs the entire time. This is a movie that would be better watched in twenty minute segments rather then all at once. Overall, a movie that is funny but gets repetitive and loses steam toward the end. I give it a B-."
79570,"Bolts on easy enough.  Like others have mentioned it isn't &#34;level&#34; and your antenna will tilt.  Furthermore, any antenna I would have used wouldn't have cleared the stock Jeep spare tire so I had to make a modification (another bracket) to mount to this one.  If I had to do it over again, I would have just made my own bracket in the beginning."
79571,Many interesting characters and unexpected events challenge your thinking on survival dynamics  of small groups of people. The series focuses on the social implications of inexplicable disaster. It reminds me of Journal of the Plague Year by Camus because the social and ethical thinking changes as the trouble progresses.
79572,iCarly is a good show the entire family can watch; this show is enjoyed by all of the kids in my neighborhood up to about 8th grade.  The jokes are pretty funny and what I really like the most as a parent is the show doesn't cross the line like a lot of children-focused shows seem to do with being a tad risqu&eacute;.We have watched all of the episodes of this season for free via our Prime membership vs. the regular price of $24.99 for the whole season: not a bad deal!
79573,"I have several overdrive pedals, some of which are much more expensive than the BOSS SD-1. For a long time I overlooked my SD-1 and used other pedals. But when I went back to trying the SD-1, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this relatively inexpensive pedal is superior to some of the pedals I had been using. I don't mean merely that it's ""very good relative to its price""; I mean that it's ""very good--period."" It easily outclasses some pedals for which I paid much more. The price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about $45 on Amazon. At that price, it's an amazingly good deal. Note: This is definitely an overdive pedal; it will not deliver metal distortion (at least not by itself). If you want to ride the crazy train, look elsewhere (like Deltalab's Metal Distortion pedal). What this produces is smooth old-style overdrive. It's excellent. It sounds especially good through a dash of chorus. I plug my SD-1 into a Fender Mustang II amp and turn on the amp's chorus; the result is delicious. I've used the SD-1 with both single-coil and double-coil pickups. Both sound good, though, not surprisingly, you get a heavier punch with a humbucker. But it sounds great with single-coils too."
79574,"Fantastic, creative, spellbinding, this has it all. I am looking forward to the second half of this season coming back very soon."
79575,This plug is a must if you winterized your own trailer to blow the water from the lines so they don't freeze.
79576,"The 24 series were a really good series, with a lot of action, great lines,and some interesting plots.This new cut to half season is really not interesting.It is a copycut of all the elements that made the original series a successbut given in a boring and predictable way. No real interesting twists really.Of course you must watch it in order to listen to the voice of Jack Bauer once moreand because it is an action series.But do not think that it is anything like the previous 24s"
79577,"Everest EZ Series Shoulder Rest for 4/4 Violin is very good deal, if you are learning to play a violin.It helps you to keep the violin in right position all the time."
79578,"These are fantastic kitchen towels. Lightweight, takes up less space in a drawer than cotton towels. Because they are microfiber they wear like iron and sterilize with one washing without soaking. Six towels might just be enough to last a life time."
79579,"i love suits the two main characters are fantastic,and this show even gets you to love all of the supporting characters,this is one show where i am going to have to buy the blu rays i could watch it over and over, it is intelligent, and funny in the best kind of ways see for yourself:)"
79580,"I am amazed at how much water these towels will absorb and when I dry my car, it leaves it streak free.  The waffle weave design of this towel holds a remarkable amount of water when I'm drying my car. After washing my car, I squeegee off the excess water and then I used the water magnet towel. I can dry the entire car to perfection and never have to wring out the towel. I only occasionally wash this towel and only with plain laundry detergent that contains no fabric softeners or additives.  I consider this to be my prize drying towel."
79581,"So much has been said of this show already.  Let's get to the point:Half the cast is great.  Half the cast is too green, inexperienced, and frankly young.  No one will believe that SHIELD agents should look like the rejected cast of Friends.  The show makers do not take the organization seriously.  SHIELD, instead of being a hardened group of super agents, is a gaggle of barely legal noobs.The show burdens us with forced humor, corny dialogue, and uninteresting scenes.There are no superheroes or supervillains taken advantage of.  Instead of mining the rich depths of Marvel lore, they hand us a brainfart of a hero who jumps out of a burning building and SHOCKS everyone.  Shocks everyone!?!  Really!?!  In world where aliens just invaded!?!  Where a Norse GOD just said hello!?!  Where Iron Man flies around?  Where the INCREDIBLE HULK just saved everyone's lives!?!The atmosphere of the show is one akin to the old A-Team series.  Violence with no consequences.  Boring or lame characters introduced each show.  Obviously manufactured storylines.  There is no atmosphere of foreboding, mystery, awe, or fear.  Which, to me, seems integral to the success of a show trying to display mankind's reaction to the burgeoning supervillain-and-monster-infested reality we all find ourselves living in.What a flop.  Avoid at all costs.  It does not take the Marvel Universe seriously.  It adds nothing.  Instead of presenting SHIELD as an investigative, subterfuge-filled, espionage-oriented, and artifact retrieval unit struggling to even the odds for mankind, this show gives us a flaccid comedic parody of the deadly serious organization from the comics.Stan Lee help us."
79582,My Daughter loves Caillou. It's one of the few programs I let her watch. When the weather turns nice we'll spend as much time as possible outside but till then this is a winner for young children.
79583,"The music. The characters, The thought of having a show to watch like this...I need this in my life. I thought it was awesome."
79584,"It's hard to imagine any soil worse than the native soil in my garden and my yard.  Here in Texas, we call it caliche, and you truly could use it as clay on a potter's wheel.  That's why I've been composting veggie scraps and yard trimmings.  The compost that results helps the garden (and increases the worms).  My problem has been that composting is slow.  This Ringer Compost Plus  helps speed the process, so I can build soil that will nourish my plants.I have not measured the temperature in my composter, but in spite of the fact that our weather has been much cooler than normal, the material I put in the composter a month ago has been turning into soil quite nicely.  Ringer says to expect composting to complete in 60 to 90 days, but I'm seeing results much sooner than that.  I'm ready to turn out my first batch of the year tomorrow.In addition to working quickly, this product is a bargain, costing about half of the compost starter I had been using.If you have an interest in improving your soil and putting the scraps from kitchen and yard to good use, try this.  It works!"
79585,"Splat is an orange colored glop. It feels like something a kid would like on Halloween. It's kind of fun actually. More importantly, this product solves a problem that has bugged us all at one time or another: it gets those crumbs and bits of stuff out of hard-to-reach cracks and crevices. You know, like the space on the center console of the car where crud accumulates next to the automatic transmission lever. I have tried everything from cotton swabs to pencil points. That stuff just refused to leave.Another problem place is the small spaces on a computer keyboard or a laptop. You can't use liquid cleaners unless you want to short out the computer. Another one of those petty daty-to-day problems.Enter Splat (what a great name!). Just take some of the stuff and jam it into those hard-to-reach spots and Viola! the dirt comes up with the goop when you remove it. Even better, the stuff is reusable. Just stuff it back into its jar, tighten the lid and save it for the next time you want to get some crud out of a small place.Bottom line: this stuff is great. It works as advertised, gets the job done, and doesn't appear to leave any residue. It's also non-toxic and reusable. This stuff is truly a bargain. It works, it's fun, and you can use it to scare your friends. Cool!"
79586,This guitar stand was very inexpensive and very easy to assemble.  I have no complaints about this stand at all
79587,"This first season is hopefully not the last that Amazon will offer on Prime. I recommend suspending judgment until the third episode, which is when I started to care about the characters and wanted to know what would happen to them. Romola Garai is beautiful in the role of tv news producer, so beautiful that I was willing to stop being suspicious about such a one getting that job in the 1950s. I would watch Anna Chancellor in anything, and she is such great fun in The Hour as the cynical (on the surface) Lix Storm, seasoned reporter. It's Ben Wishaw playing Freddie Lyon that clinches it, and makes The Hour five-star material. He is awesome."
79588,"This is only heat treated die cast zinc but covered by a lifetime warrantee (Limited to proper use).As such it should last okay, however don't abuse it, if the piston is that stuck your going to need to do the calliper anyway."
79589,I have been using these for many years now. I even have one on my car. Quick and easy to plug and unplug the battery tender!
79590,This is the fourth season of a good down to earth police show!  The morgue is not to gruesome!  I would call this o.k. for people above 13 years of age.
79591,"This episode wasn't very good. Similar humour to Workaholics, but definitely not as funny.  If it got picked up, I might give it another chance.  The characters are decent and the premise might work, but not many of the jokes land."
79592,Under the Dome continues with none of the intensity lost and Mr King made his usual appearance at the diner counter.  It continues to lead one to the conclusions and reasons for the event as all of Mr King's stories have done.  I am enjoying this season as much as last season and recommend it to all sci fi fantasy buffs as it caters to both camps.
79593,Be aware I believe it has a pressure limit of under 3000 I believe which is fine for most people..  My son uses it has had no problems cleaned a huge driveway and it worked well and fast he said
79594,"Got this product for my Tea Plant - was mostly wanting to use something other than rocks in the bottom, and wasn't too concerned about overall weight.  (The dirt will make the planter weight more anyway.)  Overall, this seems to be a somewhat cleaner way to use a big planter.  Good idea, good design, and my tea plant is still going strong.With that said, something isn't right with the price.  The 9.5"" version of it is going for 3-4 bucks, but Amazon has it for around 20.  This 11.5"" one...for 30+ dollars?  I would strongly encourage you to not buy it at that price.  For what you get, it should be under 10 dollars, probably closer to 5-7.  You can find via 3rd party sellers here on Amazon and at brick and mortar stores for that price.Overall, the product itself seems to work well, and it's easy to cut down to size.  (If you're planning on cutting it, consider just getting the roll of it -Garden Genius GG-ROLL-1 Durable Pot Filler Roll, 12-Inch x 52-Inch- which is actually reasonably priced.Would recommend product, but again, make sure the price your paying makes sense!"
79595,"I think that is what it is about.It doesn't solve some great world issue or something.Just how to feel about your life.I did sit through the whole movie, without having to pause it and take a break where I could later continue.That's what I have to do to a lot of movies, either that or just discontinue altogether.This one is tolerable because as improbable as it might seem, it is possible, and did not overly strain my credulity."
79596,The show was a bit of a slow starter for me but once it got going I found the shows to be interesting and I am looking forward to next season
79597,"The second show of the new season continues the mystery of the Doctor's new companion while providing an excellent mystery and a great last minute heroic save- although I would say it's not up to the best episodes in really delivering tension and suspense. Where's that moment of terror, that doubt in the Doctor's mind, that point where we wonder if he'll be able to even pull it off?  But still a good show.As for the streaming- not so good. I'm paying for HD and getting low-res With a 12Mbit connection this shouldn't be an issue, and it hasn't been with Netflix. Hopefully Amazon can find out why streaming appears to be choking at their end."
79598,Very nice product. Strings feel and sound noticeably better plus the white mineral oil smells really good when applied to the neck.
79599,Too bad the show was cancelled.  I really enjoyed watching it.  The character development and the plot twists kept me engaged.  I would love to have seen a second season.
79600,"i've been using these tortex picks for a few years now and won't buy any others.  they feel great, don't fall out of my hands, and have a decent life span (plus the turtle logo is sweet)"
79601,Im sure the cable works good but i havent tried it to jumpstart a car. It says it handles up tp V8 cars. The thing i dont like is that it feels loose and cheap on the contact ends they might break
79602,I replaced my bed lights with a couple of these and they are ok. I was hoping for something a little brighter but the don't list the lumens.
79603,"I have just used this product for the first time today. I have been using another very popular interior detailer. I used the other detailer just a short time ago and thought the interior was clean. Einszett Premium not only lifted a lot more grime off my vinyl dash and door panels, it is not slick like the other detailer/cleaner. I will be using Einzett from now on."
79604,No need for any kinda Velcro or tape to hold these ... they are stuffed and a tad bit over-sized for a standard vent and they fit snug in there PERFECTLY! I'm sure it helps a tiny bit holding in heat and also works to block out light coming from the clear vent top. Great buy.
79605,"This show is my guilty pleasure. This season we are no closer to figuring out who A is! It's like a train wreak, you don't want to watch but you can't look away! I started reading the pretty little liars books and now I'm more aggravated! But I won't stop until I reach the end of either one!"
79606,"The Americans is the story of a married couple of KGB spies planted in Washington DC during the Reagan era. The 1980s timeshift alone is enough to intrigue, given the heightening tensions with the USSR, and the surveillance and counter intelligence operations in a world without cell phones and laptops. But the show is carried expertly by the two principal actors who balance the demands of a family life with the complex and dangerous missions supplied by their agency, and it's really the plot of their personal lives that keeps the audience coming back for more.The show is very carefully plotted to ensure that amid growing suspense, it doesn't start to become ludicrous. As much as I loved the first season of Homeland, this is one of the flaws in its execution - by the time the screenwriters had Brody murdering the Vice President, it started to strain under its own ridiculousness. The Americans pushes the envelope with each episode but never so far to break the consistency of the characters.Although it features strong action sequences, these play second fiddle to the paranoia of managing a double life - one that involves raising children in a foreign country under a false identity, and another about infiltrating that country under the allegiance of another. This presents a dilemma for the audience too since our heroes are villains and we can't help but feel a twang of betrayal as we hope they succeed in their missions.Overall, I can't recommend The Americans enough especially if you have enjoyed Homeland or House of Cards. It's yet again another reminder that the best drama is happening on TV rather than in the movies right now."
79607,This great product keeps all of my gas powered vehicles and equipment running great. I absolutely love it! Thank you!
79608,Absolutely fabulous! The relationships between the characters keeps you wanting to know what's going to happen next. The &#34;hillbillies&#34; in this show are as conniving as any city person I've ever known.
79609,I ordered these gloves because it seemed like a good deal for the price.  Problem is I can't even get them on my hands!  They are too small and I can't even return them for a larger pair (say XL or XXL) because apparently they only come in large.  So I end up keeping them and I still don't have a warm pair of gloves to use when I want to ride my bike and it is cold.  They did seem like a decent glove but I can't rate them on use or performance since I can't get my hands in them.
79610,I am not sure I have noticed a big difference as so many have noted....but it makes me feel like i am giving my jeep the best...
79611,"but it is not very easy to get on, so often I just use it as a hot pad and not put it on"
79612,"This is the best cleaning product I've ever used. Not only do I use it on my maple and rosewood fretboards, but I also use it on the headstock if it's unfinished and on the unfinished body of my Ukulele. What it does is it restores the wood in a way that it gives it a much more brilliant, beautiful and lively tone. Really brings out the beauty of true wood. Now every fretboard and unfinished bit of wood on my guitars looks beautiful and brand new. Application method is also very useful. I don't know why there is a strict warning saying not to use it on maple fretboards; I put it on my Stratocaster's maple fretboard and it looks beautiful. The only thing it did differently was it made the fretboard a good shade darker. I also must add that the stuff has a very wonderful lemony smell (nowhere near overpowering), and it does clean off a lot of dirt in conjunction to hydrating and livening the wood. Great stuff. Go ahead and buy it."
79613,"Not before nor since, has there been anything as funny as I Love Lucy!  PS The fact that I am supposed to continue to comment after I have said all that was needed to say is just silly"
79614,"I've painted with brushes, rollers, small air compressor guns and spray paint cans, as I use what ever will give me the best smoothest streak free finish for my many house and yard paint projects. This Wagner Flexio 590 Indoor/Outdoor Hand Held Sprayer System will give me the professional smooth finishes I need in my painting in way, way less time. This system comes with the X-Boost Turbine handle, the iSpray nozzle, the detail finish nozzle, 2 filters in the Turbine handle, 2 funnels, a practice spray poster, thinning accessory, a carrying case to hold everything in and the owner's manual.  The directions are extremely thorough and after reading everything and practicing using this sprayer's 2 different nozzles, you will be so pleased with the perfect professional results, you will not want to use a brush or roller ever again.As with all paint jobs, prep work is everything, and it is no different with a hand held sprayer. You want to clean whatever it is you are painting first and mask the border. I found the overspray to be minimal with this sprayer, but masking is still needed. Once you are ready for painting, just be sure you do a couple of practice sprays first, to get the feel of the sprayer and to see how keeping the handle straight and steady with even sweeping motions will keep the sprayer from spitting or spraying too thin or thick. You'll see that moving constantly and distance is everything also. When you first use the practice poster with the iSpray nozzle, you will see that you will be 6-12 inches away to get a spray of 10 to 12 inches wide. Then when you practice with the detail finish nozzle, you'll find you'll spray 1 to 6 inches away for a spray 1/2 inch to 3 inches wide. Steady, straight sweeping motions will give you perfect results.Once you mix the material you will be using, you will want to adjust the controls by setting your air power and material flow control. The materials you use with the iSpray nozzle can be from thin sealers to medium polyurethanes to heavy latex paints or primers. The incredible thing about this iSpray nozzle is that you don't have to thin the materials with water. You can thin them if you like, as it will mean cleaning the nozzle hole less while painting, but I found that when I sprayed constantly and steadily for a while the sprayer didn't clog or spit until I stopped to rest my arm and began again. At this point I simply unclogged the sprayer hole with the thinning accessory, did a practice spray and went back to spraying again. The thinning accessory tells you how much water to add to the container to thin your paint or material besides having a tip to keep the nozzle hole clean.As for the detail finish nozzle, this sprayer hole is so tiny, you absolutely have to thin your material no matter what you are using to paint or stain with. Thinning is a must for this detail nozzle and you will be impressed with the perfect results you will get. For both nozzles, you can adjust the spray shape, but you can only adjust the spray width on the iShape nozzle.The owner's manual also covers proper spraying techniques for both wide and detailed spraying. I find that simply practicing will give you all you need in learning distance and adjustments to get the results you need. When finished painting, cleanup is unbelievably easy. You basically want to flush the unit with water half full for water based materials or one quarter full of mineral spirits for oil based materials. After flushing, you just take the nozzle apart and I just let it soak in a bucket of soapy water. Then take a soft brush to it, dry and remember to use vaseline on the O ring before putting it back together again. The reassembly of the nozzle is pictured in the manual, so you don't have any worries after it's apart in pieces. The only maintenance you'll have is cleaning the 2 filters and cleaning the air valve tube on the iSpray nozzle.Painting is a huge job, with lots of prep work and cleanup time, so anything that cuts down on the actual time spent painting is a huge plus for me and this Wagner sprayer makes it so much easier with it's super fast wide and detailed sprayers, which can be mastered with just a little practice. Walls, baseboards, trims, ceilings, fences, house siding, furniture, decks and even crafts turn out with a beautiful professional smooth finish when spraying with this great sprayer system and it is definitely a 4 1/2 Star time saver."
79615,"It is a clear liquid, it doesnt turn as black as the rust reformer that looks like milk. But maybe it does as good, just dont know yet."
79616,I got this in case I ever needed to siphon gas because I would not want to suck gas into my mouth.
79617,I kind of lived this life so I hated this movie although I like Richard Gere.  Reminded me too much of the arrogance and selfishness of this kind of man and of the woman willing to go along with it.
79618,"I use these handles on my 2014 2 door Wrangler.  Great buy for the money.  Well built, easy to install and they look good.  I almost broke the bank looking for a set of grab handles and then stumbled on these.  Glad I did."
79619,"After receiving theDunlop Dual Design Straplok Systemalready installed on my Gibson Standard electric(7.36 lbs.), and liking them, I decided to try installing them on my Gibson Studio electric (7.23 lbs.). Noproblem. Just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly.I had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation. Money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground. Besides safety I also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars. It's a nice convenience. If you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars.If you are not sure if they will work on your brand guitar seek out an online forum and either search thatforum for the answer or join and ask your questions. You've got a pricy piece of wood there and will wantto take care of it properly.What I don't care for, but feel okay with because they work so well, is how big they seem to be. Theydon't get in the way when being used but look almost out of place. That is why I chose Black for mysecond set. Helps keep the product's profile down a bit. Other than that, the product works asadvertised....NOTE: As of June 2014 I have installed two other sets and all are still working as expected. Do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure. After repeated use the screws can come loose and therewill be trouble if this happens. Do NOT use any glue in case you need to swap out the Straploks in thefuture."
79620,After a little bit of configuration headaches I can confirm this product works quite well with ardour2 and is my prefered method of mixing. For the price it's a really good deal.
79621,"This is an update to my original review in June 2010, which was very positive.This IS a nice product, producing copious suds that last, good at cleaning the vehicle.  So, nothing new there.However, I always wondered about the claims of the wash containing carnauba and polymers. Since one normally has to buff waxes off the car, just HOW did this product leave these wax type finishes on a car? Why wouldn't you have to buff this after using it?Then it occurred to me. My black car always has a good wax finish - do I NEED to be putting something from a wash in addition to that? When I wash a car, I hose it down, mix up the sudsy shampoo, wash all areas, squeegie off the water with a silicon blade and finish up by wiping up any remaining droplets/moisture with one of those damp, ChamWow type, high absorbancy felt towels. This worked fine, BUT, with the Meguiar's, I always had to follow up on the glass with an additional buffing from a bath type towel. If I didn't buff the windows, even though they had been wiped clean of droplets by the ChamWow, they would be very streaked/spotted in the direct sunlight. So, although I didn't see direct streaking of the paint, I have to assume that it had the same issue as the unbuffed windows, given I wasn't buffing the car paint itself.I actually had gone to buy a new bottle of the Meguiar's. Hadn't paid much attention to prices, in that I always want a good shampoo. But then I noticed that this product is twice the price of other name brand shampoos such as Black Magic and Rain-X. PLUS, this product calls for 1 oz per GALLON, whereas those others call for 1 oz per BUCKET. So, it's actually FOUR times the price of the others.So, came back with the Black Magic, which is just a cleaning shampoo. At 1 oz per bucket (vs. the Maquiar's 2) it foamed very well, but didn't last quite as long. But, long enough to get the job done with foamy soap. I DID notice that the windows weren't streaked and car actually DOES seem to have a better shine - but have to admit, that could be wishful thinking.So, in conclusion, think this product leaves some sort of film on the car, and not a glassy one. There are plenty of options out there at 1/4 the cost, that leave NO film.  If you are willing to pay four times the price, suspect you already keep your vehicle waxed, so the dubious benefit of this product containing waxes as protectants, is a waste of money as well as leaving a less that sparkling clean finish on the car."
79622,"I have mice in my outside shed.  I think they are chewing the insulation off my water heater pipes.  This is a little puzzling to figure out but now I got it and it won't be hard anymore.  One tab has to be held back while you pinch the tabs for the insert where you put the bait.  It's in an easy to handle block, and evidently the mice have to go into a twisted tunnel to get to it.  I suppose that's good to keep pets and kids out and I guess it's enough for a mouse to get through."
79623,I was looking for a sound hole pickup and this came as one of the best and found it to be all I expected. I use it for practice and recording myself. I really like it but for the price I wish it had just a bit more otherwise its perfect. I have it on my 1994 Martin D-18  which has a big bottom end and no matter what it always sounds fine. I have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good.
79624,I am extremely hard on microfiber towels. My ADHD kicks in and I suddenly go from the fender to the inside of the wheel where caked on brake grime resides. Needless to say I washed the towels right in the garage sink and had fantastic results.
79625,I hate string noise and a dirty acoustic. This kit covers all the bases from the fret board to the body. My favorite acoustic guitar is over 40 years old and it looks like a brand new guitar and no annoying string noise when I am changing chords or fingering the fret-board.
79626,"In April, at the height of our moth activity, I bought a box of these traps and placed one, per the instructions, underneath the cupboard. Three days later, all I'd found inside was a gray smudge where a moth apparently managed to free itself from the glue. I was frustrated and posted a 1-star review.Just over a month later I happened to look inside the trap, and I was stunned. Both sticky surfaces are now covered with moths and even a few flies. I haven't touched the trap, and I'm not sure what happened, but I've completely revised my opinion. You may now consider me very pleased with my purchase."
79627,I just started using it and ordered another one today.  I am a garden person with many flowers all over the place.  Nozzles are important to me.  This one is by far the best I've ever used.  Reaches far and many patterns that I can choose.  Nothing better.
79628,"I was kinda worried about putting non-honda transmission fluid in my civic.  From reading many various honda forums, honda automatics usual don't do well with non-factory tranny fluid.  However, several of the members stated that they had good experience using D4 in their civics so I decided to get it a try.  After using D4, my tranny immedately started shifting smoother.  After about 2000 miles so far, I couldn't be happier, the tranny is performing like when it was new.  I'm very happy with this product."
79629,Liked it a lot but not finished watching whole series...might get five stars yet! Recommend it though! For a really invigorating hunger -free mealtime..(snicker)
79630,"NO SPOILERSThe answer is 52 and it represents the number of TV appearances by Gina Torres (Senior Partner Jessica Pearson), which includes stints on Alias, Firefly and Angel!  Then there is Rick Hoffman (Junior Partner Louis Litt) who is ""annoyingly good"" be it as a Wall Street Sales Guy sending an intern to Brooklyn to get a bagel or a fast talking ADA.These veterans anchor the 2-main characters:Gabriel Macht (New Senior Partner and Rising Star Harvey Specter)Patrick Adams (Pseudo Lawyer Mike Ross)Honorable Mention:Meagan Markle (The ""Tasty"" Paralegal Rachel)Sarah Rafferty (Mike's Longtime Assistant Donna)The show is equal part Mike learning how to be a Lawyer under Harvey's tutelage, equal part scrambling to keep Mike's secret and equal part character interaction: Mike with Rachel, Harvey with Jessica and Louis with everyone.  Then there is Donna that protects Harvey with the ferocity of either a sibling or one who might hold repressed feelings.This is a show that I feel would have a chance in The Fall Prime Time Schedule."
79631,"I keep on coming back hoping my disappointment has eluded me into thinking it is a frightening bad show, but I continually get proven my synopsis is right--this is truly that bad. Can we get it over with and make the dome collapse on this dismal failure?"
79632,"Great strings. I use these on a Deering Goodtime II and they work well. Deering recommends (as I imagine most entry level banjo manufacturers) sticking with only the light gauge, not light pluses or mediums. So stock up. Good strings, and not overly prone to corrosion."
79633,Bought this tape to fix some mouldings and attach door guards to my car. Been about six months and the guards are securely fastened. Our summers are quite hot and typically I have found that with other tapes the adhesive becomes soft. No problems with this tape. Tribute to 3M.
79634,Love this product.....awesome why use anything else to grow? the aireation and simplicity of this is well perfect! Ill never use anything else
79635,Great show
79636,used this around my Hostas that were being severely munched upon.  Quickly noticed the difference and first treatment has lasted several weeks now.  Also used around my basil.Very impressed with the performance and a little has gone a long way.
79637,"This is a quality garden hose.  It's very thick/heavy & the fittings are sturdy.  It's even drinking water safe so you can use this to water pets, etc.  The hose is made by Swan for Scotts.  I have several Swan hoses that I've used/owned for about 18 years.  I don't exactly baby my hoses so that is impressive.  I expect this hose will hold up also.  It is &#34;kink resistant&#34; but you will still be able to kink it if you don't handle it properly.  But this one is better than most.  I'll let you know by July if it's still &#34;kink free&#34;.  My experience has been that it takes a few months for the better &#34;kink free&#34; hoses to start kinking. :)"
79638,"Vera is a straight forward no nonsense detective who leads a team of police officers to solve homicides. If you enjoy police procedurals, then you will enjoy this series."
79639,"I bought eleven of these in order to hang a bunch of my guitars and I found them to be extremely simple and quick to install.  The included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue, leaving the String Swing solidly connected to the wall.If you are hanging a lot of guitars, making two rows (one high and one low) seems to be the best option.  I spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars I put up look nice and have a good, tight spacing.  I uploaded two pictures of my wall after I had installed nine of the hangers and I couldn't be more pleased with the look... the pictures are uploaded on this product page.  I have put up the other two hangers since I uploaded the pictures, so I will have to do new pictures, but the ones that I put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with these.The easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as theBlack & Decker BDL100AV All-In-One SureGrip Laser Leveland a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall.  I just went down the wall making dots directly on the line, drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about 20 - 30 minutes.  I think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professional-looking installation.As far as the performance of the hangers goes, what is there to say?  The included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it.  As long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly, you will be in good shape.I DO NOT, however, recommend buying theString Swing Home and Studio Wall Bumper Brown, as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediately.EDIT: I put the other hangers up now and did NOT drill pilot holes.  The anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole.  Just mark the positions, use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion, then screw them in.  It took about 1 minute to put a new hanger up, but this was partially due to the fact that I was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line.  At any rate, you do not need to drill pilot holes; just nail and go!"
79640,"Fantastic! Great quality, no buffering. My son loves Sesame Street! It's great he can watch it anytime with amazon prime!"
79641,"This season of DD is not as unconventionally light-hearted as the previous seasons.  The program has begun to feel a little staged, but it is till good, and clean, and respectful of MY values, unlike many of the offerings today."
79642,"the cable hisses, crackles and pops right out of the package.  save your money and buy a better cable.  i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective.  i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else."
79643,"I do live shows online, and my older Behringer mixer does not have the built in USB port, so these digitizers do a great job for me.  I constantly get comments about how clean and clear my sound is, and while I largely attribute that to the mixer, this digitizer is just as important a link in the chain.  Very simple to use, audio out of the mixer goes into this digitizer, plug the USB cable into my computer, my streaming software sees it, and people hear me.  I am definitely a Behringer fan."
79644,"Quentin Tarantino thinks it's the &#34;best film of the year,&#34; which is strange because -- for all of his attention to the slick, candy-like gloss that makes a film fun to watch, he's also pretty good at things like story and subtext and characters. This film is very crisply filmed, with every scene and twitch and frame almost exquisitely composed, but the story itself is so uninspired that it puts the mind to sleep like a rich, heavily-frosted cake laced with sedatives.The title/poster gives you the impression that it's a story about three bad guys. You have a sniveling religious studies teacher who is accused of raping and murdering a series of little girls. You have a disgraced cop who has gone beyond the badge to capture him. And you have the latest little girls' father choosing to mete a little vigilante justice to find the last remains of his child (and to get some blood-soaked closure). The theme here isn't anything new: when the good guys are willing to do anything to catch and punish the bad guy, do they still remain good?In spite of every perfectly timed shot, beautifully acted nuance, and gorgeously orchestrated moment, the story itself lacks any kind of meat, despite the prevalence of burnt flesh, broken bones, and shredded skin. Probably the biggest narrative snafu is that viewers never learn why the dad and cop are so convinced that the teacher is guilty of the crimes. The movie jumps right into the back-alley beatdowns without letting us know what evidence damns this poor, balding educator, making the whole thing feel lopsided (and giving astute viewers a big clue as to what they can expect at the end -- I'm not the brightest bulb, but I still managed to figure out what the final shot would be).To take up space, the movie uses violence, goofy juxtapositions (most of them involving phone calls from an elderly lady just when torture is about to happen), a wee bit of misdirection (a completely pointless Arabian man on horseback in this film full of Israelis), and some dark humor (done well, to be fair). All of it is shot and directed masterfully -- again, to be fair -- but it's like the world's most beautiful dress being put on a corpse. Ultimately, in spite of its solid acting and sumptuous visuals, the story is so fallow that it doesn't have the impact or drive that the rest of its talent deserves."
79645,"It's wonderful to finally see this excellent series brought to life.  Titus captures Harry Bosch perfectly.  He is tough, but humane.  The supporting cast is just as effective, especially his Lieutenant.  Little too much hint at a love (or sex) interest for my taste and to stay true to the books, but I suppose that's to be expected.I definitely hope this becomes a full-blown series."
79646,"...but found the information interesting.  The Celts originating in Austria????  Who knew.  This seemed to be a more historically accurate story of the Celts.  Being of Irish heritage I found it interesting to learn that some of the stories I'd heard were not accurate, with regard how the Celts came to be in Ireland and other parts of Europe."
79647,"Wait, Veronica is a freshman at imaginary U!  Not being a fan of the original Veronica Mars series, I found this one hard to swallow and even harder to engage in.  Maybe old fanboys and girls will enjoy seeing their favorite characters &#34;aged&#34; for this new series, but as a newcomer I found little to like or engage me."
79648,"Need for Speed is the feature film adaptation of the hit video game franchise of the same name that centers around Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul), who is framed for the accidental death of his friend. Then, after two years in prison, Tobey seeks revenge on Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper), the man who caused the death of Tobey's friend.The movie isn't nearly as bad as critics are making it out to be. I'd say (because so many compare it to the Fast and Furious franchise), it's better than the first four F&F; films. Firstly, the production. Zero CGI, all practical effects and stunts. It was with Scott Waugh's direction this was possible, the man who co-directed Act of Valor. The use of real cars and stunt-work was extremely impressive, and made the film all the more impressive and entertaining. But, it was the cheesy script that made Need for Speed simply a fun, fast-paced action movie. Happily, this isn't necessarily a bad thing; the emotional moments of the movie are well-done, and the fun moments are fun. But, the acting of two of the supporting actors was not that great, at all. Even Dominic Cooper's role as the antagonist was really over-the-top, which is too bad considering how talented the man is. Happily, Aaron Paul delivers in a generic but &#34;real&#34; character, and Imogen Poots was really good as Julia Maddon, an Englishwoman who purchased a car built by Tobey and his crew. The musical score was good (I did a separate review for it on the official Soundtrack page), the cinematography was captivating, and the editing was seamless.Overall, Need for Speed is not your generic blockbuster, it's not pure &#34;popcorn&#34; entertainment, but it's not great either. If you love the video game franchise, you will love this movie; it brings some of the iconic races to life on the big screen in a great way. But also what's really nice about the film, is that it's a classic action movie. There are no gunfights, no brawls, just straight-up action-packed car sequences."
79649,I really enjoyed this movie (must be my Celtic roots).....good comedic parts and nice emotional pace.  Loved the small town setting!
79650,"It takes time to install and figure out the settings, I am not sure about the long term use, and I will post an update as soon as I notice the results."
79651,Looked great and is easy to install.
79652,The first 4 seasons were great. I binged watched them. As in one episode after another. There are four characters that could be a lead in any show. I don't know who cast this show but the women are the finest of the fine. Eva is just incredible. Her range of emotions is incredible. For most everyone I would suggest giving this series a try.Chuck
79653,Off to a slow start in episode one but shows promise. I will continue with that hope and give a more in depth eval.
79654,"Sorry guys, didnt like this one. I hated Lez Miserables because it sang EVERY word.  I felt a little dread during the opening scene of Browsers.  Not sure why there is this mash-up of SMASH & THE OFFICE. For me, it doesnt work.  What does work for me is Bebe Neuwirth. She was great!"
79655,"Works just fine for the Tascam DP-008 I also bought through Amazon, and saves a lot of batteries. What else can you say? It works."
79656,Ok why do we have to wait so long not just for Bones but all the other DVD TV series on a yearly basis? We don't get paid for TV here and so depend on the series by DVD arrivals. Of course we then scarf them up so quick within less than a week usually...it's one heck of a long wait for next years episodes. Yes we occasionally sneak peaks via the free net viewers in 2 x 3 frames but that only wets the appetite and our impatience even more. So if anyone is listening that decides these dates.....why not put them out within a 2-3 week ending of the season? Meantime the show...BONES is by far our favorite. I didn't like it for the first original 3 episodes but the 4th began to thaw me and by the 5th I was hooked. Writing is tight and casting tighter. Love the comedy most of all. Sure they could improve this or that to make me like it even more...but hey life is a compromise.If you gave this a try when it first came out but wasn't taken in...go back and give it another look. I wasn't quite taken by last years plot of making Zack a serial killer. That definitely weird for weirds sake. Nothing like writing a character off without exactly killing him off traditionally. I never warmed to Zacks character...so I don't miss him or feel for his persona living behind those cold cold bars:) Hope it runs another 5 years......or more.....
79657,"I purchased this Acton scanner 2 years ago when our older vehicle was repeatedly showing its MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp). I was able to clear the code immediately. When the MIL illuminated again later, I was able to track down the problem (O2 sensor heater trouble)and correct it by reseating the connector. Later, I used the scanner to diagnose which cylinder was misfiring. By tapping on that cylinder's fuel injector, I was able to correct the misfiring. Again, the Acton cleared the MIL display.My mechanic uses a more sophisticated (and much more expensive) OBD scanner in his day to day work, but for someone who does occasional maintenance on his own car, this tool is worth the $89 investment. If you paid more, you paid too much."
79658,"Most people who try infrared grills think it's the best thing since sliced bread.Pros:- This grill runs hot! and produces an excellent sear on meat.- No flare ups- Even grilling as a result of even surface temperature- Easy grill cleanup* because there are no flareupsHowever, after a while (1-3 years depending on how often and how much you grill) on going maintenance costs and other issues resulting from the nature of infrared grilling (gas heating up a perforated panel that heats up the grill).  These expensive and fiddly bits of maintenance to keep the grill running smoothly and performing as well as it should are:Cons:- Preferably after each use, the grill is cooled down and the perforated panel disassembled (screw driver needed here) for cleaning.  This is the panel that the gas below heats up which in turn evenly distributes heat up to the grill grate above.  It also catches all juices from the foods cooking above and is responsible for preventing flareups.  As such, the little holes tend to get clogged and gummed up and need to be cleaned frequently for optimal performance.- After a year or so, this perforated metal sheet needs to be replaced with a new one because one can only clean gummed up food-juices out of holes a certain number of times.  This is a major part and is also quite expensive.- It is this maintenance that eventually wears down all but the most devout of infrared grill users.  This is why there are so many infrared grills that are approximately 2 years old in the classifieds section online and in print.  Many people just give up because of the effort and cost of maintenance, some others just use it until the perforated part dies, sell the old one and buy a new one and start all over again.  Others sadly, think their grill died without realizing that a consumable part needed to be replaced by design to restore the grill to its original performance.Additional notes:As with all portable grills, this one has a single burner. As this grill is also infrared, the entire cooking surface is one constant even temperature. There are no hotspots.Once maintenance issues and costs of running an infrared grill are understood, this little unit is recommended as a high performance portable grill and also as an inexpensive introduction to infrared grilling."
79659,"This is the OEM cabin air filter for the 2006 Acura TL, and trust me: this thing does what it's supposed to do. I couldn't believe how much crud this thing had caught between the B12 service on my girlfriend's 2006 TL.One thing I will say is that this is a PITA to replace. After disconnecting the glove compartment door and removing the two screws and push fittings securing the assembly to the console, pull the console down. Directly down. That means sit in the passenger seat and apply equal force to both sides of the assembly... or you'll break a tab and your interior will never be the same. I've seen two people make the mistake of busting the tabs loose right to left. Don't be another."
79660,"Being a Pacific Northwest gardener, I have been waging a one-woman genocide on slugs for my entire adult life.  Either Corry's Slug & Snail Death or Deadline Slug and Snail Killer are my usual weapons of choice.  Both of these products seem to poison the slugs and leave visible evidence of their tortured death-a shiny trail of slug guts leading to the corpse of the vanquished pest.  I LIKE THAT.  Dr. T's Slug & Snail Killer is supposed to work by interfering with the digestive process of a slug so they are unable to continue eating.  Presumably they crawl away to slowly die in solitude.Since my yard is no longer criss-crossed with the telltale signs of Slug Armageddon, I can only judge this product's effectiveness by the condition of my plants.  I still see some damage to small flower seedlings that were surrounded by Dr T's when they were set out in the garden.  I will say however that for the FIRST TIME EVER my leaf lettuce does not look like Swiss cheese.I've never had a problem with my cats getting into the other slug bait I've used but Dr T's is non-toxic to pets if yours do. The product is a bit spendy for the square footage it covers and I can see some of the pellets remain uneaten & mouldering on the ground.  I plan to add this product to my arsenal for use in the vegetable garden but will keep the Deadline in my holster for its immediate carnage ""bang for the buck"" in the flower beds and lawn."
79661,Great show great characters great writing.  I think it is great so I wrote great  5 times.  Don't you think that is great?
79662,"I love the lore being done here, i hope to see him evolve into the green arrow super hero that we all know"
79663,Such a fun show for the kids to watch. It keeps them entertained and teaches them a few things too!
79664,What a wonderful and perfect show for the 50th anniversary celebration.  I actually found myself applauding at the end and then watching it again.  I can't even say how many times I've now watched it but I never get tired of it.
79665,"I was pleasantly surprised by how well this cruise assist works. No more hand cramps. Install is simple and the cramp buster works very well. I'm very satisfied with the performance, easy of use, and low cost. Great purchase."
79666,"This spark plug worked fine in my cheap Chinese scooter, a 250 cc by Shenko.  Exactly the same as I got at Autozone earlier."
79667,"The acting  is excellent.  Scene settings, time period and the conditions of life in that era are horrendous.  The stories were real-life and told in all its horryifying and heroic detail.  I loved both seasons and would strongly recommend watching."
79668,this item work great for trying to find an electrical short in the car wiring electrical harness and find bad connection
79669,this show keeps you on your toe's from start to finish. I can't wait to see the next season.  woooohoooo
79670,You must buy this if you buy a string trimmer. The string breaks often so you need extra refills of the proper width.
79671,"I will start by saying that if you have a warped sense of humor, this show is for you. It is not a show for the faint of heart. Sunny is a brutal and hysterical look at borderline personalities and the hilarity that ensues."
79672,I have long been a fan of British police dramas as well as the dry English wit (notwithstanding Monty Python & company).  The set period lends itself well to demonstrating the less than enthusiastic welcome to women in a male dominated profession.  Excellent acting by all.
79673,"The Tomcat spin trap design is meant to be a quick clean way to kill and dispose of mice. You set the trap with bait and wait for a mouse to crawl in the somewhat small opening and get killed when it goes for the bait. These traps will only work with small mice, and the kill mechanism is unreliable as some users have noted - sometimes mice will escape without triggering the trap and sometimes when it does strike them they don't die right away. The one main plus with these for squeamish folks is that when a mouse is caught you just throw the trap away with the mouse inside. Of course that means that you can only catch one mouse per trap and then you would need to buy new traps for the future, similar to the glue traps that are commonly sold. These are safer than other traps if you have kids around, but if you really want a reliable way of catching mice these are likely to disappoint. I have found in my experience with multiple types of rat/mouse traps that I like the electric traps the best for indoor use, and if you have a recurring issue those will end up being more economical in the long run since a single trap could be used for many years."
79674,"This device is designed to provide you plants with consistent water over a couple weeks, like when you go on vacation. Now the water reservoir is rather cheaply made. The lid does not close properly, I had to place a rock on it to keep it closed. Now if you look above, you can get the Hydrospikes by themselves and use almost any bottle or jug with them. This model works best when you don't have any place for that jug as it attaches to the side of the flower pot. You can also use multiple hydrospikes to one jug to water multiple plants or one large pot.Now the one thing to keep in mind is that you do need to ""prime the pump"" by soaking the terracotta sensor and pouring water into the hydrospike to get the water flowing. You may also need to do this occasionally if the water stops or runs out for any reason.If you have a lot of flower pots, are forgetful when it comes to watering and especially if you have a tendency to over water your plants, then this is a great tool for keeping your plants healthy and alive."
79675,"NCIS Season 9 - excited to get to this season, but still on season 6.  Love the DVDS - only wish all of them had the option to PLAY ALL episodes.  Some seasons do and some don't - I like to start the DVD and let it play through the 4 episodes without interruption....Great show and great cast."
79676,Great imaginative kids programming. It helps bring my kids down if they are too hyper before bed. They know it's time to calm down and let their imaginations take over when this show comes on.
79677,"Update on November 1st,2012: I am on my third bottle of Liquid Glass LG-100 & there is no going back to anything else for me at this point.  I even use this stuff on my windshield, it last longer than Rain-X while providing much better gliding action, rain just glide over the windshield. It's a nice feeling not having to use wipers.It's hard to write another review for an outstanding product with numerous positive feedbacks under its belt. But unlike most people I used Liquid Glass with a different approach. I used my Liquid Glass in conjunction with Blue Magic's TR3 which in my opinion is slightly more abrasive, which makes it a better scratch remover & a better glazing compound than the Liquid Glass which is a better paint sealer and/or protector.My entire detail process took 2 days. Day 1 was washing & claying followed by a thorough polishing job with Blue Magic's TR3. After the required 2 hrs cure for the TR3, Liquid Glass is applied with an orbital buffer that has Mequiar's W8006 polishing pad attached to it.Follow instructions & let the Liquid Glass ""bake"" in the sun with ambient temp above 70 degrees for a minimum 4 hrs.  I applied a second coat on Day 2 once the ambient reaches above 70, again let it bake for 4 hrs before applying 3rd coat.The end result is complete paint restoration that looks like no other wax job unlike anything I have ever seen. My 97 Chevy Dually now looks like a new truck with a brand new layer of clear coat paint over its once dull, faded paint.For as long as you are willing to invest the time by applying multiple coats & baking it for 4 hrs in between, you will never look back at ""any"" wax, paint sealer or polish etc out there. This is indeed the best there is, my search is over."
79678,"I was very happy to get and use the Sun Joe leaf mulcher. We raked most of our leaves to the curb, but didn't get the ones up in the very back of the yard. I dreaded trying to get them to the front curb, so this item arrived just at the right time.The Sun Joe does exactly what it promises to do. It mulches leaves so they are easier to dispose of or use as garden mulch. It's loud, but you wouldn't expect anything else. It's very easy to use. Just attach your bag or set it over a can and turn it on.It offers multiple settings, so you can get a fine or coarse grind, depending on what you plan to do with your mulch. I prefer the finer grind since it takes up less space and should decompose quicker. There is a setting for wet leaves, but I didn't have any wet leaves to try. I should have saved some for a rainy day, but we were having so much fun that we cleaned up the yard before we realized it! I also didn't have pine needles, so I couldn't test that setting. The leaves that I did mulch seemed to be of a consistent size and it really did do a good job at it.This isn't my first experience with a product of this type. I used to have a Flowtron Leaf Eater (LE-900) and loved it, but it finally bit the dust. The Sun Joe seems to as effective than the Flowtron. I prefer the base of the LE-900 since it pivots, although the collapsible legs of the Sun Joe also has advantages. Otherwise, they are about the same.This is the type of product I would recommend to any of my friends that need or want to simplify lawn care. This seems perfect for small to medium sized yards. It seems to be well made and it's easy to store. Overall, I'm very happy with it. I won't have to dread leaf-cleanup anymore!"

79680,"I really enjoy these guys(and their wives) and what they have to do to survive. Otto is my favorite, the man knows his animals, machines and how to build stuff. I want to know what planet Eve came from! The lady has an awesome work ethic for a young person and is constantly up to something in her garden, chickens, bees and goats -and always seems to be happy.Well done Kilchers!!"
79681,Season one repeated the English episodes but in season 2 they make the story their own. It really takes the characters into a different direction and they make the show their own.
79682,"It was like $6 and works great as a digging shovel. I can't complain at all! We use this all the time, hopefully it will work for years and years to come. And if it doesn't. it was only $6.  :)"
79683,Well made and it allows me to use a 20+ pound propane tank instead of small tanks that are expensive and wasteful. If I were to go camping I would use the small tanks but since the grill is used on my deck and permanently mounted there is no reason to use throwaway products.The hose fit perfectly and is well made so I couldn't be more pleased.
79684,"I've used K&N; filters in vehicles for many years.  Always with great results.  There's almost always a noticeable gain in performance and fuel mileage usually increases.  Cleaning is not a problem, just use their &#34;recharge&#34; kit to clean and oil the filter.I'm running this one in my 2012 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon.  Definitely can tell a difference in acceleration.  Fuel mileage on a recent trip was better by a couple of MPG as well."
79685,"I bought this dvd and 5 other seasons on the recommendation of my back doctor. So, far the first episode has been very dry and dull. The second episode picked up nicely. I am up to the fifth episode and still unsure about this show. At times, it's a series about a psychotic serial killer with morals. Other times, it's about a man who has no feelings but shows emotions like anger, frustration and fear. Oh, and there's the relationship between the main character and his damaged girlfriend. Who he feels is as damaged as he is. Now, I do hope these are not considered spoilers, as they are the central focus of the series it seems. There are more things going on in the series, such as his past relationship with his foster father, he relationship with his foster sister, his relationship with his coworkers etc. At this time, I can see the character developing into a very interesting but bizarre person. And of course the series will follow suit. We hope. After all, I have 6 seasons to watch. Can I recommend this series, sort of. I am not quite certain it is for everyone. It's growing on me though. So, I gave it three stars. Perhaps I should give it four, but time will tell.Ralph J. Fitcher."
79686,"Very enjoyable, enjoyed the acting, and the perspective on the Second World War from the English perspective. Not to mention crime solving without all the bells and whistles of the usual police shows."
79687,"This negative (One Star) review is due to Amazon's problem with their matrix for ""what part fits a particular vehicle"" - I would rate Mann Oil filter at FIVE Stars. I needed an Oil Filter (Mann) for a 2006 BMW 325 Ci Convertible. Amazon's fit guide steered me towards the Mann HU 816 - long story short, the HU 816 does NOT fit my vehicle.  I needed a Mann HU-925 (I had to go to a different web site for fit, and verification).  I still ordered the correct filter via Amazon because Amazon has the best price. One Star to Amazon's Vehicle Fit Guide, and Five Star for the Mann Filter."
79688,"I know it&#8217;s not traditional to review the first of a series after you&#8217;ve already reviewed the sequel...but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing with V/H/S.  About a month ago, I reviewed V/H/S/2, which I really enjoyed, partly because you don&#8217;t have to have seen the first one to know what&#8217;s going on.  Likewise, the first V/H/S is very entertaining and well done, however I have to confess that I do like the second one better.  But that should not dissuade you from checking this one out.  V/H/S is a ground-breaking horror film and it deserves a spot in every genre fan&#8217;s library!Just like it&#8217;s sequel, V/H/S is a non-traditional horror flick.  It is a compilation of short films, all shot from a first-person perspective, that all blend in with the main storyline.  The short films are not related, except that they are all smaller pieces to the bigger plot.  But again, this diversity is part of what makes the film so much fun.Unlike the second one, this film actually uses the main plot-line in a more terrifying fashion.  I will not go into great detail, but I will say that the main storyline is just as horrific as the individual shorts.  It even made me jump at one point, which is a true testament to the quality of any horror film.Probably my favorite short in V/H/S is the first one, titled &#8220;Amateur Night&#8221;.  In this film, three guys rent a hotel room with the hopes of bringing girls back for sex.  Their main focus is for the nerdier of their group, Clint, to score.  They outfit him with glasses that have a spy-cam attached so he can record his exploit.  Unfortunately, the girl he picks out is not quite what she seems, and the events that follow are like nothing you&#8217;ve ever seen before.But although I really liked V/H/S, I think I enjoyed the sequel more.  It feels like the production crew took things up several notches in the second one, including more intensity and even bigger scares.  However, I highly recommend this first film as a compliment to seeing the second one.  Both are definite Must Owns for your collection, and I suggest you check them both out soon.  They are available now in a variety of formats."
79689,"Once I leveled my camper, it was just a matter of peeling off the backing and attaching them to the camper in a level position.  They are great and very easy to use!"
79690,"I used this garden soil in my flower beds since I am not sure I want any nitrates in my vegetable garden yet.  It comes in the standard 1 cubic foot bag like other soils which helps it to stack well with the rest of my garden bags.  I followed the directions on the bag making a 3 inch layer of this garden soil and working it into the top 6 inches of my top soil.  The directions are slightly different for raised beds or for individual plants. But basically it ends up being a 50/50 mixed of this garden soil and your top soil.  I like that the nitrogen, phosphate, calcium and sulphate ingredients are coated which allows them to slowly release over time.  I think this may help them not to pollute the ground water and that makes it good for the environment. My flowers have already grown a noticeable 25% or more which has really helped to make my house look great.  Since they are still growing, by the time growing season is over I hope to get twice the growth like the bag says will happen..  I may need to adjust something in my soil preparation or watering.  I will keep experimenting.  But I am super pleased with the nice flowers I have now already.  I would recommend this soil for anyone wanting to more growth from their plants without trying to wade through the confusing world of fertilizers since the ratio of nutrients are already figured out for you in the bag."
79691,Love the writing for this show and the ideas they present.  A must see!! Definitely add to your watch list now.
79692,"Product was as described.  While tinting is comfortably dim, you can use this shield at night.  In the day, colors are still vibrant and clear.  You would expect them to take on a duller appearance but they don't; it's just like it makes a sunny day slightly overcast, with everything still being clear.  I wish it was a pinlock shield which my CL-16 came with on the clear model, and it works like a champ and is very clear (much better than Fog City inserts which are a little, umm, foggy).  The movement is smooth, up and down.  IF you aren't getting smooth movement, you have to check your alignment of the shield by gently bringing it all the way down and checking spacing; if the spacing is even slightly off, remove the shield and try again.  Five stars for price and visibility (and the fact that I already dumped my scooter and had some scratches on it and they mostly buffed right out)."
79693,"but so far, I'm enjoying the journey.  Surprisingly well acted by the main character and a few others, though in stark contrast with some others in the series.Part zombie, part scifi, part drama.  Interesting show."
79694,this is absolutely the best &#34;cop&#34; series i have ever watched even if it is an oder series.  thanks for offering it!
79695,They work like they are suppose to. They are mounted on a smitybilt  stinger front bumper. Package was great. No paint chips.
79696,"Peter Cameron's story SOMEDAY THIS PAIN WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU is coming of age tale that is, at turns, funny, sad, tender, and sophisticated. As adapted for the screen by director Roberto Faenza with Cameron and Dahlia Heyman this becomes an experimental film that will delight many and confuse some. The cast is excellent and once the audience moves into the rhythm of the narrated story it is difficult not to re-live youth and pull for the lad whose story this is.James Sveck (Toby Regbo) is a lonely young teenager who is tortured by his grossly unstable home environment and is fraught with hating people, suicidal thoughts, depression, and the preference for solitude.  It is the summer before he goes off to college at Brown University and he is conflicted: his vain lothario father (Peter Gallagher) insists that he go to college, his gallery owner mother (Marcia Gay Harden) has just returned form Las Vegas and her third failed marriage - this time to a compulsive gambler (Stephen Lang); his sister Gillian (Deborah Ann Woll) is writing her memoir and falling for an older married Polish professor; and James is working with his mother's gallery director (Gilbert Owuor), trying to make since of art, people, relationships and the chaos of the world that confuses him - the last thing he wants is to enter the college world. His mother lines him up with a Life Coach (Lucy Liu) and slowly James begins to come to grips with a past bad memory and to learn to accept who he is as someone worth living. James only loving connection to the world is his grandmother (Ellen Burstyn) and from her he learns a lot about the vagaries of life and how to cope. The story is told in the first person narration which helps give an intimate inside view of James as he works through his life at the therapy sessions which his parents insist he attend and it is in this manner that we learn about James's past and present through the stories he tells and his recounting of previous therapy sessions and the ambivalences and uncertainties of adolescence.The film manages to balance teenage angst and relationship failures with an equal amount of drama and comedy.  This is one of those films that linger in memory long after the final credits. Grady Harp, October 12"
79697,"I watched the movie free on Prime, doubt I would buy it.But, over all the movie isn't terrible,except for Foree, Klebe & Agnew the rest of the crew was eastern block citizens.Some acting was campy, who cares it's a fantasy movie.It's always nice to see a veteran actor like Ken Foree in a movie.Gotta love a zombie movie that take lines from other zombie movies to use.A good rainy day movie. Just don't take it serious."
79698,"Looks like it will do the job.  Closures on the hooks seem a bit flimsy, however.  Strapping looks plenty strong."
79699,"As a series that honors its origins without ever being merely imitative of them, this may well turn out to be one of the all time great television spin-offs. Indeed, the very term ""spin-off"" seems somehow inadequate. For this is a true sequel, and one fully up to the task of standing on equal terms with its predecessor.A lifetime has passed between the ending of Avatar and the beginning of Korra, and in that time the world of the four nations has moved on. Even during the scope of the original series, we saw that world in a state of technological ferment. In the time between the two series, this process has clearly marched on unabated. By the time Korra begins, we find ourselves in a world with technology comparable to early 20th century Earth.To those who fell in love with the world of the first series, I'd say only this: don't worry, for there is nothing to fear here. The  writers have not destroyed or replaced their original creation. Rather, they have profoundly deepened it. There is the sense of a real world with its own internal logic and course of development - a world that changes precisely because of its own reality. Integral to this is the fact that it's not just the technology that has moved forwards. Everything from the society's economic basis to its martial arts has changed since last we were here, but always in logical and internally consistent ways. You can tell that this is a show made by people with a deep respect for the integrity of their own creation.As with the original series, this logical and consistent quality - this ability to just plain think things through - applies not only to the world-building, but also to the plot and story. At all times we have the sense of a tapestry being woven. Even when we don't quite know where all the threads are heading, or what dark warp in the weave is yet to surface, we  instinctively know that _something_ is happening. Something we can't help but get caught up in and want to follow.Fittingly for an animated show, the world, the story, and all its many moods are communicated to us in large part through the art. At all times we know we're in the same world we were first introduced to in the original Avatar series. There are no sharp breaks here. However, in keeping with the early 20th century feel of this new era, the coloring is significantly more subdued. On a concrete level this manifests in such details as the sepia hues of early photography and the drabness of industrial landscapes. But it is also used to convey the sense that the world we are visiting is now a murkier place, one where the true nature of the threats faced is significantly less clear than it was in the original series. It is a tempting if imperfect metaphor to cast this show asThe Empire Strikes Backof the Avatar universe.I also find that I cannot let this review go by without mentioning the background music. As with the original series, this is composed by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, and is once again superb. It is both beautiful in its own right and integral to how the show's creators communicate with us as an audience. It speaks to us of the nature of the world we find ourselves in, of the story we are following, and again, of all the many moods that this story takes. And it not only speaks: it speaks eloquently.There is so much more to say here, but I'm going to cut myself down to two final observations.First, Andrea Romano, whom I shall forever think of asHawkgirl, lends her considerable talents to the voice direction. One never knows quite how much credit should go to a director and how much to the actors. But when everyone just plays off each other perfectly, you've got to figure that a significant slice of the credit should go to the director. Props to you, Andrea.Second, one of the things I've loved the most about this series is how, in the character of Avatar Korra, we do have the sense that at the core, this is the same person we were first introduced to as Avatar Aang: even though that person is now manifesting through a very different personality.This is far and away the best thing Nickelodeon has done in years. It is the kind of show that both children and adults can enjoy. But unlike so many shows that wind up being described in such terms, it is not ""multi-layered"" in the straightforward sense that there are some things that the less sophisticated viewers will miss entirely. Rather, its generation-spanning appeal stems from far more basic strengths: a well thought out story, real emotional depth, and compelling characters; to say nothing of meticulous world-building coupled with wonderfully lyrical art and background music.That, in the end, is why both children and adults will love The Legend of Korra.Theo."
79700,Not sure whats quite going on. Its kind of like Lost in the fact that it makes you want to watch more.
79701,"These guys are hilarious, all trying to be the ""cool"" teacher.  This show makes me feel optimistic and pessimistic at the same time.  I love the portrayal of high school kids today, it is pretty spot on.  The exchange with the principal and his secretary was hilarious.  And their quest to find drugs to plant on a student was great.  Tons of potential."
79702,I did not like this show too much when it first came out.  This has quickly changed after jumping in for Season 3.  So much that I had to go back and watch the first 2 seasons on Netflix because I couldn't settle with just 1 episode a week.
79703,This is an awesome product for cloning your favorite plants.Ip use this with the solution as well.Simple ta use and some quick rooting.I recommend that ya use a heating pad of some sort ta make the tap roots form faster.
79704,"Very happy with the performance so far, but I have not been using it very long so cannot speak to the long term protection capabilities, but compared to other protectants it yields a nicer less oily and less glossy surface (I consider this to be a good thing). Just be warned that it should be wiped off immediately, this is clearly stated on the packaging, but I failed to read it on first use. I think the spray bottle is much more cost effective, but the convenience of the wipes is nice. If you do not use it for a long time however, the top wipe gets a bit dried out and pulling out these wipes at the very beginning is not so easy. These use factors are the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5."
79705,"I give this five stars because not only is this series funny, but it is insightful into the nature of governments and bureaucracies.  While this show is poking fun at the British government, it would be easy to envision something quite similar in Washington."
79706,"The plot, characters, and overall production are well done.  Having the main characters being outlaws with some moral code is always an interesting prospective but it works for this season.  Definitely worth watching."
79707,"Great towel, it makes the job, great absorption, easy to wring. I decide to whas them by hand because I want to use them for long time :)"
79708,"This went together in 45 minutes so not too bad. I just used it today and it was ok but nothing special and you need to go over the same area 3 times to get it tilled good at just 3 inches deep and that was after I had it tilled up already 5 weeks ago so not really hard, hard ground. It needs more weight up front than the container can hold to help it dig down and you need to go quite slow. I put sand in the plastic holder on top to get the most weight I could in it. But for someone like me with a weak back and hands it is easy to handle and nice that it's electric so you don't have to worry about running out of gas. The tines can easily be removed by pulling the pin out for the single width but you still need the full space for width to go down the rows because of the wheels so I see no need to remove either set of tines. As a tiller to keep up with your garden after the initial heavy duty tilling this will be great but I'm not sure I'd get it done if it were the first till of the season after the ground has hardened from the long winter, it just doesn't have enough weight or horse power for that."
79709,"Sophisticated story-telling, encompassing several subjects, their lives, and circumstances is not an easy cinematic feat to accomplish inside of 120 minutes, though ""360"" manages in smooth, easy, dramatic fashion.Serendipity, and Irony intermixed with a bit of mystery, panache, and sex in the hands of a skilled Director, and an All-Star Cast of A-List professional Thespians produces texture woven of soft, and hard tones, controversial lifestyles, haunting issues, near misses, and casual suspense to provide a measure of meaningful entertainment, that will make you think while you're watching it...  --GBJ"
79710,"This is a great accompanying piece to the other Strathwood Griffen pieces. It is larger than it looks and is a great looking ottoman. The one issue is that it is rather tall so you're legs are almost vertical when in the Griffen chairs. It's not that big of a deal though, but in case you are thinking it is smaller than it is just realize the picture of it alone is not a good estimate. You can see the height in the other photos.So it really works well as either a foot rest or as a place to deposit a tray. The cushion is actually pretty flat and sturdy. Only problem is that it doesn't attach to the base. So it does slip a bit.It's well built and solid though, and that is a nice comfort. The legs were all even. The weave is very natural looking. The cushion has a removable cover and is washable.It's a nice piece. But it is pretty spendy. And it arrived in a box with several Chinese freight stickers. So I'm assuming made in China."
79711,"I most recently have been usingOrb-3 Y240-000-1G Spa Enzymes Jug, 1-Gallonbut saw this and wanted to see if it was basically the same product with a different number since it says it's for pools on the label. And it seems to work the same! But it needs to be used in smaller amount based on the number of gallons in whatever it is you're filling. My spa has about 600 gallons and the ratio is based on 1000 gallons so I use a little more than half of the recommended amount.I've had my hot tub for years and getting the right chemical balance and clean, clear, nice-smelling water can often be a puzzle. The key is having the right combination of products and using them consistently. I think it's also important to change the water and filter regularly, and also to try to limit the amount of contamination the water gets from users who wear lotion, oils, perfumes, bug repellants or whatever into the spa -- along with a suit that may have been washed using soap.That said, I've found this liquid enzyme product to be very effective in controlling organic deposits and in making the water odor free and clear. I add about a capful of the liquid in my hot tub along with my brominating tablets and Renew 2.2 lb Leisure Time Spa each week. I sometimes add a little extra of the spa enzymes after I've had a large party of guests. I maintain the water temperature at around 100-104F as the product is designed to use in warmer water. I keep my spa open and use it all year long and it seems to make my other sanitizing agents work more efficiently to maintain a good chemical balance. I also like that you can use the spa immediately and that you don't have to circulate the water for long periods after adding in order for it to work. It does not cause skin irritation or dryness. I've noticed less scum along the walls of the tub as well! I'm all about less maintenance and am quite pleased to recommend this item."
79712,i found the movie entertaining.  My knowledge of the relationship between Liz Taylor and Richard Burton was very limited. I enjoyed watching the movie and seeing how they got together and what an unique relationship it was. A must for Taylor and Burton fans.
79713,"I have had many different kinds of hummingbird feeders through the years.  Most of them were the kind where you unscrew the glass or plastic bottle and turn it upside down to fill.  The fill hole on them was small, so I had to use a funnel to pour in the sugar and water.  This hummingbird feeder works fine for me.  I like how you can unscrew the top without taking the rest of the feeder apart to fill it.  It's a nice, wide opening, so it's easy to pour in the nectar.  And it's also much easier to clean out the inside of the bottle as well.The push/pull and open/close part is so you can fill it from the top so that the nectar will not pour out through the holes in the bottom.  Once the top is screwed back on, you pull the bottle up to let the nectar flow down and create a vacuum in the bottle (so it all doesn't just pour out through the holes).  It doesn't leak if the bottom halves are screwed tight, and the hummingbirds certainly don't care how it gets filled.Make sure you clean the feeder and change the nectar about once a week in hot weather.  The nectar will ferment, which is not good for the birds."
79714,"I was tired of my RV batteries not correctly maintaining charge. Had used other ""Bargain Brand"" chargers with poor results. Seems to be working fine. I use it to maintain two 6 volt batteries wired in series. I am monitoring the price of this item and plan to buy another if and when the price drops. (Easy to do if you leave one in your Amazon Cart.Steve"
79715,"Changed the oil on my own for the first time today.  Last person who changed my oil didn't have this wrench and couldn't remove it no matter how hard he turned it.  This is a must have if you're doing it yourself.  So simple to remove!  Nice snug fit but not tight, which is what you want.  After using it, you probably won't be able to remove by hand.  Wiggle it gently back and forth and it will come loose just fine."
79716,"This is the first season of NYPD Blue that you can watch in widescreen HD.  It is phenomenal to see such a fantastic show in wondrous WS/HD.  This season is set just post-9/11, and 9/11 was addressed tangentially but doesn't really drive the stories or anything.  This season brings Danny Sorenson's replacement, John Clark.  So, the kid from Silver Spoons (who I thought was great) is replaced by the kid from Saved by the Bell.  Mark-Paul Gosselaar is excellent and hits the ground running, making a fine addition to the show in the wake of Rick Schroder's departure.  One of his character's first interactions with Sipowicz is to say he thought Sipowicz was acting like a d*ck.  He's holding his own in Sipowicz's world, and the whole show is really firing on all cylinders--even though at this point the only regulars left are perhaps just Sipowicz and Medvoy.  The growing relationship between Sipowicz and McDowell is better fleshed out that I had remembered.  At times, Charlotte Ross's character's pain is quite moving, and you can better see where and why things are headed with the two of them than I realized on my first time through this show (which, admittedly, was over a decade ago, and I was an inconsistent viewer at best at that time just due to being busy).  They just don't make TV this good anymore.  Watch a couple episodes of NYPD in it's NINTH season (when it should, by all accounts, be as stale and paint-by-numbers as it could get) and then watch [insert any cop/detective drama on network television in the past 5 years] and you'll see what I mean.  But do yourself a favor--if you haven't ever watched NYPD Blue, start at the beginning (square, SD picture and all) and work your way through the whole show from the start.  It is a moving, wild ride that will not let you down.  It is amazing that this show is still so good in its ninth season and that there are three seasons after this one to still experience!  Can't beat NYPD Blue!"
79717,bought these for my k2500 suburban plenty of length front to rear. i ended up using them right out of the box as i for a dead battery in my truck. they worked great. several people have complained about the clamps. they worked well for me and i had no issues with poor connections. cables are well made.
79718,"It's worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these. It sure beats fixing a cracked neck, headstock, or guitar body after a guitar slips off the strap pins and falls for a great height!"
79719,"I was skeptical about using these 100 lb shocks in my RV when I first got them since I couldn't compress them no matter what I did.  However, I needed new struts to lift the platform that half our memory foam bed was on, so I installed them and boy do they work great!  They not only lift half of my bed up, but these struts keep the bed up so I can easily get stuff stored in the compartment under the bed.  My wife really likes using them.  However, these struts were so strong I had trouble keeping the bed completely down.  The platform wanted to raise up a few inches.  I fixed that with a couple of magnetic latches - a small price to pay for such super lifters."
79720,love this show. too bad this is the last season. love watching it anytime I want too. I love it
79721,"I am a huge fan of ""Elementary"", starring Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu.  The writing always keeps me guessing, and I love the chemistry between Holmes and Watson.  I have purchased every episode through Amazon Instant Video so that I can enjoy the show on my own schedule and without commercials.  I am rating the show with 5 stars; however, I am disappointed with Amazon right now because episodes 23 and 24 are still not available.  PLEASE hurry and upload the finale Amazon.  Excellent show!"
79722,"There are so many similar Tomcat items that it is confusing what differentiates them. This Tier 1 station is primarily distinguished by its ability to be refilled rather than tossed after one use. Like the disposable ones, it is designed with a little tunnel, so kids and pets can't easily get to the poison inside. It is excellent in that regard and not dangerous to have in an area where people are walking by. I am very happy with them so far."
79723,They keep the contacts clean and lubricated however they are both the same and not a matched pair for vehicle and trailer.

79725,"OK, I'm a light nut. I fabricate my own LED light painting tools, room lights - even friends ask me to create lights for their daughter's doll houses. I have spools of LED lights on hand, and every part to make them work. So why exactly would I order this? As I said, I'm a light nut and I'm curious.  I swear that there are only a couple of factories in the world churning out parts for LED's.  The controller, remote, connectors - these are the same generic ones I have in my parts bins.  So why pay a premium price for this kit? 1) You have a warranty and it ships from the USA. 2) No soldering (and those four tabs are mighty close!), 3) it's ready to go.All the connectors are already soldered in place, you have all the wires and parts you'll need. No guessing n voltage, connectors, compatibility and the like.  Plus the LED strips are black, not white, so they blend in.  If you've ever used self-adhesive LED strips, you know the adhesive is questionable. It works great or it falls off. The LED strips included in this kit use 3M VHB tape. VHB has been voted one of the top 20 inventions of the past 10 years. The stuff bonds to almost anything and stays in place. This is the only LED strip I've seen to use VHB. VHB does take some pressure to adhere, and it increases it's bond over 72 hours. The surface has to be clean, free of waxes and grease, and dry.You can plug this right in to any car outlet. I still call them lighter sockets.  Now, these LED's run on 12 volts.  So if you're handy, you can cut the cable from the car adapter and wire it up directly.  The controller module also contains the sensor for the remote control, and this needs to be line of sight to the remote.  You have about 6 inches of wire to play with, so you can hide the controller and just leave the wire exposed.  The controller attaches with a screw or two sided tape (a square of tape is included). There's also a small strip of two sided tape included.  These are not VHB tape. You'll also need a way to secure the wires. 3M makes some command hooks in clear plastic designed for small wires.  Alternately, if the LED's are out of sight, you can just tie-wrap everything in place (but you'll still need a way to secure the end of the wire with the remote sensor.)You can install this in as little as 30 minutes, or, if you want to hide everything, an hour or so."
79726,"I installed it in my RV bathroom after the Ventline exhaust fan lost the fan blades, became brittle. I had to move the gear hole as per modification instructions. The hardest part for me was to line up the gear for the cover to the vortex gear hole then line up the two screw holes that holds up the  vortex. I thought the crank on the ventline was easier to install and makes opening and closing the cover faster.It took me over an hour to install this instead of the 15 minutes that I read somewhere here. The fan works well only needs house battery power."
79727,"Thanks to the fortuitous and copious internal documentation of this particular cult we get a sneak peek into what it was like in the day. Seems like lots of hippies were lost and wandering after the 60's ended and looking for something to guide them and thus we ended up with these cult figures who filled the vacuum of meaning. It will happen again, one day."
79728,If you play 12 acoustic you gotta get this one.  Just a hair longer on the padded area which is what  you need.  You can tell them from the 6 string version by the ridges being much closer together on this one.
79729,This is a fairly standard good guy v. bad guy movie.  The characters were interesting.  I think this movie could be made and would be a worthwhile view..  It's success would depend upon good live actor casing.
79730,"Works great, I needed this to start impatiens seeds from Burpee -- they're so small they resemble grains of sand, you actually dip a toothpick in water and use the surface tension to pick up and deposit each seed -- THAT'S SMALL. Keep the transparent lid on until the seeds have mostly sprouted, then remove the lid and slowly ""harden off"" the plants by exposing them to the outdoors and eventually sunlight over time.I wish I'd ordered two or more of these. It's much, much cheaper to start flowers from seed on your own versus buying them at the local Home Depot or nursery. I already ordered more impatiens and I have some vincas I want to get started for the warmer months. Buy some decent potting mix or seed starting mix, or if you're really crunchy granola run some garden soil through your oven @ about 350 degrees for an hour to sterilize it. I like to add some perlite to soil mixes. I also like to water the soil BEFORE THE SEEDS ARE SOWN with Miracle Gro. The transparent dome will maintain humidity while the seeds are sprouting. I'd use a decent plant mister (Couldn't insert product link, URL is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010H748S/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details) to keep the seedlings content.Great product. I really wish I'd ordered two or three of them."
79731,"great stories, amazing acting, interesting characters, and although the plot goes all over the place it is such an interesting season, which makes it well worth the craziness and confusion that is typical of this series thus far."
79732,"I  like this model for simple use, the hard part was getting the sight pictucte set up without the helmet in the frame, the laser points are helpful, not in daylight in the feild, I have two of these  and my wife managed to lose bury my first one  so i havent had a chance to try the water housing, Not sure what class of card to get , the gopro HD2 requires class 10 mem cards, does anyone know if this is benifit this contour,. The right left half mounts , well i was  scared to mount them so i waited a full day for adhesive to set. Not much infor on this part."
79733,"this has been a great addition to my garage. I use it on everything ... car, motorcycle, bike, balls etc."
79734,"I've only used it once, so I can't speak to the brush's longevity, however, it worked like a charm on my grill this past weekend.  It was easy to fill with water, simple to use, the handle is long enough to reach to the back of my huge BBQ without burning all of the hair off of my arms, and it really did steam the gunk off of the grill.  I hope it lasts!"
79735,"The unit we received is actually labeled as a Soliport ELM 327 Bluetooth OBDII OBD2 Diagnostic Scanner, ELM327 wireless OBD 2 Scan tool check Engine Light CAR CODE READER, not a Elandpower. I am guessing that these are ""generic"" devices manufactured in the same factory and just labeled with different seller's stickers.That being said, the device we received works better than I expected and performs all of the functions that the scanner should be able to do on my 2009 Chrysler Town and Country mini-van. I did not use the software on the mini-CD and could not really find anything useful on the disc. I am using the paid version of the ""Torque"" application for my HTC EVO (Android) and have not experienced any issues with slow response or drop-outs over Bluetooth (connection pairing code ""1234"").Recommended for the device functionality, but your experience may vary based on the device you actually receive and the application you choose to use as a monitor.CFH"
79736,"I am very happy with this hose holder. The lid was a pleasant surprise. I do not have to worry about emptying the holder when it rains. Secondly, I was impressed with the weight and diameter of the holder. It does not tip over easy and is very sturdy. It holds a 20' hose with no issues with the hose becoming tangled with the cone center. The copper color is nice without drawing too much attention to itself."
79737,"These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear, this is not a standalone product, they are designed to be used in the ""Fly Web Fly Trap"".The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit. This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the ""Fly Web Fly Trap"" verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips, Fly Catcher Trap, Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack, with the old fashion but very ugly Flay Paper Strips winning hands down.Recommended, if you own theFly Web Fly TrapCFH"
79738,Good Item for the price.  You may have to bend the mounting bracket slightly. Be careful and make sure both sides of the bracket bend evenly or you will not get the bolt through into the footpeg.
79739,"This was an odd movie, off beat to say the least, but it hooked you in so that you wanted to see what was finally going to happen, as Muriel's character developed.  The ending was worth the wait"
79740,"I recently ordered several live traps because the reviews on all were mixed.  The Kness Tip Trap has worked for us.  Don't remember which ones I ordered, but it appears I never received this one."
79741,"Big grill, high btu's, took me ~2 hours to assemble with 3 elementary school age helpers and the neighbors cat getting in the middle of it.  Could probably put it together in 30-40 minutes but the directions are a bit vague at times.  For example, some parts are helpfully labeled &#34;this side inward&#34;, but &#34;inward&#34; is sort of up for interpretation.  Some bolts are different size in what you get vs the directions.  I have one long bolt with a wingnut on it leftover but nothing in the instructions seems to call for that.As others have mentioned, you'll have a hard time turning the gas bottle off until the grill cools.  The knob is about 1.5&#34; below the drip pan, which gets hot along with the grill.  No idea why people are reporting problems getting the gas bottle to fit, mine drops right in.  One igniter had no spark until I tweaked the distance between the tip and the burner, then all 3 worked fine.Haven't cooked in it yet.  I'll report back if its good or not and if I have any problems with it at all.  If you see no reports of problems, I didn't have any!  Heated up to &#62;600 in a few minutes, runs around 450 with all 3 burners on low.  I like the 'stacks' because you could cover one with an empty can or piece of foil to increase the heat retention inside (meaning one burner on low would give you some decent low and slow) and it looks like you could remove a portion of the right side of the lower casement and probably add on an indirect or smoker box to the side.It does have a lot of gummy machine oil all over it.  I let it run to max temp for about 15 minutes, then low for 15 minutes, then shut it off.  I'll check tomorrow when its cool but that should have burned it off and helped 'set' the paint on it.  A high heat/off cycle like that heats the paint and then lets it 'stick' better, so there is less flaking or discoloration down the line.  Whole thing is matte black, so any black grill paint will dress up rust or scrapes.  Had a bunch of very minor scrapes and dings from the shipping process, its not really packed very well and lots of the parts are VERY close to the sides of the boxes, so if your box is bashed badly you might consider returning it instead of unpacking it, because you have about zero chance of getting all this back in the box once its unpacked.  Paid about $160 for it, can't really get anything this nice at that price point unless you're lucky enough to grab a clearance item at a B&M; store.  Good luck with that."
79742,"The instructions for this hummingbird feeder were vague, so I'm so glad that some of the other reviewers pointed out the important things, like filling this up completely to create a vacuum and keeping it level. I had initially only filled it half-way and ended up sadly watching all of the nectar leak out as I sat in my office waiting for the hummingbirds to come. It still leaks a little bit since it's hard to keep it level when it's hanging, but I finally have hummingbirds which my daughter and cat really enjoy watching."
79743,"This isn't the easiest tool to use in tight spots, and it's not particularly easy to read, but it gets the job done."
79744,"Used on a 23' sailboat.  I have the PV panel laid our on the forward desk, so had need of an extension (this is while the boat is on its trailer between sailing times). Easy connection and use."
79745,"These are nice, I like the 1.14 rigidity and these are just fine for me... you will wear them out on acoustics though if you are a more aggressive player as I am.  Once these are worn, as with most picks, they sound considerably different.  Much more grainy and tin-y but that may be a plus for you?  I also like the side edges for a real mellow and / or speeding picking style.  They stay in your fingers well."
79746,Been watching this show since the first series and it has only gotten more and more interesting with the development of the characters and the changes in circumstances they face. Series one started a little slow and focused more on Grimm's Fairytales link and now that link is only referenced in the opening sequence which is a shame but it also means they have more freedom to do what they want with the story.Looking forward to seeing what is coming next.
79747,"Now that CA has passed the Growler Labeling Act (or something like that), you can now get any growler (as long as there's tape over any labels) filled at a brewery.  I know that other states have adopted this long ago, but its big news for CA residents.  I got one of these to bring to local breweries and tote around homebrew, and it works amazing.  Beer stays cold for a LONG TIME!"
79748,"And hasn't GOTTEN to -20 below! It's the end of January here in CT and we've had several nights of 0 to 15 below (including wind chill). I just went out to check on the birdbath and it's iced up solid as a rock. There isn't even any remote warmth towards the top of the &#34;De-Icer&#34;. I gave it a four star because I truly like this thing! It's worked through anything above 0 up until this point. I'm really not sure that anything 50 watts would go to -20, but I figured in this part of New England, I wouldn't have to worry. I'm hoping it's not broken at all, but I'll have to wait and see if it does its job when it gets a little warmer (like in the teens or twenties).Again, four stars, because it was totally worth it up to this point and we don't get this bitter cold weather here very often (or for very long periods of time). I just thought it should be mentioned so prospective buyers would be aware:)"
79749,This 12 power outlet is well constructed and does the job quite well. I could have bought a fancy chrome plated one for well over a hundred dollars but this one does the same job at a fraction of the cost. It's good to know that some bargains still exist.
79750,"This film starts with an eerie and inventive premise. It leaves a more haunting, memorable trail than most movies in the genre. But in between its first and its lasting impressions, it somewhat loses its way in the dark.Too much goes unexplained. For example, we see John Leguizamo stranded in his darkened movie theater one minute - then we next see him lying battered and bruised in an illuminated bus stop shelter. What happened to get him there? In his commentary, Director Anderson says that there was some scripting that would have explained Leguizamo's trajectory, but a variety of constraints prevented this explanation from becoming part of the film. Actually, Anderson thought this was all to the good though - that some things were best left to the imagination. I'm not so sure about that. It seems Leguizamo's navigation of the engulfing, vanquishing night would have been one of the processes most interesting to watch. Without showing such process, the film too often ends up being just abrupt, choppy, and undeveloped.It also has too many lapses of logic. The creeping darkness doesn't play fair. It shifts its rules of engagement, overwhelming one person, while allowing another similarly situated person to survive, at least for a while. Well, that could be an additional aspect of the evil of the darkness. It toys randomly with its victims, like a cat may or may not toy with a mouse, sheerly on a whim.Then I had one of my common technical complaints about this film. The DVD often projected as an indecipherable smudge on my TV screen. So it ran as murky rather than sinisterly dark. There is something about the final lighting/filtering process that many modern filmmakers use that causes their movies to be a chore to watch on home TV's. I wish filmmakers would get back to whatever technology was used from the 1920's through the 1960's that allows their films to play as appropriately shaded rather than just obscure when run on a TV screen.The Director's commentary doesn't add a lot to a viewer's appreciation of the film. Brad Anderson starts out sounding too much like Ben Stein, making a dreary, nasal drone of his narrative. So unless you have a lot of spare time, you can probably skip the commentary and most of the other extras, except for the interviews.However the Director's commentary does highlight at least one telling aspect of this film and its making. Anderson talks about how apt it was to settle on Detroit as a location for the action. The City itself is perhaps the most fascinating character in the entire movie. It becomes an icon of our crumbling economy, our crumbling culture. Some of the scenes in the movie call for shots of major urban intersections shown desolate, abandoned, post-apocalyptic. Anderson said that he hardly had to clear Detroit's streets and highways of cars and people for these scenes. They are already so often eerily null. So many buildings are already hollow, echoing shells of once vital industries. These shots in and of themselves served as chilling prognostications of what can in reality befall all our cheery, oblivious bustle.So this movie is overall worth watching - for its darkling premise, and for its stunning views of Detroit."
79751,"I needed a trowel that was non metallic for digging in dirt when treasure hunting.  As long as you're not digging in extremely hard dirt, this works just fine.  I don't use it for anything other than this so can't comment for gardening use but I'd say it probably would work just fine."
79752,"Scandal is addictive.  I'm not sure if I enjoy the plots or the ensemble having so much fun with those same plots.  This is a rare case where the ensemble is everything.  The series is so well cast, that you are intrigued with them and can't wait to find out what else is in store for them.The plots are well crafted, and by far one of the best television series on the air."
79753,"I purchased this cover for last December for my 2007 Chrysler 300C. I used it to cover my car in the garage just to keep off the dust and dirt. I just finished putting it on for a second season and it's still in perfect condition. It fits perfectly and is very easy to install. The elastic band is still in good shape and holds the cover very securely without the need to tie it down. It does come with eye holes for the purpose which I don't use, that I'm sure would be useful if used outdoors. I put a blanket over the hood just for a little more protection from something being dropped, but it's plenty thick to prevent minor scratches and scuffs.Like I said I use it inside so I can't speak to how it would repel water but frankly I'd probably buy a more expensive cover if I were keeping it outdoors.For the price this cover works very well and I can recommend it highly if your using it under the same conditions."
79754,"i think of this kind of thing as similar to SPINAL TAP, which was a mockumentary of a documentary on rock stars.  This is a mock version of a soap opera like tv miniseries.  If you like this kind of thing, it will be five stars for you.  if you can handle this only a great once and awhile, like i can, then it will be less. I guess more apt would be the mock soap opera from decades ago called SOAP. For the first year or two that satire was out of this world. What mainly sustained me though was the late Robert Mulligan as one of the players. This is also similar to the spoof on SNL about the &#34;Californians&#34; which is also ok every once in awhile.  It is not that I cannot see the talent in this.  I can but I just personally can't make it through all these episodes of a satire of a family saga. this review is written primarily for others like me, who can see the talent in it but it just isn't their kind of entertainment. SPINAL TAP and SOAP were about it for me in this genre of entertainment."
79755,"This is a great birdfeeder, and different than the usual ones from the hardware store.The capacity is big -- maybe a gallon of bird seed.  The double chamber -- I thought it was a gimmick -- is actually pretty cool.  It does work the way it says... twice the feeding spots.The filling mechanism works very easily; can be done with one hand.  Push in the button on the top, slide open the lid, and it stays (pour in the seed) and then push the button back in to slide the lid back down.It looks nice too -- looks like glass and metal, not plastic and plastic.I received this as a gift.  After a week of use, my spouse said, ""Hey that bird feeder is great -- get another one of those like that!""Strongly recommend. I bought another one on amazon."
79756,"The characters seem more &#34;real&#34; in this homicide detective story which is told in serial for the entire season.  I don't usually like serial stories because it leaves too much unfinished.  However, when watching it on Amazon, it is more like watching a really long movie and it allows for the individual characters to be more fleshed out.  It is also more dimensional than some murder mysteries get, letting you see the lives of each suspect."
79757,This season is excellent.  Lots of twists. Looking forward to the mid season finale.  It suggests Annie dies but we know that can't be true.  Sure hope they don't leave the mid season with that hanging in the air.
79758,"We LOVE Shaun the sheep! Just good clean fun, with humor that hits at multiple levels, so it's fun for adults too."
79759,"behringer may be cheap, but they do create some good products, for this one it's a hit and miss. although i ordered three of them."
79760,"Use this on a moderate grade when I had to jack the car up, worked well and kept the vehicle secure while I did a little work."
79761,"Season five has fulfilled a lot of expectations  I had from the beginning.  While not tying everything in a neat package in the end, this one has loose ends.  Not enough to turn off those who stuck with the program for five seasons.  Rodney McKay, John Shepard and the rest, don't meet a terrible demise.  The show ends on a positive note. The evil Wraith, while not entirely finished, won't be bothering earth for some time.I recommend the program because it follows the tradition of SG-1 with a set of likable characters.  Woolsey, portrayed by Robert Picardo (of Star Trek Voyager ) does an incredible job as station captain.  It was good to see Colm Meany and the actor that portrayed the chief engineer on Enterprise in other roles.  I was glad to see Nicholas Pellegi (from the X-Files) in the role of a starship captain last all five seasons!What impressed me about this saga was the quality of the writing.  If only this studio was in charge of the Star Trek franchise!  They seem to be delivering much more in terms of action and dramatic possibilities.  There was more adventure in five years of Stargate: Atlantis than in seven years of Star Trek: Voyager.  The writers were fans of Star Trek and it shows in the writing.I wonder if they had to get permission from Paramount to use the beam up gimmick Trek utilizes so frequently? This show leaves open the possibility of a sequel or future films.  The last episode in paticular shows the fans there will be more in the future."

I have used them both, the spray, and the liquid and the spray is the way to go for these. If you do have the older all foam style filters then get the liquid (squirt/pour kit or bottle) it will last you longer."

79766,"I though what a great idea, blow air into lines and clear them so they wont freeze right? Well I wondered about the low lines or the dips throughout the coach the pex may have in hidden areas if water didn't get totally blow out and accumulate in these areas. Well this past fall I blew the lines good with air and my good air compressor to the right pressure no to over do what the lines can hold and long and a few times.Well with the super cold winter we had I got nervous after a few super cold days in Dec and figured I would pump rv antifreeze through all the lines which I have always done just in case my fears were right. Well it would not pump through all the water lines because the accumulated water left in pex lines were frozen in some areas. I warmed up coach for a few hours and used a few space heaters till lines became unfrozen. Then the water pump finally drew in the antifreeze and I had no leaks and felt good the rest of the winter knowing the lines were protected.A thought also went through my mind when I was pushing compressed air in from my compressor to my water lines thinking how clean is this air that blowing through the air lines and compressor into my fresh water drinking lines?So the product does what its designed to do convert air to screw in part of water inlet after that I am not sure it gets all the water out. Plus just knowing the rv antifreeze is in all the lines is a safe thing to know your really covered good when you flush it in the spring and have no surprising leaks anywhere from a cracked pex line or connector somewhere"

79768,"I purchased 6 of these for a backup system for my home. Two Northern units and 4 Sunforce units all 15 watt. ( these are the exact same units btw, northern's are cheaper). With two inverters, a 2500 watt, and a 300 watt pure sinewave for computers and such. Hooked through a 7 amp charge controller to a pair of 110 amp hour deep cells in parallel for a total of 220 amp hr's.I first hooked two panels up to see how they did, they worked well in very low light but couldn't ever get the batteries to ""full"" on the controller. I then hooked up a third panel and that gave enough to bring the batteries to full after a full day. With six panels hooked up, it will bring the batteries to ""full"" in a very few hours from a 30% drained condition.These units are less then optimally placed and rarely get full sun, but do very well even without that. Two panels in full sun may very well have been able to bring the batteries to ""full"" but location is a problem for me. One other product of note is the P3 international ""Kill A Watt"" electrical useage meter. Doing a survey of electrical useage in my house to get ready for this project was an eye opener to say the least.Great panels, at a good price, that do what you pay for...all you can ask for."
79769,"First let me state that I firmly believe an electric lawn mower is one of the best things you can buy. A typical gas mower is more polluting than 11 cars. And in addition to the environment that pollution is going straight into you. Would you want to be right behind the exhaust from 11 cars for as long as it take to mow your lawn? I didn't think so. You also have gas and oil spills again polluting the environment and yourself. You have so many maintenance costs with a gas mower that an electric mower virtually pays for itself.This is our second electric mower. It replaces a Neuton 14 inch mower that we used for many years and that we loved. It was getting time for another battery on the Neuton and I knew I wanted to go with a 19 inch mower this time. Based on the good reviews of the Black and Decker I decided to give it a try. So far I have been very impressed. We have a 50 by 50 foot backyard, about 8 foot wide side yards (in the middle of a suburban block) and around a 25 by 30 front yard. I can comfortably do the entire yard in one charge.The cut is great, the mower leaves the lawn looking exceptionally good. There is way more power than the old 14 inch mower for tougher spots. The mower is very comfortable to push, it has a great handle. But it is a bit heavy. I could potentially see this being a problem for some people. The handles fold down easily for storage and not only is the mower height super easy to adjust but there is a handy height gage you can read to see how high it is set. It is not as quiet as the Neuton, but around I'd say half the noise of a gas powered mower. The battery is easy to charge, easy to take out and put back in. Basically mowing becomes an easy, non-hazardous, healthy activity. Rather than sometimes a pain you know where and a self-polluting and environmental polluting chore you want to avoid as much as possible.In conclusion I want to say this is not a 100% pollution free activity. The batteries need to be disposed of properly and of course there is pollution associated with the electricity you use. But electricity generated at a power plant is many dozens of times less polluting per unit of energy than the pollution generated at a single gas lawn mower engine. But still this is a remarkable piece of win-win technology. It IS much greener, overall, than a gas mower. It WILL save you money. Every year you will pay much less to operate and maintain this mower. It CAN be used for bigger lots. You would need to buy another battery depending upon how big your lot was but because you can charge these at any time separate from the mower itself so you can always have 2 batteries to go.My bottomline though is how much happier I am to mow. No yanking. No getting gas and oil on me. No tune ups. No spark plugs. No loud noises. No feeling dirty and polluted and just dreading having to mow."
79770,"Other pedals in this category can be anywhere from 50-150 and more.  I just wanted a decent simple pedal that could be used on occasion with my garage band buddies.  This is perfect.  I've only used a few times so I can't testify to the durabilty, but it sounds great.  Does exactly what you want out of an analog delay pedal."

79772,"I'm reviewing this after spending a couple or so hours trying to get this to work with my Behringer 802 Xenyx mixer, and I finally did after nearly throwing in the towel.  Turns out I was using my mixer's CD/Tape switch incorrectly, thus getting very poor results or excruciating feedback.  I finally went on You Tube and found a Behringer guy that has a video that's less than 2 minutes in length and he had the unit hooked up to a mixer and computer.  Just taking a look at the that video made me realize it was something simple I was doing wrong - I was over-thinking it. Once I got it to working correctly, I could not believe the results once everything was dialed in correctly, including the control on my PC that controlled the recording volume for this unit.  So, now I'm looking forward to doing some real recording with it, using Audacity as my main recording software. (Edit: I did some recording with this dealie over the weekend and was really, really pleased with the results - I can hardly wait to do some more recording with this. So, to the arrogant salesman who bad-mouthed this at a local music chain store and tried to sale me a $150.00 Lexicon unit, I won't be needing that - I'm quite happy with this little interface, thank you very much. And to everyone else, don't forget that you can keep this thing hooked up to your PC and use it to simply listen to music on your hard drive and it will sound a lot better than your stock on-board sound card.  Thanks Behringer, this is a great value!!"
79773,"The idea of the platform feeder is great.  We have several bird feeders around our house, mostly hanging in trees suspended so they can be lowered for cleaning and filling.  Each and every one is constantly raided by our plethora of squirrels.  The plastic of the feeders is chewed apart by the squirrels, most of the seed goes to them, and the rest they find ways to jump on the feeders to spill the seeds on the ground where they all can gather with ease.The design of the Perky-Pet includes an Umbrella type cover that attaches loosely to the hanger.  It is meant to be loose so that if a squirrel or other mean, old seed predator tries to jump on top, it simply tips to the side and they fall off.  It does do that...the squirrels have failed in every attempt to gain access.  However, in any breeze, that same umbrella top flips around, up and down, from side to side, and scares the birds off!As a result, after 2 weeks of hanging in a tree, nary a seed is gone.  Guess it will help save costs of seed, but I am hoping the birds adjust to it soon.UPDATED POST:I am going to have to locate a spot completely out of the wind for this feeder.  Calm, almost windless day today and the birds are all over it.  Meanwhile, the squirrels keep trying and it is fun watching them become dive-bombers to the ground.  I have secluded spots to place it, but the only trouble is it's out of sight from any window, and is not where we can enjoy seeing the birds feeding.FINAL UPDATE:This feeder is never going to be worthwhile.  It needed to be removed from any area that had wind, even light breezes, and we did that.  Unfortunately, birds like to feed where there is cover and the only place this could be mounted was in a small niche in the house side.  No birds came to feed.  Taking it down tomorrow and putting it away in the basement."

79775,"Occasionally I'm pleasantly surprised by a 'B' bin movie. In the same genre I quite enjoyed &#34;eight legged freaks&#34; which was silly fun with surprisingly competent special effects. Sadly, however, this film does not deliver. Two stars is quite generous for what a film that is full of missed opportunities for humor, satire, irony and just plain fun. Not as badly made as the typical SyFy channel movie (which is the hallmark of absolute horribleness) however this film doesn't rank much above the offal they typically serve up."

79778,"If there's one thing I can say...don't listen to the commentary.  The writer isn't there so it's all effects stuff and the director stroking his own ego with some quipping from Ron Perlman.But...believe it or not this is actually a fairly competent movie that looks good, has lots of action, and doesn't really feel like anything you've probably ever seen.  It's noir-esque with flashes of color sort of like sky captain but it just feels like a competent sci-fi flick.  You won't care about the characters, the plot is kind generic and doesn't really make sense, but it's not supposed to...this is a popcorn flick that never made it to theaters with a TON of recognizable stars.  The most impressive fact is that most of the imagery wasn't cgi but scaled models with green screen acting.I, honestly, watch a lot of ""B"" movies.  This is more of a B+ movie...meaning that it doesn't have the typical made for sci-fi channel computer graphics but it's not really fleshed out enough to be an A movie in this genre.  I probably would've shelled out 8 bucks to see it in theaters and it's really a shame that it never made it to theaters.  It will probably go down as an all-time flop but doesn't really deserve that treatment."
79779,"I have purchased several amps over the last 7 months (see the reviews). I attempted to move to tube amps becuase I wanted to set up a pedal board and dial in my own effects. And really, any reading you do on web pages will eventually take to tubes. I went Vox AC4 and realized I didn't want a tube that already has a defined and limited sound (no fault of the amp - I just had to experience it myself). I also didn't want a modeler impersonating a tube. I loved the Orange Crush, but it was totally unreliable.Enter the ZT. Holy-moley. The amp has limited gain available to give you traditional tube behavior. Nice break up, very reactive to your playing and literally miles of clean head room. But unlike those tube amps - my pedals can come into play and I can manipulate that clean sound at any level without losing a bit of clarity or depth. It also has an iPod jack, headphone jack and ambiance (i.e. make it sound kind of boxy). It does not model. Like the Crush or Roland Cube, it has it's own voice. I've heard it compars to a Fender Tweed in tone. I guess I can see that, but it still has it's own voice - which is important to me in any amp. I should note - an AC30 or Fender Twin or high end 1x12 Tube still are louder and much fuller. But we're talking $1000+ tube amps.I don't have the matching extension cabinet because I just don't need it. It is REALLY loud. I have a Mustang III and it gets destroyed by the ZT. At 75% volume on the dial, I can hit my DS-1 and actually make out the notes. That is something the Vox AC4 or Fender Blues Junior cannot do without getting muddy. It is fully giggable. I haven't played live with it yet, but in a rehearsel environment, keeping with a loud drummer is no issue. A friend plugged it into his Marshall 4x12 and it was thunderous. Really, just stupid powerful for $300.For blues, jazz or light rock, it's brilliant right out of the box. It not only can do medal with a pedal board, but check youtube for videos of the Lunchbox being played in a live setting by a metal band. It has tube power in 10 lbs with solid state flexibility. I would also encourage anyone to scour the net for reviews and video. You simply will not find a negative thing about the ZT Lunchbox anywhere. It really is a solid state aimed to take prefessionals away from their bigger, heavier, more expensive tubes. If you play effect laden music, boy are you going to have a hard time walking away from the ZT.If there is a drawback - $300 for a solid state amp that really needs external pedals to shine could be a turn off for some - especially for players looking for a swiss army knife for an amp. Roland, Fender, Line6 and others still have that niche dialed in."
79780,"I have had this feeder about 6 weeks now and made several observations:1. It is well made, sturdy, tough, all metal zinc plated steel and will likely be very durable.2. Large capacity - holds 2.5 pounds black oil sunflower seeds requiring fewer refills.3. Easy to refill through large door on the top, without taking the feeder down.4. Cover or roof on top offers some protection from the rain (if it's not blowing).5. So far, not getting as much attention or use from the birds as my other feeders  but of course the birds are accustomed to the older feeders.6. Some reviewers complain the openings in the mesh are too small and birds can't get the seed out.  I am undecided about this but I doubt it is the case because if you shake the feeder some seed will fall out and through the mesh onto the platform.  I can say for sure there is less waste due to spillage of sunflower seeds compared to my other feeders- a big plus.7. I only wish it was available in a selection of colors.  I would prefer a more natural less gaudy color such as dark green, brown or black.  For me, the show is not the feeder, the show is the birds."

79785,You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people.
79786,"I got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards (well duh!)  Does it work?  Yes and no.  First it did not appear that anything was coming out.  After a bit of rubbing I did notice a &#34;slight&#34; bit of solution (turns out its mineral oil)on the fretboard by the frets.  I tried to spread it out with the included cloth and discovered that the cloth was useless (a paper towel would hold up better- seriously!)  I used an old tee shirt square and spread some of the oil around- but honestly it took me 10 to 15 mins and I noticed NO difference in the appearence or the playability of the guitar.  It says to use it before and after each session- thats about 30 mins of my time per guitar (I general play 2 guitars durning the course of a session).  I do still use this occasionally, but I would not spend money to purchase it again.  Just not what I was looking for in a fret board cleaner."

79788,"Glue traps are simultaneously better and worse than snap traps or poison.Glue traps are safer if you have pets and/or children around as pets are less likely to get stuck on them than to eat the sweet-smelling poison (it smells just as good to pets as it does to mice). Even if your pet gets stuck on the glue trap, they are usually bigger than the trap or will bark and indicate for you to free them. Releasing poison from a pet's system is very hard, and often impossible. Even if you set up a bait station that is covered, the mice or rats will go to die elsewhere and your pet might find them and eat them and be exposed to the poison that way.On the other hand, glue traps are not for the faint of heart. With the poison, you will not see where the mouse or rat dies (which is sometimes a problem on itself as you might have a dead, foul-smelling rodent in the house). With these glue traps you will have to face the mouse or the rat and they will usually still be alive when you find that you caught a creature.The rodent will not be able to free itself from the glue trap and will die of starvation, i.e., a slow painful death. Arguably, it's probably no better than bleeding to death from the rat poison or dying from being crushed by a snap trap.Glue traps are also useful to catch crawlers that stumble upon it or walk across it.You must check the traps you set out at least every 24 hours to make sure you are getting rid of the dead animals -- or you can spread infection and no one wants a dead rat in their house."
79789,"Back in 2007 I was in Toronto and met some guys who screened Demons 2 one night.  Before the film began they showed a collection of film trailers for Argento films, spaghetti westerns and such, and then the original HOBO trailer played.  It was a wonderfully done trailer that rivaled the ones used in the Tarantino/Rodriguez Grindhouse film.  The director was present in the theater but I didn't speak to him then(too bad), but I always remembered the trailer.  I never thought it would actually become a feature film, let alone star Rutger Hauer.So here we are-Hobo With A Shotgun is a reality, and the exploitation world is the better for it.  Basically it's about a hobo that comes into a crime ridden town and decides to go Bronson when he's seen(and experienced) enough.  The town in the movie is super exaggerated in it's criminal activity-it's a friggin' warzone!  Think of the gang ruled neighborhood in Death Wish 3 and that's how this entire town is!  But then again, everything here is exaggerated.  This movie is very cartoony and brings to mind images of Troma(in fact, a character in the film is wearing a Troma shirt in one scene).  Rutger Hauer is the odd one out in that he's basically the ""normal"", non-cartoon character here.  And that really makes it work.  His downplaying against everyone else's over the top playing really helps give the movie that additional edge to bring it above being total silliness(along with the hot young lady who plays the prostitute.  I forgot her name at the moment).  We all love Hauer, you'd have to be some kind of communist not to.  Though he's been in numerous B movies throughout the years, we've never seen him in something quite like this, something more tongue in cheek.  Movies like Bleeders, Crossworlds and Turbulence 3-Heavy Metal were schlock, but schlock taking itself a bit more seriously.  It's a nice change of pace for Hauer.The film has a decent amount of gore.  Some say it surpasses Machete.  I'm not sure if it does.  Perhaps, but unlike Machete, the gore here is not CGI, which elevates it substantially.The second disc(if you're thinking of buying the 2 disc version) has a nice Making Of.. documentary, interviews with Hauer and director Eisener by Fangoria magazine, the alternate ending, and the original fake trailer(though this may be on disc one, I forgot).  I haven't watched the film on ""Shotgun Mode"" yet, so I'm not sure on that one.All in all, a very good ""grindhouse"" style film here.  Usually these modern throwback movies leave alot to be desired and make you wish you had used your time to watch an actual grindhouse movie instead of these weak imitations.Hobo With A Shotgun is one to be proud of the grindhouse throwback status.  It earns it."

79793,"I came to know about this tool when I was browsing the web for finding the details how to look for Hybrid Battery temperature on my recently acquired used 2006 Ford Escape Hybrid. The forum suggested to their members thatScanGauge IIwould be the ideal choice to monitor the Motor Electronics Coolant Temp (MeC) and HV Battery temperature (Traction Battery Temp).I am pleased to inform that this tool can be configured with Ford Specific XGauges (See comments) to achieve that feat pretty easily. Ford Escape Hybrid (With Navigation) does have host of other real-time display like HV battery SOC real-time MPG on the dash but FORD hides most of the stuff from user which are needed to troubleshoot common check engine light errors and in my case why my FORD escape Hybrid sometimes decides not to turn off the Internal combustion engine (ICE) and keeps running the Radiator FANs when it should not. It baffled me for couple of weeks and led me to investigate the issue further.After setting this tool up and monitoring it for several days I could see a pattern that there are two main reason why the ICE would not shut down at idle or at a stop light. They were primarily due to 'over-temp' condition of the Motor Electronics Coolant temperature caused by a weak MCE coolant pump in conjunction with the HV battery Traction battery temperature.Replacing the nearly failed original 2006 Motor electronics Coolant Pump at 98,XXX miles (FORD OEM PART number 5M6Z-8C419-A) It did help in cooling the Motor electronics coolant temperature a little bit however the traction battery FANS are still an issue which I am continuing to investigate using this Automotive computer Gauge.FYI, There is a disturbing trend in these line of 2005-2007 FORD Escape hybrid vehicles that calls for Air-Conditioning compressor to turn ON as soon as the HV battery temp reaches 95 to 96.8 F to cool the battery using the rear air-conditioning contraption by opening the blend door and what not but as your car ages the Internal two fans housed inside the HV battery tends to fail slowly (without actually flagging any DTC codes) and thereby no matter how much AC compressor works hard (Only with ICE running) it cannot cool the HV battery enough to go under 94F for the ICE to stop at idle or at a STOP sign.It is winter here in California and thanks for mother nature my HV battery rarely calls for cooling for most of the stop and go traffic and I still have not ventured to replace the two Internal HV battery FANs (FORD OEM PART 5M6Z-10C659-A) on my Ford Escape Hybrid but I do closely monitor the temperatures using this valuable tool.Bottom line: An excellent tool to have for any gasoline or diesel engines for real-time MPG and RPM readings as well as read understand and clear (Check Engine Light) DTC codes. Well worth the price as it pay for itself in less than a year if you come across a check engine light and could decode yourself and clear it. Or just by using this tool to carefully change your driving habits and improving the gas mileage.I am amazed how crazy some drivers are who accelerate hard cut in front of you, overtake you just to stop in front of you at a STOP Light. Did you know how much Gas you could save just by decelerating slowly and watch for the traffic pattern ahead of you? - You can save nearly 30% of your gas tank not to mention less wear and tear of you brakes and other stuff when you learn to drive less aggressively.Drive safe!, Drive intelligently and save on gas!Cheers!"

79804,"Trying to keep a full-size black truck clean, such as my GMC Sierra Denali can be a challenge. It's not easy finding the right wash accessories to get the job done quickly and correctly. And given the dark color, I'm quite cautious when it comes to using the right stuff. Well, I gave it a good test this past weekend when I was cleaning off 2 weeks of rain, dirt, and grime.The big concern is that with a very dirty vehicle, washing by hand can basically move dirt around on the paint. Obviously this can have a very negative effect on the pain. This is why touch washes can be so bad. Not to mention the possibility of getting the previous vehicles dirt. It's important that the wash mitt is able to pull the dirt away while washing. With this design, it looks like that is accomplished.Personally, I prefer to go through a basic touch-less wash if the vehicle is dirty, as a first step. The high pressure soap/water will remove the big scratch-prone dirt. Then go home and do the rest by hand. Rise, wash with soap, water, and the mitt. Use a gritt guard in your bucket so you can run the mitt across each time to help ensure large dirt is removed. Rinse, dry, and enjoy.The truck looked great. No scratches or scuffs. The soft wash mitt's design also allowed it to get into the little crevices such as the grill and badge to get it clean. Still looks shiny. Highly recommend this wash mitt."

There are very simple planting instructions for both ground and pots, planting indoors to start, a paper measuring tape to space the seeds, estimated time to germination and harvest.They include a sheet of label info listing each plant and fertilizer used and planting instructions. One needs a magnifying glass to read that sheet.  Just follow the growing guide.Steps: Plant pod, water and wait.  One removes the pod cover, pushes it into loose soil level, and keep it moist. They provide a packet of fertilizer.The secret to any garden is daily care: weed, water and fertilize.  Don't miss a day- especially early on.  Miracle-Gro offer suggestions on the guide and at their website. I plant some pots, some in the ground.  Less issue with weeds in the pots.  Out where we live, dry, high plains, if you water and provide any kind of semi-fertile soil, the high praire grass/weeds think it's just for them.  So do the deer.  Will work nice on a patio as well, but don't let the sun burn them out.The best part on this system, it's easier to plant and control; seeds don't wash off; the depth is just right.  Not organic, if that matters, you'll have a great garden if you just stick with it.  Happy gardening!"
79806,"First, an important caution when reading reviews of this product. Amazon has a policy of grouping all reviews of all formats of a film (theater, Amazon Instant  DVD, BD) together. As I submit this review there are already 23 reviews posted, only one of which is of the DVD or Bluray. So, I always suggest to look to see which product is being reviewed and to look for the date of the review. That will guide you best. Now on to my review of the Bluray.Of  the thousands of reviews I&#8217;ve written for Amazon I&#8217;ve rarely &#8211; if ever &#8211; felt that there was another review of a product that covered practically everything one could say about it. But after reading David Kusumoto&#8217;s review of the Bluray/DVD release of this film, I have to send you there for a thorough and well-written review. I&#8217;ll try to add a few more facts and my take on the film and the package.&#8220;Good Ol&#8217; Freda&#8221; started making the film festival circuit in early 2013 and played at the WXPN Music Film Festival in Philadelphia in April 2013. I missed that one shot chance to catch it, but heard great things from friends and was anxious for the home video release. Magnolia films has been making a name for itself in releasing music related documentaries (&#8220;Muscle Shoals&#8221; was also at the April WXPN festival &#8211; and I did catch it and it&#8217;s great &#8211; and Magnolia will be releasing it in January (hopefully with lots of bonuses). But back to Freda.As David pointed out in his review, there is a wonderful commentary track that reveals more stories than are shone in the film. But, remember that Freda was a loyal dedicated secretary for 11 years (one year LONGER than the Beatles were together as a band) and no real secrets are revealed. But, when she discusses the parents of the &#8220;boys&#8221; &#8211; especially weekly teas with Ringo&#8217;s mom (she only refers to Ringo as &#8220;Ringo&#8221; in the Q&A; at at Beatlefest  - included as a bonus; in the film he is always called &#8220;Richie&#8221; and Brian Epstein is called &#8220;Eppie&#8221;  - you get a deeper feeling for the family life of the Fab Four.In one of the bonus interviews with the Director of the film, we learn that he shot 50 hours of film and says that he hopes that much of it would be on the DVD release. But there are only five scenes totaling just 12 minutes. (I&#8217;m not complaining &#8211; just commenting).As noted by others &#8211; four Beatles songs are included in the soundtrack, along with a bunch of classic songs that the Beatles covered (by Arthurs Alexander, The Chiffons, Marvelettes) including the most expensive to license: Ketty Lester&#8217;s &#8220;Love Letters&#8221;. Oddly enough the Lester recording was not remastered and has lots of &#8220;crackle&#8221;. Surely they could have found a better copy to use. (again, a comment, not a complaint.So, in summary, all Beatles fans will want this Bluray, even if you have seen the film at a festival. And, even if you are a casual music listener who grew up with their music, you&#8217;ll find the 87-minute film and its bonuses, worth watching.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;"
79807,"This movie was funny,  but one of those rare movie with a novel premise.  That alone was funny. But the charaters were really good and hysterical. The actors gave the characters some depth so it was more than just good fun! Lot's of inside P jokes of course!"
79808,"I bought Season 2, knowing from the reviews that it would be much more complex and difficult to follow than the first season.  But, hey, I decided, I'll just watch each episode twice to make sure I can follow it--and now I get to watch even more of Revenge!!  I'm guessing the producers are watching the feedback and will make the right changes so that Season 3 will be more to our liking."
79809,"Clips are pretty good, the short protection fuse is a nice touch. the end cap is odd for a removable clip all and all pretty good."
79810,"My neighbor and I try to choose and start new plants each year.  We plant them in pots and put them in the garage until spring arrives.  This year we are doing tulips and we used this garden soil to start the plants.  We are also planning to do lettuce in the bag this year.  We are going to take a big bag of MG garden soil and poke small drain holes in the bottom, cut 6 circles in it, and then plant 6 butter lettuce plants in the bag.  Minimal watering, limited heat - great salads we hope!"
79811,The leads are very good. This season is showing more depth in Gabriel Macht's character. The plot twists are exciting.
79812,"I like it!  Seems to work fine and numbers are consistent.  I like that it displays different measurements of pressure (psi, bar, etc).  I live in Europe so all the gas stations don't measure in PSI.  This device has all the different measurements at the press of a button.  Light is useful to in low visibility!  Its also the coolest looking air pressure gauge I've ever owned!"
79813,"Using the XX to cover a yamaha v-star with many extras (flor boards, windshield, luggage rack, saddle bags. It's plenty big enough and not too big, very easy to put on, I don't use the bungee hooks because the elastic seems to hold good enough but they are an added bonus. Price was good just over 40"
79814,"You just cant go wrong with Royal Purple. I get around 10k miles out of this Royal Purple HPS oil and Royal Purple oil filter. 2001 f150 5.4L V8. Takes 6 quarts and doesn't leak a drop. 124,xxx and counting."
79815,I switched over to using an Android tablet for notation when playing music. All of my 7&#34; tablets fit and even my larger HP Touchpad fits. I ended up using an Ainol Fire as my regular tablet. It would be nice if there was just a tiny bit more tilt up but it does what it is supposed to and it fits securely on the mic stand.
79816,"The item was just as discribed. Genuine Leather, it does fit sung. My wheel is a PT Crusier GT. It is leather, but it's starting to show wear. So I bought this to try? It was a bit hard to put on. So I laid it in the Sun for awhile. It went on. But don't add anything to help it along. You don't want it to slip. My Steering Wheel is 15"", but it fits like it was made for it! My secret for keeping them looking HOT, is KIWI Black shoe polish, hand rubbed. SW"
79817,"I bought it for my 2001 Dodge Intrepid. I used exactly one bottle, 1 gallaon, of it and mixed it with 1 gallon of distilled water. I did a complete flush using the Zerex flush it works perfect also if anyone was wondering it's a redish orange colour."
79818,"Really exciting, fast moving show, and Raylan is so darn good looking. Can't wait to watch each new show. Great series"
79819,These really do work for the little black ants I have. I use them outside and inside both. Good product.
79820,Good quality sound and video and always a few surprises as the quest for gold continues. Well edited and produced.
79821,"If you can get through the first few episodes, this show gets good again. I really loved the first few seasons, and I think the reason why this season got off to a bad start is that the tension between Nick and Jess liking each other was finally ended when they got together. A lot of the early episodes in this season get sappy and gushy at the end... Not what I'm looking for in a comedy... But thankfully that seems to get toned down a bit with the later episodes."
79822,"included in the first show buildup. That said, it's frakin great. Cannot wait till Barbie is outed to the hot redhead. Lots goin' on. It's fun!"
79823,"Easy enough to apply and not messy.In order to test it's effectiveness we not only applied this to our own trees but with the permission of one of our neighbors we applied it to two of her trees as well. This was two months ago and I have to admit that all the trees that were treated with this product were avoided by the deer. Including our neighbors two trees, while her other trees and bushes were chewed on instead. I suppose it will remain to be seen how long it will last over all, I'm sure we got the mileage we did because of the extended dry weather we experienced her in Wyoming this summer. Moisture I'm sure would wash away the Deer-off rather quickly otherwise.This bottle contained enough to cover 8 trees and 4 small shrubs. In a dry climate one dose can last up to two months, however I'm sure that in a wetter climate multiple re-applications would be necessary."
79824,"Picked up a cable to test on my new pedalboard, and I couldn't be happier. Doesn't suck tone, cables are sturdy, and they sound great. This replaced a normal straight 1/4 inch cable and saves so much space on my board."
79825,"I like the idea to conserve water, and this is made to specifically extend the use of your hot tub water by clearing it up.  I used it on what I thought was a clean tub, but it showed me different.It says it can break up gunk in the filter pump and it sure did.I let it run for 30 minutes and got clear water and a nasty gunk rim, that I removed with paper. I now use this once a month in addition to my regular cleaning to keep away the gunk and keep the spa ring free."
79826,"this probably is the best season. I've seen that written several times but it has a great story line that has not lost any quality over the years. the characters are still fun and interesting. Sam and Jesse are great for lightening up the situation. Fiona is always awesome and I watch it to see what will happen with her and Michael. I am so sad to not have any more episodes to watch. the writing, acting, plot twists - they've all maintained a strong quality"
79827,"Cutter Backwoods Dry 25-Percent  Aerosol Spray, It does go on dry and non greasy. Has the scent of original off. It did keep the mosquitoes off and the biting horse flies while we were working in our gardens and cutting wood. It says that it will repel mosquitoes that carrier West Nile Virus, I even used it on our chairs when we sat around the evening fire."
79828,"Well, this does work, but not really as I expected. it sure polished my front lights plastic, but certainly not as well as it was described in other reviews. I guess, OK for the price."
79829,"Some have noted that a lot of work is needed with this polish.  That is true but you need to know what results you desire.  The finer the polish, the more work will be required because less material is removed but you also have less risk of damage and the end result is more mirror like.  This polish is very fine so it will take some elbow grease if applying it by hand but the results are excellent.  If you have a lot of material to remove, start with a polish that has greater cutting properties then finish with this.  You will like the results."
79830,"I hate mice.REALLY hate them.But, as much as I hate them, I don't want them to suffer.So I've been buying and trying various ways to kill the little devils. I'd abandoned conventional snap traps as too gross and you don't always get a clean kill. I don't like the idea of glue traps because the poor mouse suffers. The same with poison, plus I hate finding mouse carcasses scattered around. My favorite way to dispatch them is to use electronic mouse traps. They die quicly and probably painlessly, but you have to empty the trap and that can be gross. My wife wants nothing to do with disposing of the remains.For the squeamish, the victor kill and seal is a good option. It kills them quickly and seals up the remains permanently. They're pretty easy to set up and place. But my biggest problem with the solution is the cost per trap. It's about double what I'd pay for a trap, but it does work as advertised. I think Victor's overselling the parasite angle, but I think most people would be more interested in hiding the body and not having to worry about seeing it afterward. For a major infestation, it can be an expensive option. In that event, consider buying the Victor electronic trap."
79831,"They Came Together is the most playful endeavor since Wet Hot. That quintessential off balance approach that Mr. Wain is known for is back in full force. Before going to bed, my wife and I looked at each other and said &#34;Hey..... Thank you&#34;.  Then I walked out the door, stopped, and turned around and repeated myself."
79832,"While still full of all the handsome and fashion you expect from a White Collar episode, this was much more action-packed, almost to the level of an episode of Burn Notice."
79833,"This has been a big step up from my old Black and Decker cordless.  For starters the battery last about 2x as long as the B&D; ever did.  I know because I used to trim about half my bushes before I had to drop it on the charger and the Toro can finish my whole yard.  Right there, I'm sold.  It also cuts a little easier which is also helping my trim time come down.  The weight is comparable to the B&D; and much better than my old gas trimmer.The swivel feature is surprisingly nice.  My first thought was ""gimmick"" but the improved comfort is noticeable.  It's actually a big plus in the usability column.  Overall this is an awesome hedge trimmer with lots to recommend it and no draw backs that I've encountered.  I've got a decent number of bushes to trim and I've never looked back at a gas powered trimmer since I went cordless.  No noise, no mixing gas and oil for the two stroke, and much lighter."
79834,I use these sponges to apply leather cleaner an leather conditioner to my car.  The are absorbent and can be rinsed out for future use.  They are soft and supple and gentle on the material you are cleaning and conditioning.
79835,"I love the detail and the science behind the cooking techniques demonstrated by Alton. I've made several of his recipes and the dishes are better than any 5 star restaurant. Yes, I am a chef of many years, but the information produced on Good Eats is priceless if you're interesting in being a better cook."
79836,Good clean and colorful fun for a four old.  I can always be sure that she will be entertained as she learns about the world she lives in.
79837,"I've been recording on my iMac, iPod Touch, iPad, and iPhone for some time, using Garage Band. Interfacing with the iMac is easy, using various USB devices- I'm currently using a USB-equipped Alesis preamp. iOS device interface is a bit more difficult; it is possible to use USB preamps, with an externally powered USB hub, but that starts getting very complicated and messy.  I've been using simple devices like the 1K that  split the headphone/microphone jack into two separate cords, one for headphone, and one for guitar. The problem with this sort of configuration is that it's very easy to overload the microphone input, and the recording quality done this way is not very good. The Apogee JAM is a big improvement over this method for a number of reasons. First, it contains its own dedicated preamp and A/D, and because of that it delivers a wide dynamic range and excellent fidelity. Interface issues are non-existent; plugged into both the iPad and iPhone it was immediately recognized. I didn't have any problems with either of the three supplied cables.The JAM is significantly more expensive than the simple interfaces, but on the whole I think it's worth it. It's simple to use, has no detectable latency, and delivers excellent sound quality. It does seem to draw a fair amount of current, and battery life  is shortened significantly when using this with an iPhone. You'll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions. With the iPad, this isn't as noticeable. Even with that issue, I think the JAM is a good value.  The various iOS devices are capable of making very high quality recordings, but only with quality input. Given the cost of an new iPhone or iPad, the cost of the JAM is rather trivial in comparison."
79838,"The Zen Buddist philosopher and motorcyclist Robert M. Persig once said ""The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands.""  This is the tool that places it all in your hands!The leverage afforded by this device is unbelievable.  With this tool, you can remove any wheel at any time.  It also gives you the torque to reinstall the wheel as well as if you had a impact driver.  The sockets included with the wrench cover just about any lug nut out there.  The handy bag keeps the kit all together in your trunk.  It is well made and it is all good.We all know that automobile tires go flat at midnight in the rain.  With this item, we still will not be happy about it, but this tool makes an unpleasant job a lot nicer!Get one and be prepared to change the world, one tire at a time!"
79839,"This is a well made guitar strap, and is exactly as described. Suede is of course less slippery than smooth leather, and 2 inches is fairly narrow. If this is what you want, then this guitar strap is perfect. If you prefer the strap slip easily, or distribute the weight of a heavy guitar more, then it won't be.Definitely top notch if this is what you are after though. 5-stars."
79840,"The show is always entertaining. Some of the stories are kind of routine (I might have docked it half a star for that) but others are quite suspenseful. Olyphant has constructed a fine character straight out of mystery novels, and the supporting cast of highly accomplished actors is really excellent. Margo Martindale (also from The Americans, and -who knew- over 80 other film credits) is outstanding, as is Nick Searcy, who shows great depth and humor as chief marshal. Walton Goggins, lately seen in Django Unchained,  is always good."
79841,"It doesn't leak. The 90 degree, plus a support piece I added to the utility bay takes ALL the strain off of the fittings and hose!"
79842,Works as advertised. Very easy to manipulate to get to the valve stem to check pressure on my motorcycle. It should since that is what is was made for.
79843,Great for working with metals and woods if you want a real fine and smooth finish. So get some and get sanding.
79844,"After I fixed my blunder of setting the bird feeder on the Nyger Seed setting while I had regular bird seed in the vessel, all has been delightful.  Watching the birds is so relaxing.  I'm sure they are speaking to each other saying &#34;it took long enough to figure out the feeder has two settings!&#34;  The instructions mention this, but I overlooked it."
79845,Rookie Blue is WELL-WORTH the cost. Season 3 has taken on a whole new/AWESOME level. Kudos to the writers and actors. This episode will captivate you. The emotional journey is one that is so gracefully put together that even as an avid fan it drew me in more than ever.
79846,"Performs as advertised. Takes a little getting used to on the throttle. I us it for longer trips on the turnpike, not around town. goes on & off easily but holds tight once in place. Really saves your wrist & fingers on long trips."
79847,"I had to recently buy a second one of these, after somehow losing the original one I had. Just to give you an idea of how solidly built these are, I bought my first and original one 6 years ago and never had to change the battery a single time. Outside of carrying a set of jumper cables in your car, carrying a quality tire pressure gauge is priceless."
79848,"I use this mainly for my stabilizers, I use this for every camping trip.  Nice color so you don't leave them behind."
79849,"I received a couple of new 36 volt powered Black & Decker lawn tools that eventually replaced my gas operated ones. The big selling points for me were the surprising power, weight, and of course no more storage of gas containers. The big downside for this line up of Black & Decker tools is overall battery power. It doesn't take long for the battery to drain. Over the course of six months, I purchased a couple of these B&D; LBXR 36 volt batteries as backup.Out of the clam shell casing, these batteries do not come fully charged. The battery is outfitted with an on board LED power indicator. Just press the button and I get a reading of how much power is left. As is with most B&D; 36 volt lawn powered equipment, there is a multi level power setting. The higher the setting the less juice users will have in the end. Fully charged I get almost a half hour before a noticeable drop off in juice. Usually recharging the battery takes less then ninety minutes. Key word is usually.Including the four batteries that came with my lawn gear, I now have a total of six. I always mark the batteries with a date code. Its a great help, especially when battery replacement is required. None of my batteries, including the ones that came with the equipment are not anywhere near being a year old. Still, I have had issues with two of the batteries so far. One came with a tool, while the other was a purchase I made last December. Both no longer provide accurate power readings via the unit's indicator. The other problem is that it takes almost eight hours to fully charge them. Both loose their charge within minutes of use.Thankfully the manufacturer tacks on a three year warranty for these batteries. The company's customer service team has been outstanding with providing me support. On both occasions, I received a replacement battery. Like anything else now days quality control is an issue. I do like this new lineup of Black & Decker 36 volt powered lawn tools. On the other hand, the 36 volt lithium batteries have their moments. Two bad batteries out of six is not a good average. There is too much inconsistency. Add that to the fact that these batteries are way overpriced for what they do not provide. Its hit and miss with this product."
79850,Had too use them while out dry camping. My truck weighs about 9500 lbs and it held it up but the ends where starting to buckle my buddies truck weighs a bit more and they did not hold up to the 1600lb rating he sent his back.
79851,"Loved being pulled in... this episode journeyed thru sci-fi, supernatural. possible apocalypse and the chaos that would erupt. I am anxious to see the characters and story again... Hurry with the next episode."
79852,"Great action in most episodes. Also, good suspense. Surprisingly, the patriotism displayed by these special ops guys is not overdone or offensive, and is very plausible. This season took on some difficult topics, like guilt over the many killings they are asked to do and PTSD that affects marriages and produces affairs. We see hidden agendas and conflict of interest in many episodes. Acting is pretty good too. The season finale was anticlimactic and a little disappointing to me."
79853,"I have installed 3 of these over the past several years. They are wonderful compared to the ones that sit on the ground. You don't have to worry about them moving around as you try to wind the hose up, provided that you have securely attached it to you house or shed. There are four mounting holes at the rear corners of the mount.The spinning action of the reel is very smooth and easy. The handle is made of a comfortable rubber that seems like it will last for many years. The one I have in full sun has shone some fading of the finish after 2 years but otherwise doesn't show and signs of rust or breakdown. They can hold up to 150 feet of hose. I like to keep a spray nozzle on my hoses and when winding the hose up I usually wind till the top storage shelf of the reel is in the v-notch of the hand sprayer. It keeps the hose tight and everything tidy.I am very happy with these. Best garden hose reel I have ever owned. 5 stars!"
79854,"The Sons keep it coming at you, always that element of surprise. Love it, great writing, riviting performance, story line keep you at the edge wanting more 2 thumbs up!Crucifixed"
79855,"The story continues to get better, and while there always seems to be a &#34;trouble do the week&#34;, interesting story arcs and a mythos has been developing. Looking forward to the next season."
79856,"This stuff works great and the price and shipping were all excellent.  I ended up thinking one roll would work on a F250 front door, nope.  It took nearly two rolls, so I had to order more, but that's okay, I did."
79857,Love these show! The characters are funny and convincing and we can't wait to see what the next season brings!
79858,"We used to have nice looking yard, but then we got two big dogs who have wreaked havoc on our lawn and now there is just dirt spots and the grass has vanished. I thought this would help bring the grass back, because it is there it just needs come help. It says you will see results in 3 to 5 days, but I have seen any results yet and it has been over a week since I put it out. I used a spreader to put it out in my yard, and I have added grass seeds and I have watered and there has been spring showers here and still nothing so far. Maybe it takes more 3 to 5 days...I will have to wait and see.It says it has no odor, and it does have an odor but it is faint it isn't that bad and I only smell it when I am taking it out of the bag. When I am spreading it around the yard I don't smell it anymore.I like that is safe around pets, since we have two dogs out where I am laying this. And I have a toddler who wants to go out in the back too so that is a plus."
79859,"This is a much cheaper alternative to dynamat and works even better than it.  It's thick, but easy to handle in terms of cutting (use a utility blade) and very sticky so it adheres well.  One thing to beware of is to ensure you do not use bare hands when pressing down on the surface as the aluminum layer you cut through is sharp and will easily slice through your fingers.How much will you need?  This has 36 squares to it.  Most small to midsize cars will need about 60 squares for comprehensive coverage of all doors, trunk, quarter panels,and wheelwells - you'll need more if you want to do the floors. So you'll need to order 2 boxes.  Luxury vehicles with extensive soundproofing will probably be able to get away with just 1 box though.  For those with performance vehicles, realize this does add considerable weight if you start throwing in too many so use caution with the right amount of weight penalty to coverage.  For those who haven't already done so, you probably want to do a speaker upgrade on your doors when you do the door panels as you'll have to take them off, it's easier to do them both at the same time.Once installed you'll notice it right away. Vibrations will be more damped and while it wont turn your tin can vehicle into a luxury vehicle, it will be much quieter - you'll keep staring at the speedo and wondering if its reading wrong when it says 75 when your ears think its 40."
79860,"I am writing this review while watching the movie, so I guess it says a lot about it. With the people involved in making this movie, this is such a disappointment.The style was directly copied from the director of Sin City & 300. , but the story line and the actors don't manage to carry out such a tricky atmosphere. I am not even sure there is any story line per se, which probably does not help. The actors don't seem convinced either, which probably explains why they are not convincing.If it comes for free, give it a try and fast forward if necessary. I regret paying for this rental."
79861,"I enjoyed the first two seasons, but this is- by far- the best. We see the characters struggle - we watch them grow and change in the face of unspeakable horror. Incredibly well acted."
79862,"Maybe it's the formula of every episode, or maybe it's just that the show has gone on too long and has gotten tired -- whatever it is, I just don't enjoy it like I did early on. I do continue to like &#34;Jane&#34; and I hope the actress finds another series where she can display her talents, but the other actors are only so-so. I would have given the first couple of seasons five stars."
79863,"you really have to have a lot of wind inside you to play these harmonicas, they are great but you really got to blow hard to get them rocking, adding distortion to them helps to brings out a better sound live or in the studio. These fit my budget and plus you get EVERY KEY you need for any song......WOW... Hohner has been around forever, well constructed instrument and very reliable company."
79864,"This is an adjustable pot hanger that will work on most railings, decks, etc.It definitely does not have a high-end look, and I do wonder at its durability, but it'll work for most situations.If you need a lot of these it could get pricey."
79865,"It feels a lot like a Master Piece Theater series, only it is set in Ireland. We really enjoyed each season, and it now has my wife talking about a return trip to the Emerald Isle. How could I not give the series five stars?"
79866,"Centurion, a Roman empire epic set in Britain in 117 AD, has many of those qualities we see in the best of this genre: A plot line as empty as Gladiator's; self-polishing abs breast plates for all officers; and Life of Brian's attention to historical accuracy. It adds blood arcing for some distance into the sky when a lance meets an eyeball. And there are two feral lady barbarians, one blond with what looks like bad teeth (Aeron, played by Axelle Carolyn) and one brunette, whose teeth look just fine, as do her breasts (Etain, played silently by Olga Kurylenko). The brunette fancies skins when she goes out hunting Romans in the deep winter forest and scanty skins when in a hut.Centurion, in other words, is as silly as they come. Briefly, it's about an attempt by the Ninth Legion, led by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West), to march north into what is now Scotland and eliminate the Pict threat. Evidently Virilus never read up on the fate of Publius Quinctilius Varus, no general but a good administrator. Marching deep into the Teutoburg Forest in what is now Germany, he and his three legions were attacked by combined Germanic tribes. Varus committed suicide in the middle of the battle. His three legions disintegrated. Probably 20,000 or more Roman soldiers died compared to a handful of barbarians.General Virilus, virile and confidant, who didn't read his history, marches his men into the thick forests of Pictland.  Flash forward to the next day. Virilus is in chains in the squalid camp of the Pict king. Most of his men have been slaughtered. Later, a handful of survivors led by Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) try to rescue him. No luck. The Pict king's young son is killed and the general dies in a forced fight with Etain. The seven Romans escape and head south with a handful of Pict hunters (led by Etain and Aeron) hot on their trail. Pict hunters die one by one; the Roman seven almost die one by one.What's good about Centurion? The make-up and the set-designer. Picts look as dirty and flea-bitten as their filthy encampments. Most of the Romans look as filthy as the Picts. There are stunning, craggy, shivering cold scenes of the Highlands.What lacks in Centurion? Characters we can give even a small hoot for. Most of the time we can't remember one from another. Fassbender seems to be a rising star, but all he's called upon to do in this movie is fight, run monotonously and look tired. Only one actor in the cast stands out as tough and smart, and that is that fine actor Liam Cunningham. He's made a lot of drek, but look for him inShooting the Past,Dog SoldiersandThe Wind That Shakes the Barley. The movie's battle scenes, particularly Virilus' march north, is shot only to show slashing swords and more spurts of blood. There's no way to follow the battles. A plot also is lacking. The first third is an excuse for gore. The last two-thirds is an excuse for gore and long-distance running. The roles of Etain and Aeron are a sop to the 18-29-year-old audience the director seems to care most for.Centurion is not a movie. It's a mediocre comic book for all those who love abs-enhancing armor, horsehair helmet crests and the inspiring National Geographic maps showing the Roman Empire at its greatest extent."
79867,"These Bosch Icon Windshield Wiper Blades work great and were very easy to install on my Chrysler Town & County minivan. My car needed these 20A size on the passenger side andBosch 26A ICON Wiper Blade - 26"", Pack of 1on the driver side, which I confirmed using the Amazon ""Find Parts"" tool that shows up at the top of most automotive accessory pages.These blades looked flimsy compared to the ones it replaced since they do not have the ridged support bracket, but my concerns were groundless as they fit and performed very well, leaving not streaks and not ""squeaking"". Having never replaced my own wiper blades before, I went to the Bosch site to watch the helpful installation video found at ""[...]"", you will have to replace the ""(dot)""s with "".""s since Amazon doesn't allow embedding actual links in reviews.These exceeded my exceptions in both functionality and ease of installation!Highly Recommended!CFH"
79868,"Resolution (Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, 2012)It has been slightly less than a week since I finished watching Resolution, and I still haven't quite figured out how I feel about the movie's final sequence. It's either brilliant or stupid, and I'm still balancing 50/50 on that line. Which is not to say that the rest of the movie isn't wonderful, which is why I decided to table that question for the sake of writing this review; be aware that you may end up loathing the last five minutes of the movie, but the ninety that get you there are well worth it.Plot: Chris Daniels (Machine Head's Vinny Curran) is on an epic meth bender as the film opens, shooting at birds, playing with his dog, etc. We get the feeling this is not his first (this is confirmed about fifteen minutes into the film). Mike Danube (Ghost Game's Peter Cilella), Chris' best friend&#8212;in fact, Chris' last remaining friend&#8212;heads up to the cabin and, after a bit of subterfuge, handcuffs Chris to a pipe in the wall. Meth withdrawal takes a week and, Mike says, if Chris gets it all out of his system and then decides to go back to it, Mike will leave Chris to his own devices, but if Chris decides at that point to go into rehab, Mike will help him out. For the first twenty-five minutes of the movie, it's abut two guys in a cabin, one of whom is trying various tricks to get a hit. And then...things get weird.I wrote those last sentences a week ago and I still don't know how I feel about that last sequence. I have read easily a dozen different interpretations of it, and I recognize that the fact that you can even get a dozen different interpretations of it out of it, even if some of them don't stand up to too much scrutiny, is in itself a good thing. The one that makes the most sense to me is kind of brilliant, but I can't shake the feeling that had it been handled just a little bit differently, it might have confused fewer folks. Yes, I realize the contradiction inherent in this paragraph; see why this movie has been smacking me in the head for a week? Regardless, however, the movie turns on the very good performances of Curran and Cilella; even after this stops being the two-person thriller the first third-ish of the movie sets up, the movie is still very much focused on these two guys, with other folks providing background color and a bit of information to help the astute viewer sort out the ending, or so I understand from some of the celluloid archaeologists who have concocted the more elaborate hypotheses about its ending. And even if the ending leaves you befuddled and arguing with your friends into the night or frantically scouring the internet to find out what it all means, the two-person-thriller aspect of the movie, after a slow start (this is not necessarily a bad thing; the opening montage is half hilarious and half heartbreaking), works like a charm. You want to give this one a look. *** "
79869,"The Good:  This is a great power washer.  I bought it to replace a 2000psi electric power washer that could just never cut it around the property.  This washer does everything you could ever want to do on an average residential property.  I have used it to clean mold off of the side of the house (vinal siding), clean the driveway and sidewalk, and stone walls.  I also bought the Generac Sidewalk cleaner attachment and the two combined are better than anything.  The hose is long enough for my purposes, the attachment heads are conveniently stored on the handle and the actual washer wand stores nicely in the handle as well.  The engine is easy to start up and the gas tank hold quite a lot of gas.The Bad:  I wish the hose was a little more flexible.  It is a relatively inflexible plastic.  If it could act more like a garden hose, it would prevent kinking and bending."
79870,I love love love everything Christopher Guest does. This show was funny and heartfelt. This show also made me seek out the documentary that Nina Conti did.  She is a wonderful ventriloquist.
79871,"Definitely a must have for the Fringe fan.  Sadly, the storyline had nowhere to go after Season 4, although Season 5 was appropriate and had some real surprises."
79872,"Contrary to what Amazon says here, these plugs did fit my 2000 GMC Sierra 4X4 with a 4.8L. They were not that hard to replace and I highly recommend using Anti-Sieze when installing these. Great plugs and you can never go wrong with ACDelco for your GM vehicle. As always, if you are not sure whether or not these will fit your applicatoin, give your local dealership a call and they can verify. Thanks Amazon for always carrying everything I need to keep my truck on the road.Here is some further information from ACDelco regarding these plugs and a new replacement plug ([...] Although it does state (for my model) to use the newer plug for my application, I chose to stay with these because of modifications I have done to my truck."
79873,"I love B&D; tools and have a variety of 18v tools.  I never really owned many gardening tools and decided to buy this and give it a whirl...no pun intended. :-)  The package comes with 2 18v batteries, a spindle of twine, and the hog it self.  Charged one of the batteries for 18 hours or so and off I went to get rid of weeds.  PERFECT....this worked for about 30 minutes on full power and 15-20 minutes on half power with one full  battery.I was impressed...as the 18v electric broom died in 20 minutes...I have now used it about a dozen times and my results are exactly the same....  Replacement twine is avail on Amazon and  your your local big store... :-)5/5 - Great Product, Great Value...especially for us beginners."
79874,"I've been checking out some of the other Pilot episodes.  Thought others would be good, but was underwhelmed so far.  This show is the real thing.  I hope this gets picked up.The dialogue is great and the satire is spot on.  Finally a well thought out and executed pilot.Thanks.  Alpha House.  Hope the other pilots take notes from this one."
79875,"It was my fault not to check out it's measurements before purchase. But it's not the reason why I drop by one star. The reason is it's not designed properly.Since people stand and sing, this extendable table mic stand is still too short for people taller than 6 feet. I'm 5'11'' I can barely reach the microphone when I stand still.Also, it's way to tall if you want to sit and use it as a PC mic.As a result, I feel I'm  either too tall or too short...Build quality is fine and its price can not get beaten. Overall a four stars product IMO."
79876,This was one of the only things that I've found that actually seems to really work as far as moles and voles.  I used it just as instructed and within 2 days I noticed less mole activity in my yard.  I'll continue to use and hopefully will eventually eliminate the problem altogether.
79877,"I bought 3 different high rated LED lamps to replace 1411 tungsten lamps and of the three this produced the best light, both in terms of brightness and in having a clean white light. This will be my LED of choice for the additional 1411 bulbs I will be replacing."
79878,"The other reviewers are absolutely right! This series is phenomenal, its got everything.You know, I expected a bunch of redneck, backward, unsophisticated Cajuns that were rippedfrom society about 50 years ago, man was I wrong. These guys are very bright, know theirbusiness, and use very clever methods to trap and catch their prey and have learned how tomaximize their profits in a short 30 day window where they are allowed to hunt gators. Imean these guys are so relentless one of the cast (Troy) even caught 39 gators in one day!The trick is to get them to market before the Louisiana sun spoils the catch, and for bigcash.One of my favorite episodes was when ""Junior"" agreed to take on a visitor from Italy, aclothing designer, who wanted to go on a hunt. This was pretty funny, as they just calledhim Itally Guy (thats how they spelled it), but he didn't cause too much trouble other thanthe catch was about 1/2 of what they normally expected. Anyway, at the end of the day Juniortold Itally Guy ""get the hell off my property"" in a very nice way and I expect we wont seehim again in future episodes.One of the things that makes this show so good is the sense of urgency, these guys aren'tplaying around and here's why...... at the start of the season, each hunter is allocateda certain number of ""tags"" for each gator they catch. When they run out of tags, theirseason is over. If they don't use all their tags, then the state cuts their allotment oftags for the next season. That makes for great TV!After watching Season 1, I have the ultimate respect for all these men, their families, andthe film crews that brought us this unique series. I've always loved visiting Louisiana, butthis is a part of the state very few ever see. I still hate LSU, but I love this show. lol"
79879,All I got was a preview or interview of what the season was about. I didn't get to the third season at all. What's up with that?
79880,"I'm going to give this show 5 stars, because I love it! Not only do I love this show, my 18 month old daughter loves it too! She recites the movie from front to back! This show is a lot of fun to watch, and I like the fact that it teaches young children manners. I will recommend this show to families with children, ages 0 and up. Lol. I'm 30 and I'll watch this show over and over."
79881,"A movie that defies both facile description and easy categorization - is it an anarchic comedy, a sci-fi thriller, an apocalyptic, end-times parody? - ""John Dies at the End"" plays like a bad acid-trip caught on film. The Don Coscarelli scenario, based on the novel by Don Wong, focuses on two buddies, Dave and John, who become unwittingly involved with time-tripping, mind-reading, astral projection and a whole host of creep crawly creatures after each is injected with a strange black liquid given to them by a Jamaican mentalist. But do David and John have what it takes to enter the trans-dimensional portal and save the world from the evil forces attempting to cross over from the other side?Don't fret if you can't make heads or tails out of this manic and amusing tribute to the surreal and the absurd; instead, just sit back and enjoy the ride as director Coscarelli hurls us from one bizarre experience to the next. And you'd have to look far and wide to find better companions for the duration than Chase Williamson and Rob Mayes, two talented youngsters who not only slip right into the anarchic spirit of the enterprise but provide the grounding in reality that is so crucial to making this kind of thing work."
79882,"Put this in a Envoy XUV with 17,500 original miles hoping to maybe squeeze a little MPG's based on the other reviews I read here on Amazon.  What a crock !  Did nothing remotely close to lowering temp.  Just lowered my pocket book by $28 and change because I bought 2 bottles based on Purple's rep. I had e-mailed telling me 1oz per quart of capacity.  Figured I would then put the rest in my wife's Accord.  Temp is actually higher !  I e-mailed rep back and here is what he said :I'm sorry that you having noticed a temperature drop as of yet, but Purple Ice will not cause an increase in operating temperature.  Was this vehicle running hot to begin with?  If so, was the root cause investigated?No radiator additive will cause an a thermostatically controlled cooling system to run consistently colder than the thermostat set-point.  The thermostat is there to help the engine warm up quickly be restricting coolant flow until the coolant reaches a certain temperature.  That is its function.  If the coolant goes below that set-point the thermostat closes and the coolant begins to increase in temperature until the t-stat opens again.If you were not having overheating problems, why did you purchase and use a product that is intended to alleviate overheating problems?  The product works as exactly advertised.  If you would like the vehicle to run colder that the current t-stat set-point you may try installing a cooler t-stat.  Purple Ice will help you vehicle achieve this lower temperature after the mechanical restrictions to such an end are removed.In my opinion FALSE ADVERTISING and a SNAKE OIL product BEWARE."
79883,"I really can't rate it yet. I've only seen one episode and right now I'm busy watching several years worth of Criminal Minds.  I might warm up to it, but I never did like the mastermind behind the scenes pulling the strings of an unwilling puppet idea.  People who love the Superman saga will like this one, I think, because the main protagonist, around which the whole story is based, possesses super-human powers bestowed upon him by some futuristic, mind altering mad scientist.  Although there is much techno babble jargon in the script, so far, anyway, I still think I see the cardboard cutout underneath of a cartoon character.  Nothing wrong with that if you like watching superheroes battling impossible odds and conquering all, and beautiful women in equally impossibly tight pants and low cut blouses."
79884,The best series I think I have ever seen. The writing and acting and story was addictive. I miss it.
79885,Great use to hold a guitar pick and to use to find your keys to open the door with.My son likes it and uses it often
79886,This is a fun show there is something new all the time and a great story that follows every week. Refreshing to know that new is still achievable in TV.
79887,"My only complaint is that it is sometimes hard to get the top off and to stay open while trying to refill the feeder. We also had some animal bend and break off one of our suet holders. Since they are only attached at the top it was easy for the animal (we suspect a racoon) to bend the suet holder up and run off with the suet cake. Eventually the holder snapped off. Minimal complaint though, overall we really like the look of this feeder, it holds a lot of seed, allows multiple birds to feed at one time and doesnt leave that much of a mess on the ground. Pretty sturdy construction, has held up after many severe storms here in Michigan."
79888,Very nice. Great acting and storyline. Instant hit! Bring it on please. This could really be something really really special.
79889,This is a fun show to watch. It is the same kind of show as Prison Break or 24. Very suspenseful and eventful.
79890,"the dome concept captivates me but the characters do not.  I find myself watching this show and disliking it yet unable to look away.  The only half way likeable charactersfor me so far are Barbie and the boy math whiz.  The story is definitely going to have to accelerate with some drama or at least reveal some things because right now, if all Chester's Mill perished I wouldn't be that moved."
79891,"There is a great balance in the writing and performance of this show that actually gives it the feel of a finely performed orchestra, not just the backdrop of one. From the pilot, one can understand how the character development and relationship will be instrumental, as well as the musical talents displayed. Well worth watching and following."
79892,"I didn't expect to enjoy this show but having watched the first season, I was very happy to continue the &#34;Dixie&#34; experience in season 2.This is so watchable with some good believable characters and story lines.With so many &#34;dark&#34; viewing options available to be able to sit back and relax with this light, entertaining and wholesome TV is a wonderful treat. I'm very much looking forward to season 3."
79893,"The film starts out as a great psychological thriller. Cara Harding (Julianne Moore) is a psychologist like her father (Jeffrey DeMunn). She does not believe in multiple personalities. Her dad finds a case in David/Adam (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) that challenges her. She investigates the lives they claim to be, only to discover the impossible.What was unfortunate was that this film moves from a clever thriller to a less than stellar horror film. I enjoyed the mystery aspect of the film. Cara's attempts to prove Dave/Adam as a hoax, blowing up in her face, time and time again was great. Too bad they couldn't wrap it up. Still it is well worth a view.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity."
79894,This is one of those mysteries that takes so many twists and turns that you stay glued to the screen and try to get sight of the ONE who really did it!! I recommend this to any one who really likes the challenge of a good mystery!! A 5 star @ the least!!
79895,So many tones to choose from with the variable frequency Eq and a nice range of distortion makes this a killer deal.
79896,"What?  Is it over?  What was it about?  I think I fell asleep.  Yawn.  Um, it was boring.  It was shallow.  It was vulgar.  No more AMAZON ORIGINALS FOR ME.  I don't understand all the positive ratings.  These shows seem to be written by a graduating class in Series Writing where they were given a formula and told to go out there and shoot a pilot.Here's your formula:  SHOCK, SEX, GREAT SCENERY, BEAUTIFUL YOUNG ACTORS, STIR IN SOME TOP TALENT, THROW IT ON THE WALL and SEE WHAT STICKS."
79897,"This fertilizer is working quite nicely with my flowers, which is saying quite a bit as I have a tendency to kill plants. I wasn't sure about getting a product with a nutrient blend so specific to just one type of flower because it it does seem rather narrow. However, in my case, at least, I realized that this was the ideal product because I don't know what the heck I'm doing in the garden, and I'm intimidated by gardening advice that tells you to test your soil and all that. This product allows me to sort of plant it and forget it. It's my kind of gardening."
79898,"Bought it for using Danelectro mini amp, so I don't need to worry about the battery.  It works perfectly as an adaptor should be, & you won't have any surprise by its performance. :)  two stars out because of comparing the price with the mini amp (less than $20), the adaptor is pricy ($8.50), but it still saves me $$ for the long runs."
79899,"I like these but not really for what they were designed for, I use them on top of the soil to keep dirt splash down and keep bugs out. They work pretty well and look nice."
79900,Great show always full of action and on the go. Its not a show for kids and some adults may find it offensive but if you can get past that you wont want to miss the next episodes.
79901,"I first purchased this one on Amazon about a year ago, and it was like $6, and a couple of days ago, I needed it, and couldn't find it in my garage.  I ran to walmart to see what they had and they had this exact kit for $1.94.  MUCH cheaper than here on Amazon.  I love Amazon, but sometimes they have higher prices than you can find elsewhere."
79902,Fantastic ensamble cast with a wonderful female lead. Stories are character lead which I like. This is a can't miss series
79903,"I am looking for quality, but inexpensive, microfiber cloths that I can use to detail the car and clean the house. These fit the bill as I can use these in my daily cleaning.  16 x 16 is a great size for quad-folding.  Still debating in my mind vs. using 12 x 16 cloths.  Need to remove the tags from these before use and may want to wash first to remove manufacturing lint."
79904,"com'on now elijah wood in a horror, he doesnt let you down, a good actor doing a passionate job, gotta see"
79905,The parents had a lot of issues in these episodes and it took away from the kids but still a good show with great dancing
79906,"THE SHRINE is a dark, bleak horror film that Lovecraft himself would enjoy. Two reporters and their photographer venture into rural Poland, in order to find out what happened to a missing American tourist. They soon find themselves plunged into a hellish nightmare of cults, curses, and demons. This is one brutal film, where nothing is sacred, and no one is safe! I was pleasantly surprised by the progression of events, starting out light, easing into creepy, then on to intense, and finally shifting into all-out insane! The final confrontation / revelation is an absolute brain-mulcher! Highest recommendation..."
79907,"Wonderful show,especially to get hubby to sit still on a lazy day.Some old favorites are missing this season and the homo boys still are nerve racking catching up all the babies then wondering why there are no gators.LoL.."
79908,"It makes restringing way easier it's pretty stable and sturdy. It will work on pretty much any guitar. So far iv used it on my 6,7 electrics and my Taylor acoustic."
79909,This was great to use on my Subaru when I changed the transmission fluid.  It fit well and I did not spill any when I poured in over 6 quarts after draining the transmission fluid.
79910,"This series features a young man viewers want to see succeed. He literally pulls himself &#34;up by his bootstraps&#34;, but not only for himself, but for the person who raised him. The two main characters play against each other so that each is likable, but Patrick J. Adams is the one that catches at your heart. &#34;Suits&#34; is a great series with humor and the other parts of life that aren't so pleasant--greed, control, love of money--tests that make us keep watching and enjoying."
79911,"With such a strong ending--sad to see one of the best shows end, but thanks for the ride!  If you haven't seen this, watch it from the beginning--you'll be glad you did."
79912,My wife and I both love Dallas. We've watched the show since its inception in 1978. There is always something unexpected!
79913,Simon Baker and the supporting cast including his father Dabney Coleman were good in their performances and I was addicted to this series and pulled into the good writing/acting and storyline
79914,"I bought this in September 2011 on Amazon, and it's still performing flawlessly after more than two years of moderate use.There's already lot's of reviews of this charger, so I'll be brief and to the point.What I like:It's never failed to start a car with a dead battery. Just set it for 200 amps, let it sit for a couple minutes and crank the car up. The cables are generally long enough to accomplish whatever job needs done.What I don't like:Chintzy wheels could be better.Battery tester is basically a joke... it doesn't give an exact voltage and maxes out at 12.7 volts. I'd like to have had an option for timed charge and a sensor that would charge to full capacity and then go to &#34;trickle&#34; mode.I'm giving this charger four stars in spite of its shortcomings because it has worked flawlessly for over two years, and it was reasonably priced when I bought it. I feel comfortable recommending this charger to anyone who need a good battery charger, but would make sure I told them of the weaknesses of this charger."
79915,"I've used a few of these items this year and have been pleased with the performance. As I said in other reviews, durable and does the job. Great at the sales price but I would not pay the full price--it just seems to be over-priced for what it is. Still, as far as the product itself, it's lightweight and easy to use. Not much else to say really.NOTE: Since this item came out the price has come down SUBSTANTIALLY, making it a more feasible alternative to heavy stones and messy ..."
79916,Easy to install. Fits perfect and allows you to attach your visor too!Great price and I would recommend it.Not a full face one but does the job. The tint is not real dark but does the job.Get yourself one.
79917,"Based on the ratings, this seemed to not have worked for a whole bunch of people but it's worked for me.I baited the trap as per instructions with peanut butter and set the trap. When the mouse was caught we looked at it carefully. The bait door bulged out a little but was not open. The mouse was definitely dead because it was not moving even when we opened the bait door to confirm that the occupant was not alive. It was nice because unlike most other traps you see some of the mouse, but with this one it completely hides it, even the tail. I'd buy this again, and it's cheaper than most other full cover traps."
79918,"Used this on my 2001 Honda Civic EX Coupe. Headlights were pretty glazed (&#34;white looking&#34;). This took me about half an hour to do properly, but the headlights look significantly clearer now. The difference is dramatic. Even using a drill, prepare for some physical exertion - holding the drill steady as you move it back and forth across the lens, and exerting pressure on it. It's worth it though - I am ordering a second one for my s/o. Highly recommended!"
79919,"Although I agree with some points made by the one and two-star reviewers, overall I think this was an interesting and creative look at what the world might be like if this were to happen.  Definitely not fine art, but I've seen much much worse.  Loved the actress who played the little girl.  She was the best among the cast."
79920,"I bought this to replace an old mitt I had which was falling apart. This works really well, especially getting off stains from tree saps, bird droppings, bug spatter, etc. Great bang for your buck."
79921,I love these ghost hunting shows.  This is another one worth watching.  It is scientifically done enough to make the evidence interesting.  The only issue I have is with their timing. They do EVP sessions and then seemingly play them back right away...the whole time I'm thinking &#34;what if the ghost has more to say?&#34;  Which is probably silly and a matter of editing.  But I'm just saying...
79922,"This chamois is pretty much the same product as what we've all come to know as the &#34;Absorber&#34; which was released many years ago as the first commercially pushed drying product. It does soak up water well, but tends to leave small droplets on the car. I actually prefer not using a chamois on the car, and using Adams Great White Drying towel (http://www.amazon.com/Adams-Great-White-Drying-Towel/dp/B001QVI57M). It produces a much better drying effect and you'd be amazed at how much it can soak up.As some of the marketing pictures for the Amazon Chamois refer to, I may leave these around the kitchen for cleanups and maybe one on the boat."
79923,"THE STORY LINE, ACTING BY LEAD CHARACTERS AND SUPPORTING CAST IS UNIFORMLY EXCELLENT. I WILL BE SORRY TO SEE THIS SERIES COME TO AN END."
79924,"We enjoyed the scenery, the believable situations and the thought-provoking solutions.  Very informative and helpful.  We look forward to more."
79925,"After spending $15 on this at Autozone, I figured I would try Amazon to see if I could find another cheaper! Of course, a week later my second bulb went out, and it was time for a replacement. The light is bright, not too yellow, and so far the bulb hasn't shorted out...These can be found cheaper, but with free 2-day shipping I can't complain!"
79926,This show really plays on your heart strings.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this season and hope there will be more to come in the future.
79927,Fits well in my my cars 12 adapter. Display section swivels 180 degrees for convenient viewing.Large easy to read numbers and backlit LCD display.3 LED Warning lights have 2 modes:one mode for battery (motor off) andone mode for alternator (motoring running). Very useful since you don't need to know the actual voltages for a healthy battery or charging system.ACCURATE. I checked the voltage reading with a professional calibrated voltmeter and it was within 0.01 volts. (Surprised me it was that accurate)Note: the LCD backlight and 1 led is always on and are bright. This may distracting to some people driving at night.Very happy with this unit. I would buy it again and recommend it to a friend.
79928,this is a really good wax. it gives a deep gloss and shine. It goes on easy and comes off easy without flaking.very good value.
79929,"This is a rare sort of film. Its visuals are stunning - including a long trek through a jungle at night and a woman who has intercourse with a water pond. It is metaphysical. As our hero approaches death, he is joined by his dead wife who is visible not only to him but to his younger siblings as well. He is visited also by a son who is now a red-eyed, shaggy-haired beast. Do not expect continuity, just revel in the visuals as they are given to you, and think about it later. This is a truly original film. Watch and enjoy."
79930,"My 2 1/2 yr old granddaughter who is only allowed limited TV time, is quite the connoisseur of children's shows.  Blues Clues is one of her favorites, and explains to me what is going on, and which host is on the show (apparently Steve went away to college)."
79931,"I received this grow light stand with light within two days of ordering it.  Assembly took my husband ten minutes for stand and light fixture,  He's a carpenter so he can easily put things together.  ""This is easy, it just takes common sense!"" he commented.  For someone like me who needs step-by-step instructions though, it may have taken me a bit longer.  There are instructions for the light fixture assembly but he didn't even open those.He noted that the light fixture is slightly uneven on top (the hooks aren't evenly placed) but that is because an inch is needed for the electrical cord once the light is hanging from the stand.  So don't let the uneven hook mounts fool you.  Once the lamp is hanging there is very little wiggle room for the lamp to dangle.And what a bright light it is.  My little 10""x20"" germination set almost seems too small!  Depending on how far away the light hangs from the seed box (the distance is easily adjusted with the white cord) this light could easily provide light for a seed box twice the size with regular rotations of the seed boxes.  After 12 hours ofnon-stop burning, the lamp did not get hot.The stand is sturdy.  But what amazes me is the brightness of the light.  Just one lamp in the dining room provided more light than a night light at night.  I may have to find a more inconspicuous place for this thing.All I have to see now is how long the provided lamp works.  This stand is a tad expensive but if it provided the medium to grow seedlings evenly, it's worth the price."
79932,"Okay so I'm sure everyone has their preferences. I haven't tried everyone on the market - but of the ones I have, these are the best. I try not touch my exterior of my car with anything, but if I have to these are the only ones I trust. They are the softest and thickest Microfiber I have ever owned. I use them more regularly for wiping down my interior, windows, and mirrors. They wash well, and there's no left over tag bits or rough parts on the towel. Meguiar always has great products, IMO."
79933,"The Italian Key [HD] - This is a light-hearted mystery romance. We watched it during an evening in when we needed some down time.  It is a movie that is easy to watch, challenges enough not to exhaust when you are tired, keeps your attention and is an ok story. It would not be in Oscar contention, but it's good for an evening at home."
79934,I use this cable to run a extra line from microphone podiums to a zoom H1. This adapter has never failed me and has been instrumental in capturing quality audio at live events. I own several of these and love them.I highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional. Also check out Hosa's sinlge XLR to double XLR splitter.
79935,The unit is certainly getting a workout after the wet summer.  I have not had any issues with the unit becoming clogged.  I used a timer to save the unit from operating during the day to limit electricity use and save the bulb life.  An unintended consequence of this unit was that I was able to light up a fairly dark area in our yard that gives an added sense of security.  I would recommend.
79936,"I don't understand other reviews, this is a 0 star movie, but I had to put 1.  The acting is bad, what happens in the story is bad (at leaast 1 stupid decision by every character in the movie that make you go ""oh, come on"").This might just be the worst movie I've ever seen."
79937,"Wonderful series.  Morse was exceptional and Lewisfollows in the same manner.  English drama has class.No excessive blood and guts, and only innuendo onvarying topics.  Refreshing!"
79938,Great show. Saw it on tv  about half way thru season. Top show. Funny. Something just about everyone likes. Good quality disc.
79939,great stuff to have for a great price&#8230;i like it! highly recommend to everyone must have for those who loves to play guitar.
79940,"This series does a good job of combining a historical perspective with drama.  The depiction of the Vikings combines the old stereotypes with some of the more sympathetic realities, like the fact that the Vikings (as well as others in the area and time) saw women as important members of society and allowed them some power.  Still, it's hard to sympathize with the characters, as the protagonists live to murder and steal from others.  Their victims don't seem to show any more honor, which I guess is intended to make the murderers seem more human, but it doesn't really work.  Rather, it leaves you feeling like nobody in the story is anything other than spineless or bloodthirsty.  However, if you can play the cultural relativist for a bit, and if you enjoy some gratuitous violence, you'll probably get a kick out of this."
79941,"""Main Street"" is a small independent film and must have breezed through the theater chains. I don't even remember seeing it advertised. Yet it has a stellar cast with Colin Firth (doing a Texas drawl that works unless you know him well) and Ellen Burstyn (as an older southern woman - a part I can easily see Barbara Bel Geddes doing in the 70s).As an ""independent film"" the acting is more important than the story line (one of the last - if not the last - by Horton Foote). It's about Durham, NC and - despite the title - you only see the ""Main Street"" in some set shots at the beginning. All the other scenes take place inside houses or the police station or City Hall.I also do not want to reveal the plot as much of the pleasure of this film is discovering it yourself. There are a few separate stories going on and some, not all, become intertwined. To give more would be a spoiler alert, though I will say there are some continuity issues I had with a police officer doing research in the local library. That scene is left hanging and did bother me.This is not a GREAT film by any means but it was good to spend 90 minutes with these folks. I enjoyed the score too, though some of the musical ""cues"" hinted at action or events a bit too soon.The bonus features are minimal: There are three deleted scenes - two of  them show just crying women - and they total under 3 minutes! The ""A Day Behind the Scenes"" featurette show none of the cast and in its 5-minute length identify each of the technical crew.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
79942,"The first season had an intriguing plot line. Now it just seems silly. Poor acting doesn't make it any better. Big Jim is just a bully, and the others kinda go along."
79943,This is a great product.  You can see exactly what goes thru it and will know when the tanks are clean.
79944,"Breaking Bad TV series is an outstanding piece of work from the cast and crew. Kudos to the director for making this one of the very best TV series that I have ever watched in my life. I rarely praise any TV drama but honestly this TV series is one of the most addicting series ever. The work is technically perfect! Everything is well done from acting to sound effects to storytelling. There is something for everyone in the household to watch and enjoy.Warning! After watching this series, you will find most other popular TV series dull and boring! I am confident that within less than 10 mins into the season 1 episode 1 show you will get addicted and cannot stop watching the series.Excellent! 5 Stars!"
79945,"this monster weighs nearly 2 lbs. is 8 inches long by 3-1/2 inches diameter. it destroyed a perfectly good hose as the weight and unwieldiness of it opened up the hose itself at the nozzle connection. i am going to donate mine to the fire department, maybe they can use it."
79946,Yes!  I finally have a tuner that fits right on my guitar headstock!  It never needs to be removed!  It's accurate.  It's easy to use.  It's low-profile.  Highly recommended.
79947,"This Project Runway spinoff stresses all the bad elements of its parent, including the principal one: Angst over Art. In the original Runway, Tim Gunn mentors the designers, who often spat and denigrate each other. Here, Gunn mentors three past Runway participants, who then act as mentor to their own small group of designers. So now the designers can spat, the mentors can spat, and the clothes get moved even farther to the back of the stage. Indeed, Project Runway is all about personal validation, rather than validation of one's art, and it wouldn't be part of the Runway franchise if we didn't have tears and self-pity and pretensions of hipness, which we get in spades this time around. There's an episode of disgusting bullying by people who themselves claim to have been bullied (including one of the mentors), as well as a moment involving a confession of attempted suicide that seems to be nothing but a pathetic bid for sympathy to avoid elimination. Tim Gunn, who has now become a caricature of himself, acquiesces in the bullying, not at all to his credit. Then there are the judges, a second rate trio if there ever was one, including one loud-mouthed person who is nothing but smoke and mirrors. I won't divulge the ultimate winners, of course, but I will say that the show partially redeems itself by selecting correctly at the very end. If you enjoy the slummy aspects of Runway, this will appeal to you. If you hate the fact that Runway is like professional wrestling, then you might want to steer clear."
79948,"We are rural with quarter acres vegetable plots so deer are a big problem.  We have five feet of electical fencingParmak Super Energizer 5 Low Impedance 110/120 Volt 50 Mile Range Electric Fence Controller SE5running around our garden but our neighbor's garden doesn't have a fence and his beans were getting hit hard by the deer.Because you can't spray it on food, my brother dumped the entire container of Deer Off in a bucket (said it looks and smells like chicken wing sauce made with butter and hot sauce) added a little water, and soaked rope in it.  He then strung the rope around the garden. Voila - no more deer.He just ran the rope this week and it rains daily so I don't know how long it will last.  I'll add an addendum.Dinged the product a star because of the price but will give it back if it really does last 90 days."
79949,"Fairly straight forward movie. Not a lot of sub-plot here. But the story unfolds very well. Tension in several scenes works very well. The action scenes get a bit gory, so brace yourself. Good movie, watch it."
79950,"These are first ever nozzles that I have had that ""do not"" leak.  I highly recommend them.  I use mine for hosing down a couple of patio covers.  My other nozzle always gave me a bath."
79951,I bought this for my acoustic. Bought another one for my electric Schecter Hellraiser Solo 6. Holds my bass guitars easily as well.
79952,Enjoy the show.  Nothing more to say.  We'd like to be able to watch every episode with our Prime membership.
79953,"I have not been a big fan of Matt Smith and I am glad to see him go, but this is one of the more interesting episodes of his. Happy to add it to part of my collection as I have everything available for this last fifty years."
79954,"When buying a new car, they always fill the fluid tank with the regular blue washer fluid. I can either extract all of that fluid and replace with Rain-X fluid, or use the additive. I found the additive to be similar to the Rain-X treatment, but possibly more concentrated. I poured 4 oz into my fluid tank, and it worked. Water droplets tend to sheet away at speeds above 45 mph. Is it better than the full treatment? Of course not, but I found that using just the Rain-X wiper fluid was sufficient, and this additive is only going to be used until I consume the original fluid. After that, I would start using the orange Rain-X wiper fluid year-round.I didn't have any issues with streaking, water marks, or anything negative. This additive works.Overall: 5/5 stars"
79955,I've watched this series from beginning to end about a dozen times now.  It seems that I never tire of watching it.
79956,"Well, am baffled that there was not a second season... Granted we do get a grip on who is pulling the strings and about who truly is initiating and benefiting from 'terrorism' .... Still, there was still much thread to unravel... and the season could have added more twists and turns... I mean come on the world is such a mess today that all you need for a good story is a pen and a blank page....  argh too close to the vest perhaps (?) for some naive souls who rather watch desperate housewives.... than 'live' an intense questioning of what is government today, or who is truly in charge 'out there'....  It is an unusual directing style, slow yet gripping.. Argh, those were the days when writing, acting and directing meant something.... Helas!"
79957,Best of the Pilots - Good to see eric overmyer on this project - can certainly see his influences from his work on The Wire and Treme.  Also great to see a few of the Actors from the Wire!
79958,There are a couple of tv shows with music successfully included in a drama and/or comedy show.  It always seemed to me they go downhill when the singing stops.  This pilot goes downhill from the opening song and either stays there or goes further down.  The songs and singing were mediocre.  The acting and writing was amateurish.  I am embarrassed for Bebe Neurwirth.  She deserves better but should also have known better than to allow herself to be dragged into this muck.  Perhaps out of work older actors have to take jobs beneath their skill level just like a lot of other workers in this economy. Sad.
79959,Watched the entire thing and was very happy with the program.  I will also be ordering additional seasons until I catch up.
79960,"I had used Elixer strings for several years on both 6 and 12 string guitars. Somehow, I had gravitated over to other brands including Martin and D'Addario.  I got a set of these strings as well as the Phosphor Bronze design through the Vine program and chose to this set out on a Seagull Artist Mosaic rather than on a Taylor, Martin or Gibson. The result is outstanding - So much so, that I am beginning to restring all 7 of my acoustic and acoustic-electric guitars with Elixers again.I have also tried the new Phosphor Bronze strings in this series on a Gibson and had fine results.  Because I did not use both sets of strings on the same guitar, it is not possible for me to really compare/contract the. These strings play as smoothly and easily as do the Phosphor Bronzes and seem to add a good deal of depth to the already resonant mellowness of the Seagull.Elixer definitely still has the edge. Thanks to Bob Taylor and his crew for collaborating on something that benefits all guitar players - no matter what it says on the head stocks of our instruments."
79961,"I've been using these picks for 10+ years, they've always been great.  Between these blues and the yellow, I'm covered."
79962,Emily is getting too consumed in it all and has forgotten to live!Hate can only get you so far..just sayin'.
79963,"I am somewhat of a windshield wiper snob.  I LOVE these. I've had many other brands of a similar style that has the internal metal structure only, including OEM Nissan wipers that are similar in style.This is the only brand that has two simultaneous capabilities:1.  Doesn't skid/make noise when there isn't enough water.2.  Uniformly wipes the window and doesn't seem to get ""spots"" where it doesn't wipeI am not a Rain X user, but I do use the Rain X wiper fluid.  I find the combination of that and these blades work very well together."
79964,"this is a great product, easy to install and protects the front steal part of the winch. I would recommend this product... Michael"
79965,went in good. Truck runs smoother and quieter. Would buy again at the sale price I bought it at. Easy pour also
79966,Season 3 started with a Roar....just like a good movie....and that went on for afew episodes...till drama got in the way....crying babies and more drama that wedid'nt really need.... i dont mind knowing a bit of the crew's relationships butthis season they waste a lot of episodes on this crap. And if you are smart youcan see where this serie is going and how it possibly gonna end.So ..yep lots of great single episodes that gives Science Fiction a big boost butwe known that drama and Religion will eventually take over.So ..at this point...im only looking at the good episodes and i am fast fowardingthe social drama parts that are making me fall asleep.But by the end of this season....things once again are getting interesting...very interesting...and cant wait to watch season 4.
79967,"The birds like the feeder and the squirrels can't get to it for me to test out the ability to repel them. The hanger is on the longer side so if space is an issue you may want to look at a different type. Filling it is very easy; unhook the hanger, life the cage and fill.UPDATE: This is the only feeder out of the five I have put on the feeding station that has NEVER been overtaken by squirrels. They do cost more than some of the others but are well worth the extra cost just in seed savings alone."
79968,"I don&#8217;t spend a great deal of time outdoors. But with a pool in the backyard and warm temperatures for most of the year, mosquitoes can be a problem and bug spray is a must. And one of the brands I have used and trusted for years is Cutter.This particular brand, Cutter Backwoods Dry, is new for me but I found that it works as good or better than other insect repellants. The best quality of this bug spray, by far, is the fact that it goes on dry. There is no sticky residue and you don&#8217;t smell as bad as when you use those other sprays.  Okay, it isn&#8217;t perfectly dry, but it does dry completely in a very short time and there is a noticeable difference between this brand and others.As for its ability to repel the biting insects, Cutter Backwoods Dry works quite well. I sprayed myself, walked out into the backyard where I could visibly see the mosquitoes in the air, and I wasn&#8217;t touched by any of them. I could see them and they would get close to my skin, but wouldn&#8217;t land. It was like an invisible barrier was placed around my body. No bites, no itching, and no problems.I don&#8217;t spend as much time outside as other people I know, but I do venture into the great outdoors on occasion and I need some protection. I don&#8217;t tend to attract mosquitoes the way some people do, but they will still come after me if no one else is around and Cutter Backwoods Dry is a good product to keep the little buggers away."
79969,"I bought two microphones, a AKG D5 and SM58.  I like AKG D5 a little better than this because the vocal sounded a lot clearer and crisp on the AKG.The SM sounded muted compared to D5 without any sound modification out of box.  The output is also a little less sensitive than the D5.However I like the look of SM58 and it seems to be extremely durable."
79970,"The Weber Barbecue Mitt is very well made, like all the Weber products. I bought a pair and am very satisfied. Great price and combining to get the free Super Saver shipping is the way to go."
79971,"Ran this on my car that had 100,000 miles on the stock fuel injectors. I saw an MPG improvement of around 2 MPG after running the treatment through a few tanks of gas. The price is significantly lower than other sellers of this same stuff. Definitely happy with this purchase."
79972,"not so pleased with this, the seller is fine, no prob. there, its that this mic for my use is useless, it records tooo low, cant get enough volume from it"
79973,"Something is seriously wrong with the first half, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what it is- it's incredibly boring due to being plotless.  It's about a group of middle aged party animals that reunite for a weekend (or week) of heavy fun, drugs and drinking but... for over an hour, that's *all* they do.  This might be fun for them but certainly not for us, the viewers.  They drink and do all kinds of drugs, they roll down hills, they drive fast cars, they simply party without taking a break while reminiscing about old times and past girlfriends.However the second half... wow, now *that's* what I call an improvement!  A drastically different turn of events, in fact.  When one of the friends suddenly commits suicide due to past memories coming back to haunt him, this begins a roller coaster ride of emotions and discussions on what to do with the body, and eventually each friend is affected by becoming progressively worse mentally.  They debate whether doing the right thing and calling the cops is what they should do, or.. should they bury the body in the back yard?  After all, they're heavily under the influence of drugs (of course they don't act like they are- storyline flaw there) and a cop would be able to detect this right away.  From here, well let's just say, the emotions really take their toll on each of the friends as tensions rise and accusations fly.Of course it never really made sense how a female cop just suddenly enters the picture without reason, and even worse is the final chase scene.  Without spoiling the final segment, let's just say, why wouldn't she have a gun after it becomes perfectly clear that the suspect she's after is obviously guilty?  Another illogical moment of writing.Either way, it's unforgivable to ignore the first hour of deplorable party time that does absolutely nothing but bore me to tears.  The only time I'm impressed is when classic Sex Pistols and Funkadelic songs are playing.  REALLY good songs too, so at least the soundtrack is up to par which is more than I can say for the rest of the film.  But hey, if you're an incredibly patient person, maybe you'd be able to tolerate the first hour of nonsense just to experience the significantly better second part.  Since so much time is devoted to very little substance however, I have a hard time recommending this one."
79974,"When they killed Mitchell (Aidan Turner) I was sure he would be coming back, resurrected. Then they killed George, Russell Tovey, and Nina as well. What is WRONG with these Brits? They pull this s*** with Doctor Who every few years. Have a popular doctor or companion, who (probably) want more money, and kill them off or replace them. Like all the money has to go to the production company. No fair share to the actors. Replace them. Turner might have wanted out, but that is why you sign them to contracts, so they can't leave just because it's convenient.What is wrong with these Brits!!I thought I had 2 more seasons to watch. Bad enough they call it a series instead of a miniseries. But just acting like the actors mean nothing, is very annoying!"
79975,This filter fits perfectly and provides much needed outside air filtration. It remains to be seen how well it holds during allergy season.
79976,"I own 4 Battery Tenders, one each for my rarely driven Corvette, my wife's BMW Convertible (both driven less than 2K mi per year and stored for 4 months per year), my standby generator, and my lawn tractor.  The BMW's battery is now 8 years old, the Corvettes is 5 years old, the generators is 3 and the tractor is only a year old.  Based on the BMW, I expect to get a lot more life from the other batteries to."
79977,"Cheaper than the ""cheapies"" I could get locally.  My local Walmart doesn't carry anything smaller than 15 inch so.....  Gotta love these finds.  $7.50 a blade from Amazon.In the desert the heat / Sun kills the rubber on the blades and it almost never rains.  So I always buy the cheapest blades given that I will be replacing them sooner rather than later and they need not remove snow or ice.  They just dry rot here.  BUT, I cannot find a cheap brand smaller than 15 inches locally.  So I order here and while I am paying about $1.50 more than local cheap blades, I have no choice and I get a better brand.  Oh and I don't mess with the blade refills anymore.  It just isn't worth the hassle unless you just can't afford it."
79978,I needed an air compressor for my Polaris Rzr.  This one is compact and doesn't take up much room.  Works off a cigarrette 12v plug or alligator clips to a battery.  Works well and is a necessity if you're trail riding and get a flat.
79979,"I love Bosch wiper blades.  The installation is always quick and simple, and the quality of the blade is incredible.  These blades do a great job of wiping the windshield without leaving streaks.  They're not too noisy either.I've been using Bosch blades on my pickup truck for a couple years now.  Replacing the blades on my wife's car with Bosch blades was a no-brainer for me."
79980,"Easy to use, accurate, programmable, lights up, easy to read, decent quality.  I like it, Korg has never disappointed me."
79981,Mine was ripped this goes great with my RV fits like a glove since it adjustable it will fit about any size tire
79982,"Love to get baked and watch this show, really good way to spend 30 minutes of your day and get a lot of laughs."
79983,"I wasn't sure I would like this at the start, as it seems very slow and rather chauvenistic.  However, by the end of the first episode, I decided it was worth another viewing to see how the characters develop.  Not something I have to rush to view, but will be back."
79984,This is the only television show that pushes the envelope. Every episode we say &#34;I cannot believe they went there&#34; and there are always new twists and turns. Great new season!
79985,"I am absolutely in love/obsessed with Covert Affairs. I feel that the extremely positive reviews speak for themselves, but I too agree with the positives about this series: excellent character development, fast paced action, exciting locales, well developed, engaging and suspenseful plot line, and most of all this is all done without excessive use of language or violence. Cannot wait for more episodes October 17th!!!"
79986,"I love this show. the cast is great. piper is babelicious and a fine actress. I luv the actor who plays auggie, but my favorite actor/character is the mossad agent, eyal Levine. he was in the mummy movies. who knew? very well done show, same review for all 31/2 seasons."
79987,I have enjoyed this story so far.  Very suspenseful and it doesn't over-romanticize.  David Tennant is great in this series.
79988,"The lead character is cute.  The guest stars are great and I'd like to see that continue.The story is interesting and has a lot of potential about a startup tech company (and it's not another legal series).  Science is awesome even if it's dumbed way down.  I like the quirky characters.Please Amazon, may I have some more?"
79989,"great price, quick delivery, use several of these battery tenders on cars, trucks, motorcycles, and any battery that might tend to sit-idle for extended periods - highly recommended"
79990,Very enjoyable season premiere.  I am looking forward to watching the rest of the shows.  As soon as my daughter is asleep.......
79991,"I forced myself to sit through 5 episodes just to make sure that I wasn't mistaken in my feelings for this show.  The cinematography of the pilot was brilliant and was the main reason I gave the series more of my time than I ever should have, but even that paled quickly with the lackluster story line and turgid pace of the show.  Five episodes in and there is nothing, absolutely nothing going on, there is so little happening that it makes it hard to point to any one thing that stands out as a problem, it is just so blah that I can't see wasting anymore time on it than it took to write this.Summation, I completely understand why the show was cancelled and support that decision 100%."
79992,I certainly can not complain about this product.  It works great.  They only last about a season of camping due to the weather and sun damage.  I'll continue to buy them again.
79993,Highly recommend this to anyone great series can't wait for Season 5 to be on Prime!! Wish I would have watched the series sooner!!
79994,This is yet another post apocalyptic dystopian view of the future with an interesting twist. Now we are still on Earth but it has been terraformed to look like somewhere else and we are cohabiting with a load of aliens.The main plots lines are very conventional and depend on people doing something stupid to maintain interest (which looses my interest) however there is a background plot which holds some promise. It is fairly obvious that the way this has been scripted allows it to stop at the end of season one or continue if someone continues to fund it.Characters are conventional with the occasional alien thrown in and the odd plot twist added so you do not get too complacent. This is not a cerebral experience and can be watched without too much effort. This is just OK for Sci Fi but these days true science fiction is rare and we must take what we can get. At least it is not full of zombies and vampires which is a relief.
79995,Works great on grease and grill grime. Add water with your grill pro cleaning brush and your grill is much easier to maintain. Received  packaged in plastic bag separated from sprayer with capped bottle. I would recommend
79996,"Ringer Compost Plus is an excellent supplement to kick start a compost pile. It works with either an open pile or compost apparatus.Composting is not terribly complicated, get the right nutrients (yard waste), the right amount of water, the right temperature, the right amount of air, and the right bacteria; and that yard waste will decompose to something wonderful for your garden. The scary part with composting, if a few of those elements are off, the compost pile ends up smelling really bad. This ringer product helps get the bacteria side of the equation working right. You still have to water the pile during dry periods, aerate the pile, and add material to the top. It isn't a magic wand that takes the every other day tending out of the equation.The bacteria that decompose yard waste are already present in those leaves, grass clippings, and wood chips. It is just at a very low level. Ringer Compost Plus boosts the bacteria count quickly and gets the compost pile working much faster than if left to its own devices. In theory, applying this once should do the job, just like sourdough bread. In practice, I end up getting lazy with my compost pile and let things run crazy. Ringer's bacteria are also chosen to work at higher temperatures, meaning the compost pile will decompose quicker.Ringer's yard products are amazing. I've used their Lawn Restore fertilizer for a long time. Unlike synthetic fertilizers with really high nitrogen and phosphorus levels, this is a gentle fertilizer. I'd have to work hard to get my lawn to stripe or look uneven from this fertilizer. There is also a blend of bacteria in the fertilizer that makes my lawn a lot healthier. The product is organic, but that's not why I buy it. It just makes my lawn look great in a gentle way. Their Compost Plus hasn't changed a lot over the years either. It is the old reliable product it always was. Ringer products are not easy to find - the fertilizer is very expensive to order on line. Safer Brand is the main company. I've seen their products in Do It Better and Ace Hardware stores. I haven't seen it in the big box home repair centers.Compost Plus is a great way to get that compost pile working."
79997,Thought I'd try this but there's another brand that I prefer.  Needed to re-shift this capo a lot to get it to hold down strings evenly and not mute some.
79998,"I enjoyed the pilot. It was good, not great, but has the potential to be very good. It all comes down to character development. There were enough interesting characters here to make this a show interesting assuming that writers are talented. If Amazon decides to go forward with this series, I'll give it a try. But, I'm not convinced!"
79999,"...I am not the best splitter ever, but with this ax even i get a decent amount of wood chucked.Easy to maintain, light weight, very well balanced....all in all a good axe.As always, if you have questions please ask, I always try to answer"
80000,Have not used it yet but come this winter I am sure I will appreciate not having a dead battery.
80001,"""[REC] Genesis"" at least deserves some credit for how many types of camera perspectives it utilizes in its short 80-minute duration. It begins with a slideshow of Clara (Leticia Dolera) and Koldo's (Diego Martin) wedding; complete with star wipes and every other wipe you can think of. Then it jumps into the handheld perspective you've come to expect from this franchise. About twenty minutes later, that camera breaks and a more cinematic perspective is used throughout the rest of the film. In between that though, we see security cameras and night vision. It's actually really impressive how it all comes together.You know things are going to go downhill once the uncle shows up at the wedding talking about how a dog he thought was dead woke up and bit him, but he's okay now! The first twenty minutes may seem excruciating, but it's mostly done to witness the slow deterioration of Koldo's uncle Tio (Emilio Mencheta); his behavior becoming more and more peculiar, his eyes becoming bloodshot, and eventually throwing up blood.The horror film does get really ridiculous at times. An infection breaks out at a wedding, but why does that affect their cell phone signals? Is it because of their location? But even the landline doesn't work, so it mostly just feels like this convenient plot device thrown in to make things more messed up for the protagonists. Koldo and Clara being able to ""sense"" each other was really cheesy, as well. It's understandable to have a close bond, but their sensing abilities would have Spider-Man throwing his bag of popcorn at the screen and booing. Then there's the whole Spongejohn character, which results in the longest face palm you've ever experienced.Everything else is a lot of fun though. The make-up effects are fantastic. They seem to be the perfect blend of practical and computer generated effects. Every blood splatter, every piece of skin snapping as somebody bites it off, every decapitation, and all of the mayhem with the chainsaw. It's just glorious. The tire iron scene by the police car that goes on way too long and becomes humorous is also pretty great. The use of lighting is visually striking at times; mostly during the scene in the rain and the entire tunnel sequence. There's something about the way bright and fluorescent lighting contrasts with rain and enclosed structures that makes this infected outbreak seem that much more compelling.""[REC] Genesis"" is fairly different from the two films that come before it and introduces a batch of nothing but new characters. It may even lose fans because of the path it chooses to take. The ending is sure to be the cherry on the polarizing sundae. But if you look at the film as a love story between Clara and Koldo first and a survival horror second, then it's a bit easier to appreciate.While it is kind of silly at times and isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, ""[REC] Genesis"" is the type of bloody mess you're almost embarrassed to show other people yet still thoroughly enjoy. It almost seems tongue in cheek at times and even has shades of ""The Return of the Living Dead"" and ""Dead Alive."" This might be the minority opinion, but ""[REC] Genesis"" is short, fantastically bittersweet, and a hell of a lot of bloody fun."

80003,"It bothers me when front license plate is screwed directly to the bumper.  Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4"" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too)."
80004,"While this fuel system cleaner is pricey compared with many others, it has the highest amount of poly-ethyl-amine (PEA) and as a result it has a very bad smell. However, it is the best fuel cleaner on the market, and I use it every oil change. This is cheaper and is at least equivalent to the other popular fuel system cleaner by Amsoil. It is also about 3x stronger than regular Techron, and it's about the same price when on sale. Excellent product, 5 stars."
80005,"This review applies to ALL Miracle-Gro brand fertilizer-feeders, includingMiracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden FeederMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed Starter KitMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Feeding SystemandMiracle-Gro 100511 LiquaFeed Advance Starter KitI totally agree with ALL of you who have posted on the ""rip-off"" index of these products. My ""other half"" bought these one of each type at local home improvement warehouse on two different occasions thinking how easy it would be to use. She did not realize how EXPENSIVE it would be for the LiquaFeed Kits, it just looked EASY. Not only are the refill cartridges costly, the things LEAK, don't dispense evenly and is basically garbage! (Maybe she has learned on 2nd time around, then again ... )Miracle-Gro bulk granular water soluble fertilizers of various types are great! I have never burned any plants with them (see note below) and have healthy excellent looking flowers, plants and few veggies. But Miracle-Gro equipment is JUNK, including this item and Miracle Gro Lawn & Garden Feeder Miracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden Feeder.  They are made of BRITTLE plastic, as I stated LEAK, do not mix & dispense fertilizer well, and break easily.AVOID these products.( NOTE: I do apply in cool of morning or after sunset here in HOT central Texas, and after going around fertilizing ALL plants, come back and ""mist off"" any fertilizer that may still be too concentrated on leaves and water plants. )"
80006,Removing spark plugs from the Ford Modular V8's can be exceedingly frustrating; especially if you snap a plug in half while trying to remove it. The diameter of this tool steadies your approach down into the depths of the head and prevents you from leaning your tool sideways; thereby making in easier to remove the plug in one piece.
80007,"Our last two birdfeeders have been smaller Perky-Pet models and they've been fine. Priced at about $20, and perfectly serviceable and bird-popular even if squirrels have easily solved them.So I wanted to see how Perky-Pet's high-end ""squirrel-be-gone"" model would work. I did not pay for it, but got it free through the Amazon Vine review program.As a product it's well-made and while I think a smart squirrel will still get some food out of it, I do think this will make it difficult for them. The way the food dispenser tilts and wobbles will make it very difficult for an animal to maintain a long grip. They'll fall, and while they'll come back, they'll fall again.My other feeder, the squirrel could just hang out until I squirted him with water. This one will make them work much harder, and hopefully he gets tired of it and moves on.But is that worth $75? I just don't see how. Bird seed's not that expensive, so even if a squirrel does eat a bunch of seed, how long would it take for him to eat $50 worth of seed? However, I only deal with one smart squirrel - so if you've got several, then it's a different issue. Still, the price seems high for what is basically a fun luxury item.This is a big feeder. I have the tallest shepherd's crook, and this hangs down far enough to be difficult to see under the railings of my porch. Luckily, we can see two of the four portals even if it's a little obstructed. The point is that this is a large 3-pound feeder, and will be a big change if you're used to those smaller, cheaper versions.The size is matched with quality. This has some weight to it, and is not one of those cheap plastic models that seems to age very quickly. I think this model will have a longer useful life. I usually get rid of a feeder once a year, usually after winter, but I bet this one would last.Ultimately, while I like the product and I think it's well-made and should live up to most of its claims, the price makes it so I can't go above three stars. But - a $75 feeder that last 4-5 years is better than paying $20 for a new feeder after every winter. So IF this lasts 3-4 years I would have a different opinion.The birds use this fine - like any new feeder, took a few days, but once they got used to it they all sit there and eat all day."
80008,"""The Innkeepers"" is a thinking person's ghost story. That is what the latest effort from writer/director Ti West (""The House of the Devil"") attempts to be. He would not resort to such familiar tricks as gores and loud noises to scare his audiences. That is a good thing. Unfortunately, the premise of ""The Innkeepers,"" good as it is, ends up being poorly executed. In short, the film is atmospheric and sporadically scary, but all in all tedious.""The Innkeepers"" centers on two hotel clerks Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) working for The Yankee Pedlar Inn that will close down soon. The hotel, it is rumored, is haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a bride who died a tragic death many years ago. Claire and Luke, both enthusiastic about ghost stories and other paranormal activities, Claire and Luke, start investigating the legendary ghost, equipped with ghost hunting gear.Ti West as director employs a slow-burn approach for the first hour or so, keeping the pace deliberately slow with false alarms. That is not a bad idea. Then, while he ratchets up the tension towards the climax, he also leaves the interpretation of several key events open to our imagination. The problem is, most viewers would lose interest in what is going on before the film finally gets interesting.""The Innkeepers"" takes too much time in setting up the characters and the inn's back stories. Claire is a college drop-out who does not know what she wants to do, while Luke is a self-proclaimed paranormal investigator. Besides that, not much is revealed about them. With the arrival of former actress Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) as a guest, who gives a warning to Claire, the story finally knows where it should go.Even then, without a compelling storyline and teasing details, the film keeps us waiting for the climax that is pretty good. Until then ""The Innkeepers"" is all about suggestions and insinuations about what to come in the end, but the characters' motives remain unclear and unconvincing, and the suggested mysteries are not intriguing. Not saying everything is a time-tested technique to build interest and tension, to be sure, but taking too much time to do so (and saying too little for that matter) is a different thing."
80009,"Works great, have them put on my Smittybilt 13047B 3/4&#34; Black D-Ring."
80010,"I've had several of these from various manufacturers. I can't add a lot to the other reviews except to say that(1) they are very capable and surgically precise for pruning. They can handle quite large cross-sections as long as the material is not woody or hard. For example, they're perfect for pruning back conifers to the next junction, even 1/4 in. dia. so long as the material is ""softish"", and(2) Do not put them away in your pocket or tray or tool shelf without putting the ""sheath"" on the tip, because these are a very sharp and finely pointed weapon when locked closed. You can get a bad wound when you sit down, or crouch, or bend over if these are in a pocket unprotected.If you lose the little protective tip. use a wine bottle cork. It's greatThat said, they're probably my favorite, or one of my two, favorite pruners. Of many."
80011,"Love this series.  They are not afraid to do what needs to be done to move the story along.  It's raw, for sure, but that is part of its appeal. Great performances."
80012,Got them in 3 days and love them. So much cheaper than the stores and they are the same thing.
80013,I tried this on my Exterior Black sidings and bumpers and it doesn't last long.  But on the interior black this product works well.  It keeps my interior black and new look.  I gave this an OK product but not really impressed with it.  Let's see how long my interior look last on this Black to Black product.  But for now it's an OK product.
80014,This is a great invention.  I have five different guitar effects pedals and a loop station all attached to this.  It really saves on batteries and extension chords.  It is well worth the money.
80015,"Item is as described. You receive 3 felt picks, plus a bonus ant hill music pick. (mine was purple) Picks were defect free, but the bonus pick was noticeably dusty from the felt picks, which a clean moist cloth will easily fix. But because the picks were a bit dusty it could transfer to your instrument. None the less the picks make my uke sound louder but you may be hearing the pick a little bit. But over time this starts to disappear. The picks are pretty comfy to hold."
80016,This is season two of the most intellectual horror story on TV. A departure from season one in that now the scene is in a insane asylum run by devilish nuns. Very cool story.
80017,"This show would do very well on the ABC network- it has the same tone and themes as many shows on ABC. I did not like it very much- the characters where all somewhat forced, the story line a bit too melodramatic for me. Gael Garcia Bernal's hair is ridiculously overstyled, and his character is either complex with more to show, or a two dimensional bad guy- I suppose future episodes would help clarify which."
80018,"I have a Marantz DC garage door opener and it's is very quiet, but the noise from the garage door moving on the tracks was driving me crazy.  After WD40 and other lubricants didn't work, got the CRC White Lithium grease and applied it.  The noise was reduced to a bare minimum.  A must have if you have a garage.  I have also used this on door hinges, van sliding door, etc.  Works great!!"
80019,"Karl Urban is a good reason to watch anything, he's an incredible actor and slides right into whatever role he is portraying. In this case he is a cranky old cop and very reminisce of Harrison Ford in Blade Runner. His partner, played by Michael Ealy, is an android who is sassy and snarky and plays off well to Urban's gruff cop.The entire show is beautifully made and while it's a bit more cop drama style than I would prefer, the scenery and digital effects are gorgeous, not to mention how often you are made to think of Blade Runner. Absolutely love this show, I heard it's probably not getting renewed though so enjoy what you can of it."
80020,"Not sure if this show would work as well October - May.  However, I start thinking about football in July. The upcoming selection video my FFL does every year, running hundreds of mock drafts, the trip to LV for the actual draft and loading up my offshore account for the first weekend of NFL.The point to my rambling tangent is that this show is first and foremost about the relationship that Dani has with a football player (""T.K"" King) and a football team.  Someone once said ""life is all about timing"".What this show does well is to go behind scenes into the life of unbalanced players and their collective sense of entitlement.The show is not overly thought provoking, nor is it an adrenaline rush.  What this show is-is light hearted summer fare, which happens to be broadcast during the network ""dead zone""."
80021,"I enjoyed watching Manor House. Trying to imagine myself in the Edwardian era was very interesting to me. Every one played a great part. As the slaves were to the grand plantations in our country so were the ""service help"" to the Manors in England. The portrayal of the characters and what they went through in 3 months built up to great relationships. It was sad when it ended."
80022,"LAST NIGHT is a tightly woven tale that explores the psyches of four people in one fascinating evening. This is the initial directing outing for Iranian-American writer Massy Tadjedin ('The Jacket', 'Leo') who also created the story and the script: the film is so fine that we doubtless will be hearing more about her.Joanna Reed (Keira Knightley) is a beautiful young writer married to commercial real estate developer Michael Reed (Sam Worthington) in what appears to be a happy marriage despite the struggle between two careers. Michael takes Joanna to a company party and there she observes the soft spoken Michael paying attention to one of his co-workers, the sensuous Laura (Eva Mendes), an act that Joanna feels indicates unfaithfulness or at least suspicious behavior on Michael's part. The seed of doubt is planted, Michael is leaving for a business trip to Philadelphia the next morning with his coworkers Andy (Anson Mount) and Laura, and there is friction between Joanna and Michael that Michael's reassurance cannot overcome. The next day as Joanna sops for coffee she encounters an old flame from her time spent writing in Paris - Alex Mann (Guillaume Canet) - and they agree to meet that evening. Chemistry resurges and that evening as Alex and Joanna dine with Alex's publisher Truman (Griffin Dunne), both are questioned by Truman about their past affair, Joanna admits she is now married, and Alex is in a relationship in Paris. The couple leaves and circumstances lead them to return to Joanna's apartment where they face their feelings. At the same time as this evening is developing Michael and Laura enter a seduction dance: Michael is faithful to Joanna but the emotionally bruised Laura persists in her attempt to pull Michael into her web. The manner in which each of these temptations resolves and the aftermath is the brilliance of Massy's writing and direction: this is a story written very much form a women's vantage and that fact allows each of the characters to become very well defined and credible.The quartet of actors is well matched: Knightley continues to mature as a fine actress, Sam Worthington breaks out of his stodgy shell to allow us to see a man driven by fidelity and tempted by lust, Eva Mendes takes Laura to a higher dimension of being, and Guillaume Canet is undeniably an Alex who few women could resist: he has true star power. The method of pairing the development of the one night by flashing back and forth between the progress of the two couples in the dance of seduction vs fidelity is extremely successful. This is a thinking person's movie and an introduction of a writer/director who already has shaped the beginnings of a successful career. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, June 11"
80023,"This product from Allstar Performance is Number ALL76232 and is a Universal Two wire connector with a 12"" loop of wire so you can cut it at the proper length you need for a power feed connection or an other use with low voltage."
80024,"Very light, very handy under tight spaces and you don't have to spear this thing like bigger and heavier rakes, just reach it out and put it down, pull the claw back and towards you with a little elegance in your posture, too bad though the claw are too thin and it bounces more than I wanted from time to time. Other than that, the design of the claw really works."
80025,"We really like that this hose is so lightweight and easy to use around our large yard. It's extremely flexible and manageable, which makes me think this would be a great product especially for elderly folks who enjoy working in their yard.The valve at the nozzle has been great so far, it easily adjusts to allow little or a lot of water flow, and I find that an easy adjustment makes this hose perfect for watering delicate flowerbeds or large sections of grass or anything in between with just a little turn of the valve. This hose curls up and stores very nicely, and also has an attractive look to it.I will say this hose doesn't seem as durable as regular garden hoses (which are also heavy and cumbersome to use) and I worry that this hose won't withstand too much rough use in the yard due to it's construction as well as other reviews I've read. I would say those in need of a casual garden hose that wouldn't require much heavy duty use might really like this product, especially if you're looking for something light weight and manageable. Those in need of something really durable might want to look elsewhere.So far I've been happy with this product, but if anything changes I'll be sure to update my review accordingly."
80026,It works as described.  Hooked it to my dewalt and away she went.  Set your torque on your drill if you have it.
80027,"Roger lives an empty and unfulfilling life working for a cold corporate conglomerate, only to come home to a loveless relationship. His life is about to change when he realizes that the voice inside his head isn't his own, and he is thrust into the middle of a huge government conspiracy by a beautiful stranger that promises to help him regain control of his mind and body. METROPIA is a cutting-edge animated feature that takes place in a dreary dystopian society. Tarik Saleh uses a vapid color palette and oppressive social setting that are reminiscent of the nightmare worlds found in ERASERHEAD or Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS. The themes of brainwash, paranoia, and government control are laid out through an intelligent script, and then brought to life using ground-breaking computer animation that is unlike anything that has ever been seen before. Roger and the other character designs are frighteningly realistic, yet extremely stylized at the same time. Saleh brings together and impressive list of actors to voice his characters, including Vincent Gallo, Juliette Lewis, and Udo Kier as Ivan Bahn. METROPIA is an incredible visual experience that is finally arriving on DVD this November after winning numerous awards in the Stockholm, Venice, and Stiges Film Festivals.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
80028,"Although the Vikings vanquished their neighbors, theirs was an oral tradition and surviving records were largely written by their adversaries. In this case perhaps their early history was NOT written by the victors.Don't tune in expecting to see a meticulously accurate dramatization of peer reviewed historic records.  The History Channel's ""Vikings"" blurs geographic specificity, time lines, religion and culture. It's creatively inspired by ancient events and filmed for a contemporary 21st Century audience's sensibilities.From the opening battle scene in which the souls of fallen Vikings rise up to Valhalla, we see how belief in the power of the Viking Gods is central to the storyline. This mysticism is woven into what can at times, be a contradictory and cruel, but also earthy and gloriously heroic tale.Whatever budget the History Channel provided, production values on this show are high. The casting, costumes, scenery, ships, villages, religious centers and icons are all well interpreted, at least in an aesthetic sense.The characters are larger than life: Ragnar Lothbrok believes he is destined to make history, his brother Rollo feels it is he who should be Earl, Lagertha is wise and incredibly strong, the shaman Floki is a genius craftsman, and Althestan their Christian slave/tutor is a silent witness. Having finished watching the 1st season, I've enjoyed learning about their world and I'm still interested in, and want to know what will happen to these fascinating people."
80029,Love the SOA music. Can't get enough of it. Lover of all gene. Never knew Katy and Simm's had such beautiful voices.
80030,"They had a chance to grow, and either the older cast or writers couldn't decide on a direction. I liked the new girl and her mother. I thought that would be a good start but they did a terrible job of focusing on the new actors, and held onto what wasn't there. The actors that moved to New York were good and they could make a series of their own but the old &#34;Glee,&#34; went out on a fizzle to me."
80031,"The aerosol version just didn't cut it. The 81773 liquid formula is much better, especially with foam brushes. My intent was to use the aerosol in areas I couldn't get the brush into but it just really lacks in comparison to the liquid."
80032,"Pros:  Very sturdy, strong hitchFantastically mobile and usefulThe D-Ring is solid and the removable shackle unscrews nicelyCons:  NoneSometimes Smittybilt gets a bad rap from true, hard-core offroaders, but I must say I'm very impressed with the materials quality and the quality of the design of this Smittybilt hitch.  I wanted a removable hitch and liked the price of the Smittybilt.  In this case, I must say that I came from the price....but left impressed with the quality.  Well done Smitty!"
80033,Good price and when ordering several still comes into Australia cheaper and arrives at the front door. Typical NGK quality.
80034,"This episode offered a good plot involving a powerful political figure hampering the efforts of a homicide investigation, prompted by his own deep grief.  The investigating officers, both local and Federal had to adapt to the fact that a U.S Representative was constantly giving public news briefs that gave all potential suspects an ongoing briefing of their moves and tactics.  That plot device was well handled.  Good episode."
80035,After struggling to get old ones off these Timkin wheel bearing hubs couldn't fit any better. The ABS wires already had exact duplicates of the clips installed in the right place so they fit exactly in line to the holes for them to snap right in. After completion the wheels were so quiet as the bearing worked so smoothly. Would buy this brand again for sure.
80036,"The Rapitest, besides having a horrible product name, cannot consistently measure soil moisture.  You are better off using your finger or a dry Popsicle stick.  In addition, the optimal meter readings that they provide for various plants is way off.  I would kill my plants if I used them.It's a shame because I really wanted to like this product because it is easy to use.  However, ease of use does not matter when the product does not work at all."
80037,"I have one of these that was given to me years ago, and it is still my favorite gardening 'tool'.  The paint still looks pretty good, the hinges still work, and the cushion is still soft on my old knees.  I love that in the kneeling position, the side rails give me help in getting up.  Also, I can quickly flip it over and it's a seat for taking off my shoes or just taking a load off.  I know my green-thumb daughter will love hers."
80038,"I waited to write this as it is both difficult and unfair to review a stick in a 4&#34; pot.  This is one of two plants I ordered from 9GreenBox and both have been exceptional specimens once they got going.  You can get similar plants in a much larger size at Wal-Mart for about the same to as little as half the price of these when you include shipping, but both of the plants I purchased have grown into extremely good examples of their species, such that I would say that it is worth the few months of extra grow time if all of their plants are of this high quality.  They did also send follow-up emails asking about how satisfied I was with their products, which was nice as far as showing that they cared, but everything I've ever ordered in a 4&#34; pot has looked like a stick in a pot when it showed up here.  That is just part of the curse of mail order.  They did ship both plants with proper packing including taping paper over the top of the pots so that it would be impossible for the dirt to shift out of the container.  I could not be more pleased with this plant, or the banana I also ordered from 9greenbox."
80039,Great show. Very suspenseful and unpredictable!! Plots and subplots keeps you guessing. Only issue is that Emily's revenge demeanor is sometimes very Obvious.
80040,"I got this guitar at Guitar Center, i was scared to get this guitar from amazon because of a review saying it looked like a toy, so i wanted to see it in person, i saw it, i tested it out at guitar center and it was amazing, its better than my other les paul special ii, this guitar plays great, its set up very nicely, the pickups are very nice, the electronics work perfectly, i have no problems with it, but the guitar is very beautiful, i would highly recommend getting it, i just dont know if anyone elses will be the same, not all guitars are made the same right?"
80041,A good story line and good acting.  It's a good thing I don't have to wait for a whole week before catching the next episode.  I was working nights when this was originally on TV so never got to watch it then.  It would have been very hard to wait for a week before seeing the next episode.  This series is very addictive.
80042,"I've been detailing cars for 30 years, I tried many sealants/waxes and here to say it's the best I ever used.I applied it to a truck that I did a full correction on, it was so easy to apply but that's not what makes it the best.It's when I wiped it off which was easy, then I noticed this incredible super high gloss like no other.It truly blew me away, not only did it shine but it was so slick, as I wiped my micro towel over the paint I felt no drag, no friction and that's what you want, what will help to avoid swirls down the road, the towel just glided over the finish.From this day on its all I'll use for my paint sealant step."
80043,"Loved the first season. Was looking forward to the second season and the new wrinkles in the equation. Recognized some story and plot inconsistencies with the Green Arrow character in the DC Universe, but minor. Didn't expect Slade Wilson to be back. Totally unexpected and, I think, unnecessary. Sure, lots of things happened for 5 years in the island, but let's move on now to the present day and let the dead remain dead. Was looking more towards encounters with the League of Assassins, but I guess the script writers like nothing more than staying on in the island."
80044,"I got this movie the same day Paul Walker died.  Based on the storyline (depressing enough), I waited to watch it.  The movie is expectedly a tear jerker, but it is a pretty good movie.  Glad I bought it, but won't watch it often"
80045,"Great product!> I use this in my zero turn mower, push mower, gas weed eater and my diesel truck. I never have a problem with bad fuel or water problems.Ever winter I leave the fuel in my push mower and it always starts right up in the spring. I have used this product for many years and feel it is well worth the price, especially on Amazon."
80046,"I'm enjoying the stories and the acting is good.  It is a bit hard to understand the accent and follow what's going on at times.  But, I do look forward to watching more of this season.  It's nice to see a series that is more about solving the mystery of the case than about sex appeal.  Also nice that there is no vulgar language.  I love the main character, Vera."
80047,"good entertaining show, but nothing to blow you away.  Really good cast for a pretty good show."
80048,"I really enjoyed this film, from start to finish it consistently presented the unbiased view of everyday people, private farmers, corporate farmers, scientists that were either for or against the consumption of milk.For those reviewers stating this crappy film left them with the same questions they started out with, well then they must not have been watching the same thing! If you are capable of thinking for yourself then this film will provide you with the full list of pros and cons for the consumption of milk (both raw and pasteurized), it will give you the tools to decide for yourself whether you think it's healthy or not, and will give you various opinions from both sides of the fence. IMO this is what a successful documentary of this style should do.My two nitpicks from the film: 1)the volume jumps throughout the film so I constantly had to turn it down then turn it back up...very irritating! 2)When the film talks about the possible health risks that come with drinking milk I wish they would also openly state the possible health risks that also come along with eating vegetables or meats! No food is 100% safe, everything is covered in microbes and bacteria, of course there will be a health risk, and in fact we often come in contact with these microbes and bacteria on a daily basis. As much as this film states that there are too many political corporations scarring consumers into decisions, I would have thought they would the extra step.Bottom line, I recommend this documentary but at the end of the day (for this and many other topics), to each their own!"
80049,I enjoy these true story episodes and this one rates right there at the top for me.  If you are into this kind of thing you're going to enjoy these shows.
80050,What else is there to say. Hope it holds up to holding my winch mount. We will find out. Blah
80051,"I read the description and did not find it to my taste.  But, after watching the pilot episode, I was surprised to find myself liking it overall.  Great acting ... very believable and appealing.  I liked other &#34;Pilot Season&#34; options more, but this is still quite good."
80052,"I'm a Scott Adkins fan, so i found a lot to like about this movie. However, I have not followed the Universal Soldiers saga since the original film, so i can understand how fans of the series are disappointed in this project. Personally, i thought Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren were the worst parts of the movie, particularly the stupid speeches Dolph kept giving about being free. And what's with the silly face makeup?"
80053,Long time science fiction fan and this isa good show. Noah Wyle does a great job. Not as good as the Battle Star Galactica remake but better than most.
80054,"I'm a bit torn in my evaluation of the new thriller ""Rites of Spring."" As a low budget shocker, it leaves a lot to be desired with a clunky screenplay that raises more questions than it answers. But I also appreciated that the film attempted to meld two different film genres into one story. If not always successful, it was something that I'd never really seen before. So I'll give writer/director Padraig Reynolds points for originality. ""Rites of Spring"" is really two different films. One is a standard heist picture and one is a horror story. Neither is particularly well developed or spectacular on their own, but it's the mash-up that keeps things interesting. My head is telling me that the movie should only rate about two stars. My heart, however, is pushing me toward three stars just because the idea behind the film is rather bonkers. And I like that! I didn't love ""Rites of Spring"" and probably wouldn't view it a second time, but I enjoyed seeing the two stories collide!The first plot thread revolves around the unexplained disappearances of young women that have plagued a small community. Two girls out for a night are abducted and soon find themselves in a treacherous situation. The creepy fellow that grabbed them seems to be preparing them for a ritual sacrifice. But for what? And is there any chance of escape? The other story revolves around a gang of losers that decide to kidnap a wealthy man's daughter to extract a fortune in ransom. Of course, not all goes as planned. There are some major trust issues and personal agendas within the group. Before the evening is through, they'll have to determine just who is playing whom. But wouldn't you know it? The abducted girls are on a property adjacent to the where the kidnappers are holed up. So a night of crime will soon collide with a night of horror. As the body count escalates, it becomes a battle for survival. Will anyone endure until dawn?My biggest complaint about ""Rites of Spring"" has to do with a lack of genuine plot development. Nothing really makes much sense in the telling. Neither story, as written and presented, would be satisfying on its own and that's a near fatal misstep. The kidnapping scheme is rather ridiculous and we never know how these guys got together to do something so extreme. Meanwhile, the horror story gets the vaguest (and most over-used) of explanations. Reynolds sets up these two separate scenarios, but each one feels a bit lazy (especially if taken alone). Trust me, aside from the mash-up angle, you've seen it all before and you've seen it better. At a brief 81 minutes, however, it is just nutty enough to hold your attention. About 2 1/2 stars. As I said, I'd have been happy enough watching this for free, but it's not something that I'd recommend as a blind purchase. KGHarris, 11/12."
80055,"We like these shows set in England in the 1800s and thereabouts. This one had a happy ending, which I like, but plenty of challenges to overcome along the way! The acting was good, I thought, unlike some of the period films and television shows. Sets and filming locations lent to the authenticity, as well."
80056,"I have to admit: my expectations were fairly lofty for Bad Milo. Marino is a man-god and the brilliant Gillian Jacobs (Community) is in this too. It's also about a demon that climbs out of a dude's rectum to commit bloody murder. Those are some powerful ingredients.But would could have been a tasty souffl&eacute; of delight and coolness ends up merely as a serviceable B-movie. It's unique, for sure, and Marino carries himself with the expected verve, but in the end Bad Milo just missed cult immortality.Why? It's difficult to pinpoint. There aren't any screaming deficiencies. The story moves along swimmingly and the acting is solid&#8212;there just isn't that magic, that unquantifiable energy that these types of drive-in flicks require for greatness. In fact, as I sit here typing up this review having viewed the movie a scant few days ago, it's difficult to summon anything that stands out (aside from a particularly egregious murder/castration perpetrated by Milo).Granted, this sound negative; really, this is a fun little flick. But hopes are hopes and I was angling for some truly inspired lunacy. Bad Milo comes close, but falls short. However: I would be remiss to punch out of this review without some positivity. At least these guys tried and, in fact, succeeded in turning out something new and original and crazy, so let's honor them for what they did and not what they didn't do. Here then is my itemized list of Bad Milo Good Stuff.MiloPoints awarded&#8212;forever&#8212;when monster movies opt for practical execution of their beasties. So it is with Bad Milo and the nasty little construction that lends its name to the title. The puppeteers do a great job with the expressions and performance nuances and the creature design is imaginative. End result? A nifty entry into the low-buster monster paddock.MarinoI've suitably gushed about him enough, but Ken Marino deserves as much cred as I can cough up. For the man who introduced &#34;I want to dip my balls in it&#34; into the pop culture lexicon he's been long under-represented in the leading man business. But let's get to it: any man who willing assumes the position to let a gremlin crawl out of his bumhole deserves a nod.JacobsGillian Jacobs should be given much more work in prominent roles. That is all.The payoffThere's some obtuse metaphor work going on here (inner demons manifesting), but the draw is the monster running wild and the denouement features all manner of mayhem and a surprisingly sentimental finale. A fine capper to a fine little movie. Sadly, those are the highest levels it reaches.Bad Milo (Blu-ray) is a sleek 1.85:1/1080p (MPEG-4 AVC-encoded) transfer, joined by a DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio mix serving up an all-around solid technical presentation. Extras: director and cast commentary, outtakes, the extended dinner scene (which is very funny), a deleted scene, an interview with Ken Marino, a featurette on the puppetry, a behind-the-scenes look at the editing, an AXS TV promo, and the theatrical trailer.David Johnson, DVD VERDICTRad the full review at dvdverdict.com"
80057,"Ordered one of these Gig Bags for a new Les Paul - the hard shell cases are back-ordered, and I didn't want the guitar just sitting attracting dings and dust.Fits a LP Studio perfectly, has room for small items in an outer zippered pocket. Does the Job !"
80058,"Dad, daughter and son all love this. I like the episodes without a villain best. I think nature is enough, but i do appreciate the undertone of conservation.most of all i like the shorts at the end. so jammed packed with knowlege!"
80059,a little costly for cracked corn but the ducks and geese love it!!
80060,"For what it's worth, Jessika Lang is really, really good in this.  She pulls off the Boston accent much better than the syrupy VA accent she tried to pull off in the first season (God, I hope she's not from VA, I'll feel like an idiot).  This show, as many have described, is really pretty silly.  Throw aliens, gamma rays, Nazi's, Catholic run sanitorium, mass and serial murder and gore into one show and BAM!!!Fun, but get ready for some real goof ball soap opera horror...minus the horror."
80061,Complicated characters. Weird criminals. Nicely written. I always look forward to it. I also like the way the show deals with addictions.
80062,"I found this a bit slower than BBC's new show &#34;Sherlock&#34;. Arthur Conan Doyle would probably be pleased that his characters are alive and given a modern twist.  When I heard that Watson was a girl in this series I wasn't sure I would enjoy this show. (Not true to the books) And Sherlock as a recovering drug addict, while true to the story, came off a bit tame.  But after watching the first two shows I was hooked. Elementary is somewhat less about Sherlock being a know-it-all than the other Sherlock Holmes shows/movies, and more about character development.  Something of a shock was the reveal of Moriarty's true character (which I won't spoil here even with hints).  I look forward to Season 2."
80063,"Very engaging.  Some great characters, including the young lead and of course the Maestro.But the drinking game surrounding playing instruments was a bit over the top."
80064,"It was very interesting to watch their many struggles and some small successes that bring them joy and encouragement.  Amazing how much work and financial risk is involved in gold mining for often so little profit, if any.  Of course, if they hit it big, as these miners believe they will then, I guess, it is all worthwhile.  Not something that I would personally want to participate in doing but it is enjoyable to watching others make the effort."
80065,"The first series was very enjoyable and strikingly different from most other series on TV.  The characters were introduced and fleshed out in interesting ways, but by series 3 and certainly after that the episodes seem fake and feel almost scripted as if the family is presented with a scenario that they will then improvise.  Whereas the first series felt like a genuine insight into the family life of these self-avowed rednecks, the later series start to feel more like an advertising and merchandising exercise designed to play on the caricatured personalities that each of the players has become.  The gold vein is running out."
80066,"Although not as deep as the original , it is still very entertaining. The original had more growth to the character development as Aang had to learn the other elements, this one skipped that process. More action oriented, due to the shorter season."
80067,this is really nice. its stainless steel so it wont rust an the bumper stops the bang and noise. plus it keeps the door open.
80068,Both the film and the subject. I've never seen a group of more dysfunctional and dangerous people ever. Not worth the time. Who wants to know about people of this ilk anyway. Yuk.
80069,"I have heard from a lot of people about this show, so I was curious to see a few episodes for myself.  It lives up to the descriptions of my friend, but I was disturbed by how the therapists treated - or rather failed to treat - the underly issues of the &#34;hoarders.&#34;  The show is seriously over dramatized, which isn't unexpected for a reality TV show, but I would expect more from the therapists, who I would assume have a professional duty to treat their patients rather than to just antagonize for the cameras."
80070,"Elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar. D'Addario has finally made a string that is comparable to and maybe a little tiny bit better than the Elixir's.These are very nice bright strings. The coating is incredibly subtle, almost impossible to feel on the strings. I like that. Compared to Elixir's these are a bit brighter, with good feel.Call me old school, I hate the packaging. These strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag. Ah, you know I'm just so used to strings that are individually looped. Two strings looped together makes a mess while I'm restringing a guitar - when I unwrap that pair, I've got a string that has to sit out unwrapped on the bench. The neat freak in me hates that. I also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag. Yeah I get it; they are trying to be more environmentally responsible. But darn it, 6 paper envelopes? It feels to me like they are just trying to cheapen up the packaging materials, not some environmental cause. 100% post-consumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load.I know D'Addario loves the color coded ends. On my acoustic guitar that's irrelevant, the ends are hidden inside the guitar behind the pegs. On my electric guitars, I don't like the look at all. I prefer gold or silver rings at the end. If the strings are in individual labeled packages, there's no need for the colors.D'Addario loves the color coded end rings so much, they do a horrible job color coding and simplifying their packaging. I have yet to decode their colors or naming system.I normally use 10 gauge strings in my acoustic guitar. I tested these at 12 gauge and am surprised how much I like them. The slightly thicker string is not bad.Oddly these strings are priced almost the same as Elixir's. My reason for using the original D'Addario strings is low price - if somebody is doing gigs nightly, those uncoated strings are the only way to go. Strings end up being changed long before corrosion becomes an issue for the gigging musician. For the home enthusiast, coated strings make a ton of sense, they do last longer. I think they are worth the premium price. Now there are two choices for excellent coated strings.In the end, the packaging, the color coded end rings, the crazy package coding, and the double looped strings all mean nothing once the strings are on the guitar. What they sound like and play like is the most important thing. And in that regard these are excellent strings."
80071,I have this tender hooked up to four Harleys.  I can easily glance at the tender box to check each battery's status.  I bought four extension cables to ensure I can hook up bikes at a distance.  I highly recommend this product.  I had a single battery tender which lasted me seven years.  I hope this one lasts just as long.
80072,"This trap can actually catch mice, but if they aren't small, will only injure them.  It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat, who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as ""starting fluid"" in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care."
80073,"A key thing to realize with this trap's bait is that it killed the mice when there was no other food to be had. That suggests that, out in the real world, a mouse would rather wander off and eat something else rather than take a big blue bite of the brick inside this bait station. I can say, with certainty, that the mice snacking on my garden have zero interest in this product."
80074,"I'm a woman, a mom, and the one who owns all the tools in our family... power or otherwise. My husband doesn't have a DIY bone in his body, and I'm too thrifty (ok cheap) to pay someone to do something I can do myself... even if it's something I pretty much hate. Yes, I admit it... I hate painting. However I also like freshly painted walls and change my decorating tastes frequently, so I've painted every room in each of our last 3 houses at least once, usually a couple times each. I've spilled a full gallon of paint on the carpet (thank goodness for owning carpet cleaners), I've ruined paint brushes by not washing them well enough, wasted lots of money on rollers because the thought of even trying to wash them was too daunting after being exhausted from painting rooms, I've cursed and complained and yet still continued to paint those walls.After trying this sprayer once all I thought to myself is "" YOU IDIOT!!!! WHY DIDN'T YOU GET ONE OF THESE YEARS AGO??? "", I did try another sprayer once... I believe it was a B&D; that was passed on to me from my stepdad... it was horrible, you had to thin out your paint, it clogged every 5 seconds, it was worse to wash out that 100 thick napped roller covers, I think I threw it away.... well if you've had an experience like that in the past don't let it cloud your sunny future with this sprayer. It's nothing like that.The directions are detailed and clear, parts are easy to figure out and put together. The longest part of the painting process is your prep, do a really good job with this since it's easier to keep paint off something than it is to remove it from something. I do recommend doing some tests before starting on your actual project so you get a feel for how the sprayer works, the different ways you can spray, etc.It's winter here now so I'm only able to use this indoors but for once I can't wait for the warmer weather so we can refinish our deck (a task I had been dreading when It hought I'd have to do each spindle by hand), I expect it to go so much faster and easier now... and I have some furniture I was thinking I'd have to use cans of spray paint to refinish that I now play to use this sprayer for instead!Buy one, you won't regret it!"
80075,i bought this to change the tire on my 05 cbr motor cycle cause a shop i went to wanted 100 dollars for the front and back tires to mount and balance them so i bought these and they do a good job of saving the rim while your removing and installing the tire
80076,"It's a Fram - a name I've learned to trust over the years. My only gripe is that none of my cap filters fit on the end, even the small ones."
80077,"In the year 2014 the most reliable way to kill rats is still the old-fashioned trap with food (peanut butter works really well).This trap is supposed to snap the rat and thus kill it. This is a theoretical situation. I would caution you to watch your fingers and set it very carefully. also, sometimes, rats do not die in the trap, and are pinned against in it instead. Be very careful when handling the trap with the rat in it. Traps in general are hit or miss and this one is no exception.Also, beware that using peanut butter or cheese will attract pets. Place the trap in a place where the pet can't get to it.Warn children not to go anywhere near it as well -- you don't want the child getting his or her fingers snapped off or handling a dead rat, or worse, getting bitten by a trapped rat."
80078,"The active ingredient Deltamethrin works well on odorous ants here in New Mexico. We use it outdoors near doors, patios, and on any visible ant mounds. Once this product has been applied the ants disappear. While it may be water-proof, NM rains wash it away and it must be reapplied."
80079,"Working Great. Wouldn't have minded handles, but it does look better then the one with handles."
80080,"The capo is pretty good. I like the ability to customize tension. However, it is unclear which way the capo should be put on - with the &#34;pincer&#34; side facing the floor, or facing the ceiling? In either direction, it's a bit awkward to put on/take off, as the angle of the pincer is difficult to get right quickly. The Kaiser is still the best, IMO, but you can't adjust the tension on those. Overall, this is good but not great."
80081,My son uses this winder and cutter frequently to change his strings on his acoustic and electric guitar. It hasn't failed him yet. It's easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly. He says it's a must have if you maintain and change your own guitar strings. Highly recommend.
80082,"I had my doubts about this show; however Matthew Perry is good, so I gave it a watch one night. Sometimes silly. Sometimes serious. Always funny!"
80083,"After purchase of the first one immediately ordered a second.  Well-made, attractive, and works like a champ. A little more expensive than some, but worth it."
80084,"Update - July 4th, 2014.After using it for about the twentieth time over the course of LESS than a year, the internal rubber hose portion ripped in two and water went everywhere. My three star rating is now a two star rating. Reason being, for the short period of time it was used it was nice not having to drag a larger and heavy hose around. Durability is definitely an issue and I would not recommend this.I think we've all seen commercials for similar versions of this expanding hose and thought  ""what a neat idea..."". And if you're like me, you're extremely skeptical about the functionality of it. Well I'm surprised to report that this expanding hose is awesome... SO FAR.As it sits it takes up a little less than one cubic foot of space, way less than any regular 75' hose.The hose comes with a ball shutoff valve so that you can close the valve to build up pressure in the hose to make it fully expand. Now here is the issues I have with it. When you open the valve to use the hose, the water pressure decreases enough that the hose starts to contract and get shorter and shorter the longer I used it. And it's not a lack of head pressure at the spigot (we have 40+PSI from our well).Durability... that's still up in the air. This definitely is not a everyday use hose as I can already tell with minimal usage that it's not going to last. This is use only a few times a week hose to water some patio plants sort of hose.For me, I've been using it as a garage hose to wash the cars with since it stores in such a small space and I only have to/get to use it a few times a month.So at the end of the day this is NOT a replacement hose for gardening, lawn, or any other daily use hose."
80085,"Okay - so you need simple running lights but don't want to splice, cut or solder your existing wiring and just want a simple solution.Well here it is. Each of the two lights are sleek and solidly made and have molex connectors on each one. If you can change a car battery and access your existing front light connections then you can install this kit. Each LED is rated at 5200K - a cool white which is bright and contains SMD type LEDs that last almost a lifetime.Once installed (which obviously will vary in difficulty depending on your vehicle) the lighting is automatic; no extra switches or on/off issues. It all adjusts accordingly based on your car's current status - on/off/high/low etc.Based on the manufacturer's disclaimer these lights are legal for both day and night use - and as pure white there's no reason why they wouldn't be, and they are designed to withstand the worst of the weather and power washing.If your car has spare vents, or an area at the front for forward accent lights then this is the turnkey kit to buy."
80086,"My husband and I love this series. We started it on Netflix during the Olympics and finished it on amazon prime in about a week. We are ready for new episode tonight on the cw. The series kinda reminds you of batman, but it's still very good!"
80087,"I own a 2002 Nissan Frontier and the OEM headlight bulbs were the regular Sylvania 9007 halogens. These OEM's have tremendous life but I noticed that they are starting to fade out, their brightness are decreasing significantly. Time to change and I opted for the Silverstar Ultra after seeing it in a TV commercial and based on my experience with the OEM's. After installing it, I noticed that they were only marginally whiter and brighter than the OEM's. The huge difference was in the angle where the beam of the light is being projected--it is much more wider than the OEM's. I work night shifts and there is a significant stretch in my drive where the roads are really, really dark. With the Silverstar Ultra's, its like your fog lamps are turned on too because of the wider angle of light projection. Overall satisfied with these bulbs but again, the brightness and whiteness are only marginal. Nevertheless, its a worthwhile purchase."
80088,"A bit derivative. A good cast. Throw in a cop a convict (innocent?) a whore and a gay clown, what's not to like. I'd definitely like to see what happens next."
80089,"My wife and I have enjoyed this series. It is a well thought out, London based, murder mystery series that featured strong acting, character development, and pacing."
80090,I love this nozzle. it is great! there are multiple functions it can be used. Very handy to use when it comes to cleaning a car or spray water to ur garden!
80091,"Good product holds down my outdoor patio rug.  Be sure to have something on hand to pull them back up as they lay very flat and the disks are recessed to prevent the nail heads from being trip hazards. Through trail and error I've found it best to not drive the nails tightly flat against the disks, leaving just a small gap that allows me to grip the heads with pliers when I'm ready to pull them back out. I'm very happy with this product."
80092,"If you haven't seen this show, see it.  If you like vegan, metrosexual life type shows, go watch ""Friends"" and eat a tofu burger.  If you are a man or woman who likes drama and entertainment without the neurotic crap, this is a show."
80093,Haven't had a chance to use this grease gun but It looks to be perfect for the application I need it for.  It looks like it will be able to shoot lube up in some real tight places.  I am really excited to use this but I think I will stop before i get too graphic.  I am batman
80094,"We only moved into the area about two years ago and friends and neighbors have been very generous in sharing their plants. However, when a plant has been dug up, often the tiny rootlets are disturbed and many of my transplants didn't make it.As a result, I have started using a tiny bit of this on the rooting area of the plant to encourage new growth, and I have been pleased with the success."
80095,"some of his humor it too brutal- ie harsh videos that are of the JACKASS variety, His personal deliver is smooth and funny."
80096,"The only thing that kept me from making this a one star was the fact that two of the actresses were well played and well cast.  That being Constance Wu and Bebe Neuwirth.  Other than those two, the cast was simply stupid.  Most of the songs were ridiculousness and the direction of the show was like a wet washcloth.If you don't like stupid comedy skip this one, or rather watch it and rate it so junk like this doesn't get made."
80097,"Im a beginner. Good harps. Good solid sound.I cant bend at all so no idea if its just me.Youtube these, there's loads of videos."
80098,"This is one of those British series with a good story line and excellent actors. There is little bit of everything in the storyline. The time frame is after WWI and all the feelings and aftermath of people's life. Those of us that have been following Dolton Abbey need another DA like &#34;fix&#34;, and this works nicely."
80099,"While boondocking,I  use this inverter inside my RV to connect my ROKU box to a 12 volt receptacle. It works just fine and doesn't use up a lot of power like it would if I used a full-size inverter like a 300-400 watt inverter.  I love this little inverter, and I also use it to plug in USB powered devices to charge also.  If you need a little inverter to power a cellphone, netbook or some other small powered electronic devices then this is the one to get.UPDATE:  When I first wrote this review I wrote it in regards to the previous model (75watt charger with a SINGLE USB port), and since then they now make one with two USB ports.  I've since purchased 2 more of these units.  My update is that the one with the single USB port allows you to hook up a triple gang outlet extension to this device and still use the one and only single USB port, and if you use the extension on the new dual USB model you can't access any of the ports if hook up an extension.  But, if you have no intentions on hooking up an outlet adapter to this unit, then the dual ports work wonders and either way you go these bestek inverter chargers are AWESOME.  I even own the 150 watt one.  By the way, I use these daily, actually all day long, and they stand up very well. I'm VERY satisfied!  Highly recommend!"
80100,Little ones love anything to do with the Bubble Guppies. She knows all their names and Bubble Puppy too.  Hope there are more soon.
80101,"A nice, more quiet cartoon but still captures kids attention!  It encourages problem solving and also shows real child segments at the end of each episode (2 mini episodes per show).  The kids love it because it has many animals and funny moments...when George gets things mixed up or is too curious!  I prefer shows like this that are fun, educational and not annoyingly crazy or loud."
80102,"Entertaining, instructive, and well done. Outstanding without commercials and even though slightly dated, very much worth the time to learn about items like &#34;sharp blades&#34;. My hope is that if Amazon revises what Prime costs and offers more programs like this as a result, the entire series will be available to members."
80103,I honestly can't describe this and give it justice. It is a great mix of raunchy and nerd humor... a must watch and I NEED this to be a series.
80104,"I purchased this to add the antifreeze to my camper. I found it easier to remove the fill tube nozzle under the cabinet and dump right into the tank. I bought this because I thought I needed it to flush my new camper. I didn't use it at all, because the way the pump lines were hooked up. It wouldn't have worked anyways. Might be ok for older campers, just not new ones."
80105,"We get these teeny, tiny, TEENY little ants around this time of year.  I've used the liquid ant bait traps with limited success in years gone by.  I thought I'd try this DE this year and see how it works.  As soon as the ants appeared (and they like to crawl up the side of the house and into the bathroom) I went out and foofed some of this all along the space where I saw them coming up from the ground, then gently swept it into every crack and crevice I could find.  HEY!  They're GONE!  Let's hope they STAY gone.It's a very lightweight container for its size, and has a fairly good nozzle on it.  The best way to get the very fine powder out is to aim that nozzle where you want it and then gently squeeze the bottle, dispensing some of the powder.  Too heavy a squeeze and you get a BIG poof of it though.  I do recommend using some safety glasses and a face mask when you use it - not good to inhale this stuff, even though it's not a chemical compound.  Reapply if it rains or gets wet otherwise, to keep the effectiveness going.I'm also going to put some around my lettuce beds and see if I can keep the earwigs and sowbugs at bay this year."
80106,"Just Like Ctenosaura said we as Tron fans need to show Disney how much we want this show back and alas Americans vote with their dollars so buy the season, write a review, U will not be disappointed."
80107,Tuner works great. Both by vibration and mic.Only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak. Mine broke off... not even a year old.
80108,My truck was in need of a new fuel filter and all the parts stores around wanted nearly 3 times the price of what Amazon wanted.
80109,"This season is not as good as other seasons, but it's still alright. One of my favorite episodes is when it's HALLOWEEN and Satan is throwing a big Sweet Sixteen party and acts like a spoiled rich teenager. Also Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny deal with the death of their friend Chef, stop Manbearpig, try to get a Family Guy episode pulled, defeat a nerdy gamer on World of Warcraft, and stop Ike from having sexual relations with his smokin' hot teacher. (Nice!) All this and more happen in SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE 10TH SEASON!!!"
80110,"my daughter got this show without asking..i dont even care to see it..It looks like hype to me. I didnt see any  bevies of smokin hotties (like on the cover) at the Navy Exchange, but rather what they refer to as small herds of dependapotamus's roaming the aisles blocking traffic with their extremely wide pondunkadunks...just sayin... ;-)"
80111,I really enjoy smart television and this show is smart.  It's well written and the characters are lovable.  I would definitely recommend!
80112,This music package by Led Zepplin is historical and put together well. Great for any Zep fan. Great audio and video. I especially liked the unreleased version of For Your Life!
80113,"I failed when purchasing this tool.  I was trying to substitute for the real full size kit to do some of my jobs.I stongly suggest that you don't follow in my foot steps.I couldn't even use it once.  Myabe it could have been that it didn't offer the right size or configuration for the car i was working on that day.  But there is something else that is wrong with going with a tool like this.  Even if it had the right size or configuration, If the caliper piston has come out too far for this tool to fit in between the caliper and the piston then it would render it useless.I would recommend Astro Pneumatic 78618 Brake Caliper Wind Back Tool Set - 18 Piece.  Whether it's for professional use or personal, I strongly suggest a tool like this one.  It's going to be worth the investment, trust me.  As of this review time it's currently $36.92 from Amazon.Good luck"
80114,"I love this show, it is fun and different and not your usual predictable TV fare. I liked the last episode that left you hanging with Emma and Henry not remember anything about Storybrooke or the people... It should be fun seeing them remembering again, looking forward to March when Once resumes."
80115,The Planet Waves instrument cables have a nice heft to them and click firmly into the amp/instrument.I have had no problems with them at all.The attached elastic tie down that comes with these custom cables makes it easy to coil the cables for storage.5 stars.
80116,"My front lawn is separated into two sections by a sidewalk, and it hasn't been fertilized in many years. I decided to apply this lawn food to one side of the lawn to see if it made a difference. I installed the batteries in the spreader and applied it as directed. It was easy to use, much easier than the old hand held spreader I used a long time ago. I took my time, gently swinging the spreader around me, and the food appeared to go on evenly. I watered my lawn and let it go.  It's been almost a full month since I applied the food, and I can definitely see a difference between the two sides of my lawn. It's not a huge difference, but it is greener and looks healthier. My neighbors also noticed the difference. I feel confident that if I continue using this food, it will continue to look better. I'll mark my calendar and update my review accordingly this fall."
80117,"I was at about 3-1/2 stars on this one.  It was a cool movie.  Kinda reminds me of going home, and seeing people you haven't seen in years."
80118,"This doesn't come in it's own box and it wasn't packed well.  The clear guard was split in half and the perch base mangled.  The base is very thin metal, so I wasn't surprised, luckily I was able to bend it back into shape with my hands.  The means of squirrel deterrence is the base being spring-loaded so the weight of the squirrel pulls the neck over the feeding holes.  This is hindered by the thin base getting bent out of shape and by smarter squirrels simply holding on to the midsection and feeding upside-down (they could reach around the clear guard after I glued it back together).For this method of squirrel proofing, I prefer the feeders that have the entire exterior spring-loaded, so that no matter where the squirrel grabs on, the hatches close.  The same company even makes that style and sells it for cheaper."
80119,I really like using this pick with my acoustic nylon string guitar.  The rubber makes it easy to hold onto and I feel it obtains good sound on the guitar as well.
80120,"I wanted to try this as a neighbor is always shooting the squirrels ,rabbits and really does not care  that his BB gun is not very effective at killing them so they suffer.The  havahart Trap works great. Easy to set up and easy to realease the critters you catch.I thought I would try trapping them and relocating them.  I have not caught any skunks but then we have never had any around here. You can easly disguise it by covering with pine needles, branches etc. The cage also protects whatever you catch from being injured until you can release it.It is one thing if another animal catches them as a food source, but to kill them because they do the things squirrles, rabbits, etc do is senseless.I have also used it to transport small  injured animals  to the rehabiltation center. It keeps the animal secure,you can still get a syringe through the openings ( for anesthesia)so no one gets hurt when removing  the animal from the cage.The price is reasonable. It is well made. Other Havahear traps I have seen last forever!"
80121,"Good quality bag for my Epi LP. Fit like a glove, in fact I wish they were a little larger to hold some accessories."
80122,"I got completely hooked on this series.  Looking forward t season 5.  The real story isn't about the zombies, but about survival."
80123,"I got these just to see if they are worth the money and I will say that while you can get foam/sponges all over the place now, this is one of those products that you buy in association with other products. I would probably not make a special purchase just for these, but they're good accessories. The foam does appear to be a better quality that what you get at the local parts houses. They take a beating and if used right will do wonders for keeping you clean while you apply tire dressing or even do a spray cleaning of your interior. Good stuff and bigger than I thought they'd be."
80124,"Season 4 was a washout. The only good thing was the set designers did actually manage to make it look a bit like Ireland which was impressive. Season 5 is back on track kind of but does pan out a little pat. It is very hard for them to keep this pace up for this long though, so well done to Sutter and his team.I predict Season Six will be the end and will conclude exactly like the Shield did.As an aside, The Shield is a better piece of work but then it's pretty hard to beat Walt Goggins when he's dialled in that much."
80125,"My lawn is in pretty good shape but there are some areas under trees where the lawn suffers a bit.  I usually have my lawn aerated because of the size of the lawn for $30.  But I like this tool for breaking up the ground in spots where I need to plant new seed in bare spots.  I also like it for use in garden areas and other places where the large aeration machine can't reach.  I definitely cannot recommend this product for use on a regular size yard, even if you want the workout.  It clogs a little too often."
80126,"I am really enjoying the strange and quirky characters of &#34;Fargo&#34; the television series, and can't wait to find out how the season will end.  As a HUGE fan of the Coen brothers' film &#34;Fargo&#34;, I was skeptical about the series based on one of my favorite movies.  How could the series possibly live up to the movie it was based on?  How could they find a cast that is comparable to Frances McDormand, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi?  Are the writers up to the task, and will the story be as darkly hilarious as the original?Well....I am surprisingly very pleased with both the writing and the cast of the TV series, and they continue to impress and shock me, week after week.  Billy Bob Thornton is Emmy-worthy in his portrayal of the mysterious Lorne Malvo, and the writers deliver enough humor to mostly offset the darkness, which is not an easy task.I don't want to give anything away here, but if you are a fan of the film, you owe it to yourself to give this show a chance.  I was &#34;meh&#34; after episode one and totally on board after watching episodes 2 and 3."
80127,"I only use Dunlops. For a number of reasons. First, the texture of the plastic gives a good sound, and easier to hold on to. Second, the ""grippy"" texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to. Thirdly, they make many sizes, for all the right occasions. Two thumbs up! Use these for general acoustic guitar strumming, they are not too thin and not too thick. I use the .60mm, .48mm, and .38mm. sizes."
80128,"Some movies are so perfectly suited for the MST3K treatment, that it's as though god created them specifically for that purpose. HOBGOBLINS, EEEGAH!, POD PEOPLE. These are some of the wondrous gems of yore. Well, add WEREWOLF to this hyper-schlock short-list! The plot: A lycanthrope skeleton is excavated in Flagstaff, Arizona. Hair sprouts. Mayhem commences. All the qualifications are there- petrified characters, driftwood-quality ""acting"", ding-a-ling dialogue, and virtually no storyline! Mike and the bots play this ""film"" like a finely-tuned instrument made of pure Cheddar! Yep, this is another unwatchable mess, saved by the team. Behold! The brilliance of ten trillion suns! Amen..."
80129,I bought this stuff and it didn't clean anything off my chrome rims.  Worthless crap.  wouldn't mind getting my money back for this red bottle of goop.
80130,"Funny, quirky and extremely entertaining for all ages - I hope there is another season in the works .... enjoyed every episode"
80131,"This gel mouse attractant really attracts mice! No doubt about that. And it doesn't contain poison, so I don't have to worry if any of my other animals inadvertently get into it. A small amount the size of an eraser on the tip of a pencil is enough to bring them to the trap. The rest, of course, is the difficult part. Getting rid of the little critters from a live catch trap or disposing of the little dead bodies from a kill-type trap. Not fun no matter how you look at it, but unfortunately necessary. My only complaint is that the gel seems to be drying in the bottle and is increasingly hard to dispense each time I use it even though I keep it tightly closed between uses. So, 4 stars. I have learned a lot about directing mice to the trap, like covering the metal bottom and sides as much as possible, putting up barriers that funnel the mouse toward the entry to the trap. So my mouse-trapping skills have improved and along with Motomco's attractant I hope to be able to get the little critters out of my storage shed and chicken coop. Wish me luck!"
80132,"This movie was okay, but the subject matter was just like numerous past science fiction films.  All in all, it was an enjoyable movies for a night at home."
80133,"Alien creatures attacking people is standard fare for movie-makers in Hollywood.  As computing power becomes cheaper, we see more movies of this genre being made outside the US.  Examples include District 9, The Darkest Hour, and this film based in London, Storage 24.  Released to minimal fanfare, this film is based is part action, part suspense, and part horror.  The story is simple enough; a cargo craft crashes in downtown London, releasing an alien creature which gets into a rental storage facility.  Inside the facility are a group of individuals, some friends, some workers, who are trapped.  One by one the alien kills them until the people finally band together and fight back.  After this, the people manage to escape facility, only to discover that all of London is under invasion by more of these aliens.The plot bears similarities to other recent alien invasion films, such as Super 8 for example.  The cast is composed of unknowns, but they do a good job in this movie.  The special effects are decent, though not exceptional.  Overall, a good, but not great film."
80134,Well made just like all the other greenworks tools I own. You can't go wrong with this brand. Their 10 inch electric chainsaw is a beast. This thing is very well made. Looks like it'll easily last the next 20 years.
80135,"I've been wanting a grill wok or similar product for a while now, and this one is a beaut. It is larger than I anticipated, and yet it is well balanced and easy to handle. I especially appreciate the second-handed assist handle because, when the wok is loaded down with food, it could be heavy.While the lid itself does detach from the bottom of the skillet, it won't come off unless you deliberately open it all the way up to remove it. This is a good thing! Finally, the hanging loop is wonderful. The mesh holes MAY be small enough to pop popcorn, too, but I haven't tried that yet.This is going to sound crazy, I know, but I'll also use this to sift compost. (I don't buy or keep anything I can't use for at least several purposes!) Held hanging down at my side and clipped shut, the width is perfect to shake along a row to side-dress growing plants. This wok is made of durable, high-quality stainless steel, so I'm sure it'll hold up to this purpose. And if it doesn't, well, it'll be another versatile gardening tool. I could use it to shake dirt off mushrooms I harvest or to thresh dried beans."
80136,I have watched Grey's Anatomy since it began and I love it. It is the one and only series I have followed. I am attached to the characters outcome and that is due to the fine writing in the show. Yes I know it is a soap opera and it is my &#34;guilty pleasure&#34; but it entertainment and I love it!
80137,"THE FUTURE AND IT's mixed human kinds is not new, but the characterization is interesting and the INTRIGUING play between generations and their opposing &#34;racial&#34;  prejudices make the interplay contemporary and thought provoking."
80138,The Taylor strap is very nice and works like a strap should. You will notice that it does not slip around once over the shoulder like the nylon cheap straps do.
80139,"It has been a while since I put new strings on my acoustic guitar. These went on with no problems. They have a brassy sound to them. Since purchasing them, they still ring nicely."
80140,"We love watching the group & all their dances, whether they are group dances or solos.  They are all quite taleneted.  But hearing the mom's rag all the time & fight, gets annoying...."
80141,"I bought this guitar in 2005.  It sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way.  I think this is a good guitar and when you think that something that might sound better would cost three to four times as much it is a great guitar for the value.This model has the cedar top.  I love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars.  It is a bit more mellow and has a hint of a classical guitar tone because of that.  If you prefer the bright concert sound of a Martin then you'll not want this cedar top.Yes this guitar has an oiled finish.  This allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded.  It also allows you to knock the heck out of it.  Funny thing is that after five years there isn't much damage just a little arm wear.  I think you'll like this guitar enough to not knock it around.The neck feels silky smooth.  The frets are well placed and don't stab you by hanging over the neck a little which is what you'll get in other guitars in this price range.  Paying to get the frets filed down is an additional expense on those competitors so beware when comparing.This doesn't come with a case so I bought a hard shell by the brand name ""Canadian"".  Great case.When I bought it it really didn't need an adjustment but I took it to a local shop to make it perfect for me.  I've also taken it in every other year for setting the action - checking and tweaking the neck - and getting the frets polished.  I also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in Chicago.  Performing these tasks will prolong the life of your Seagull and your enjoyment of it.--------------------Update: 10/13/2012 update of my 2010 review.  This guitar sounds even BETTER.  I went to a handful of guitar stores looking for another acoustic ""just for fun"" and I had a few bucks burning a hole in my pocket.  To my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior.  You see I learned that as you play a good wood guitar that over time it will ""open up"" and keep sounding better.  Yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of.  It will increase in value (to you at least)."
80142,"I have a fast growing cactus that I split and re-pot frequently. I usually use my own mix of dirt, sand, stones, and a bit of perlite.They always do well, but on the chance that they could do even better, I tried this ready mix.I suppose if you're in a hurry, this is nice, but after a month of side-by-side, there was absolutely no difference in growth or health."
80143,"This program was a bit scary at times, but it definitely gives you something to think about! I would like to see more of this it with Prime."
80144,"We got the universal-type wiper blade rather than the blade with a connector designed especially for our car. That means that the connector looks a little conspicuous -- bulky and out of place -- compared to the one on the old blade. It's not a big problem, but when there is not much to differentiate different replacement wiper blades, it may be a reason to try to get a version designed for your specific car.These wiper blades were easy to attach, and so far work fine. The studies I have read say all wiper blades tend to last about the same amount of time. It's hard to say how long these will last, but so far, so good."
80145,The show is a great comedy but I am very happy to see it come to a close. I think the writers should have wrapped it up in season 8. It really could have been great ending a year earlier with Ted meeting the mother much sooner. I think the long stretch irritated the viewers. The show is well worth watching to laugh but the material ended about a year ago.
80146,"Hi guys. Really simple little review here. This is a windscreen. It does windscreen things.Pros1. It works2. It fits my microphoneCons1. The package game a little smushed so it's a little misshapen.It's $2, it works. If it's not the highest quality stop complaining. It's $2, what did you expect, kevlar?"
80147,Great trimmming sissors for a great price.....Gets right in were i needto go to trim with out getting my hands dirty and snips off cleanly..Lovem
80148,"The restore feature is the best and most unique feature of this charger. It will bring batteries back form the dead (if you are patient). I have brought several dead 12V batteries back to everyday usefulness using the &#34;restore&#34; feature.  If it works just once, then chances are you have recovered your cost of this charger.Who knows if 8 step wave charging is better than plugging your battery into the Northeast Grid and pressing 'fry'? I've never had a problem with any 'smart' charger cooking a 12V battery. This CTEK does however, seem to be built better than the other chargers I've had over the years. This is my third 7002. The other two have seen 24/7 duty for years and still work as new.Just remember this is a &#34;maintenance&#34; charger. It will not repeal the laws of physics.  It puts out 7amps max, and though it's enough juice to 'maintain' even large truck batteries, it's not powerful enough for emergency starting (don't expect that &#34;12V&#34; setting to do anything but maintain computer memory).  The restore feature has to charge the battery first, so a full restore cycle will take multiple HOURS. If you're in a hurry to jump a dead battery, you'll need way more than 7 amps to get quick results."
80149,So far season 7 of Doctor Who has been mediocre at best but the latest episode hopefully is a sign that this season is getting more intense. And with the 50th anniversary coming up. Steve needs to blow all of us fans away! Can't wait to see what's in store for 2013:)!
80150,"Ordered this after reading reviews. I was very surprised and happy with the results. I have a 2012 Passat. One thing that attracted me to the car was the spoke wheels. I paid for the upgrade and immediately forgot they were on the car. It's an age thing, I take care of my cars but my condition dictates a limited time for work that requires being bent over. I've been washing the spokes and outer rim all along but forgot the polished deep dish part of the wheel. I just finished using product with a soft wheel brush for the first time and was shocked to rediscover the effect of clean highly polished deep dish spoke wheels. I sprayed it on, let it sit a minute, brushed the surfaces, hosed it off, wiped it down, done. No mussel required. Works wonderfully. P.S.  I bought the cheap Griot's Garage  15704 well wand (brush) purchased here along with this Sonax. Perfect combo for me but no two wheels are alike. Choose the right brush."
80151,Our three year old loves this show. It leaves her wanting to try the different  arts and crafts shown on the show.
80152,I am installing these on a 02 chevy avalanche 1500 5.3L v8. they are a exact replacement of oem. AC Delco all the way... good stuff.
80153,"From beginning to end, the realization of this time period and poverty. Along with class standards and lack of morality."
80154,"(do not read if you have not watched the first part - last episode)Now we know that the Doctor has something big coming up. A bullet - or a beam - from something, and the things in the shadows to boot. You cannot recall them and yet one was there, and it told Amy Pond she would reveal them. Then there was the odd place that River and Rory went, underneath the secret streets. as The Doctor says, this is not fighting an invasion because it was already here. it is creating a revolution. With Richard Nixon and his sidekick in tow, it seems that things have gone bad and the others are being hunted while the Doctor has a bad time. you know the doctor, however, and how good he is.This episode wraps up a first piece and explains what the enemy well be. I do not want to say so I will omit it, but I did not expect the name. I also did not expect the man and his love and Nixon and the kid, and I did not expect Amy and the revelation she had. I think she has something big coming and people have yet to notice.The acting is great here. Matt Smith has settled into the doctor and has his guy down pat. It makes me laugh, he has such an energetic humor, and I like that. I also liked the dark here and I thought they had plenty of it. The not seeing and not knowing, the marks on the arms; it added in and made a horror.The VOD is great here, too, and added together it well gets its 5/5. Thank you."
80155,I used to use RTV to help hold my gaskets down. Only issue with that is the next time you change the gasket you have to scrape all the RTV off to make sure you have a clean mounting surface for the next new gasket. Worse is that is you get to aggressive with your razor or gasket scraper you can scrape or gouge small scratches in the metal mating surfaces requiring you to have to use some type of RTV to help the new gasket seal the scratches you just left in the metal or risk leaks making their way through the scrapes you left behind. Get this and put a thin coat on the pan and the gasket give it a few min to set up and you'll be good. The gasket will stay in place and you will not have to worry about the gasket shifting or worse having to drop the pan again because the bolt holes for all the holes are covered by a shifting gasket.
80156,They do work. Exactly as advertised. Hane no fear on buying these. Fit the 2006 chevy silverado WT tailgate rods.
80157,"Three Norwegian college students made this documentary as a film studies project. We know them only by their first names, Kalle, Johanna and Thomas. Although this film was given the unfortunate name, Troll Hunter, it is primarily a disturbing educational experience. Some of what a viewer sees might seem unnecessarily bloody and frightening, but this is what these students found after they attached themselves to a reclusive, surly bear hunter. I will only say that this man, Hans, and his superior, Mr. Finn Haugen, worked for the Norwegian Wildlife Board. As we and the students later learn the men actually were employees of the secret government agency, the Norwegian Troll Security Service (TSS). This agency, it turned out, was created to kill trolls and hide their existence. Outlandish? You must watch this documentary film. This film was released only after the students disappeared and their work was discovered by the side of a road.The film is presented as it was discovered, from snips and pieces made by the students. Kalle was the cameraman, Johanna was responsible for the audio, Thomas was the on-camera commentator. We do not know their last names, only that they were students from Dottmar College. They were three young people dedicated to their project, sometimes frightened but with a deep desire to learn and to record the truth. They have never been seen again, and we do not know their fate. Many suspect the TSS might be involved since it since has been learned that the TSS has been attempting to cover-up the existence of trolls for many years. This was discovered only inadvertently when the Norwegian prime minister, Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, inadvertently confirmed the existence of trolls during a press conference.In the course of these students' film we encounter the Tosserlad, the Jotnar and a group of young Ringlefinches, all huge beasts with gigantic noses, long arms and covered with filthy hair. We see how gigantic are these beasts, towering over forests and wreaking destruction as they move. We learn that their inability to convert vitamin D into calcium makes them vulnerable to turning into stone in sunlight as their bodies over-react to UV rays. Unfortunately, (because of the likelihood of sensationalism), the students also record terrifying chases through dense dark woods, bloody encounters and frightening suspense. There is the sacrifice of a goat to snare, I believe, a ringlefinch. The young goat bleats its fear.Some of what the students filmed simply is not appropriate for children. Indeed, even the preparations for approaching these creatures might seem too disgusting for family viewing. The application of trollstench, particularly to the armpits and groins, is vulgar. This substance is so foul to the nostrils that gagging usually is induced. Trollstench is prepared by cooking down the difficult-to-collect bodily wastes of trolls. This, however, is essential if one is to disguise one's own scent, particularly if one is a Christian. Trolls are enraged by Christians. Yet as fearsome as these huge beasts are, they are susceptible to disease. This might be, the students learn, the cause of troll rage.Kalle, Johanna and Thomas framed their story around Hans, the trolljegeren (or troll hunter). Hans might not be as reliable as the students think. Yet Hans undoubtedly knows his trollsCall Troll Hunter what you will - a documentary, cinema verite, or simply a student college film project. It remains a remarkable record. Any who have managed to watch that other classic documentary, Forgotten Silver, will not regret watching this."
80158,Very interesting to see the methods different people use to PREPARE for the day the SHTF.  Though this series a family could get some great ideas to incorporate into their own prudent preparation for emergencies or the SHTF day.
80159,"I have been using the Battery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Charger for years to keep the batteries on my motorcycles charged and in optimal condition extend their life.  This is important, especially if you life in colder climates where you can not ride all year long.I purchased a few extra terminal harnesses for my ride mower, walk behind and portable generator so I can charge them as well.  Once the harness is installed it make charging effortless, no more having to pull batteries, charge them, and then re-install once complete.  Its so easy there are no excuses for not keeping your batteries in tip-top shape!"
80160,"This had to be designed by someone who understood the need for well-placed lighting for those who need to read sheet music while performing. the flexible necks allow you to quickly twist and aim the light 'just right' over two open pages. The battery operation is nice if you want to be portable, but I have found that the AC adapter (Mine came with the light, check to be sure you get one with yours) is the way to go if you have a piano or keyboard in place where you practice every day. My Duracell batteries ran down quickly, over a few weeks before I noticed the light becoming slightly less and less. The AC adapter keeps the power flowing and the lights at full brightness. The whole unit is light enough to clip onto a music stand back or to a music book that you place other sheet music in front of. I needed to buy an extension cord as the AC adapter cord is only about 6 feet long, and while that sounds like a lot, by the time you lay it out where you want it (out of the way to avoid tripping) you might need to add an extension cord too. I understand the LED's themselves last a long long time, so that is good, they operate at a very cool low temperature so no hazard there. All in all, these do the job, illuminating with a pleasant easy to read-by light."
80161,"I just wish Weber made stainless steel ones, the plating on these fails quickly and then rust sets in :-("
80162,"Wow, a show worthy of the Hannibal name! I love it.  Excellent show, I'll be waiting for more episodes, A+"
80163,this brush is the perfect size and has just the right amount of rigitity and softness to clean the many curves and hollows in my wheels.
80164,"This is a &#34;must have&#34; for your tool chest and protects those parts that are most likely to take a lot of water, snow, and salt."
80165,"Wow, season 5 of SouthLand was bitter sweet. I love this show and hate to see it end. I will miss these characters and actors. Season 5 had all the drama and craziness this show is known for, plus some funny moments. SouthLand has always reminded me of Adam 12 on steroids. If you are regular watcher of this series season 5 will not disappoint (except no season 6). If you never watched the show; however, like a gritty cop show this is the show for you. Start at the beginning with season 1. This is edge of seat TV."
80166,I really like these things.  I don't stick tape and stuff to guitar body which if they do make a double sided tape similar to post it notes might be a good idea.  Bought a few while back and just bought a few more.  If you drop a pick there is another right there.  Have fun.
80167,"The drama is very good as is the character conflicts. I would definitely love to see another season or too. The only negative is the flakey science, creating a worm portal across the galaxy with just a few kilos of U238...pulease. Star-faring aliens that just happen to be in human form, even genetically compatible...huh? These guys can make an airplane disappear, but they can't get out of a simple human jail in Alaska....really?"
80168,Great extension cord and it's really long! Perfect and long enough to reach anywhere in my SUV. Would recommend it.
80169,"This is just a fun over the top giant spider movie aka government secret project . I'm a huge fan of all types if horror and the animal films from the 80s is all I thought about while what hong this flick . The spider in this actually has a kind of personality to him and sets up traps for people as it continues to get big , bigger, and then BIG ASS SPIDER MODE , like I always say I don't give spoilers so if u have nothing to do and u are able to stream this little gem then by all means check it out ."
80170,Goes with mower yearly tuneup.The only problem I had was the bottle had a small hole in it. The box and other items I had ordered were soaked in oil. The bottle had leaked 2 oz.
80171,"I love this show. It is adult-themed, witty, and hilarious to watch. It streams extremely well with all of my devices. It is free to stream if you are a prime member."
80172,"The bulbs ""were"" great, didn't have the overly blue color many of the high end bulbs do and were noticeably brighter than the bulbs they replaced. However 1 bulb died after less than 3 months (and no I did not touch the bulbs during installation). So in the end I give them an ""A"" for effort but the still get an ""F"" overall."
80173,"Standing on the shoulders of the Wizard of Oz is not enough to make this show interesting. There's plenty of better/new ideas that warrant an entire show, like Tumbleaf."
80174,"This show is so good I have to give it 5 stars.  I love how vulnerable and believable the characters are- with all of their imperfections.  It's refreshing to see a show where different background and body types are represented- much like the real world where not everyone is a size 0.  In addition, the chemistry between he cast is great, they are a very funny and witty bunch.  LOVED the most recent episode where Mindy had her Christmas party in her apartment.  It had a really good ending."
80175,"I never liked gore or being scared so I had avoided this one. but it got such good reviews and I was looking for something. I loved it. The main character is not Hannibal, but an FBI agent. He is a very complicated but likable character. Lots of plot twists. It can be gory and disturbing but the plots and acting make up for it."
80176,i'm sure i will like it very much. i like all of the authors novels. now i have a face(that i like) to put to Harry' s carehcter
80177,"Been using these Wix filters for a few years for a Yaris and a RAV 4. They install very easily and they really do make a difference in the air coming out of the air conditioners. The filtered air has a fresh clean feel, and if you have allergies, these filters can make a positive difference with less sneezing, pressure and watery eyes. A plus is that Amazon sells them at rock-bottom prices and you get free delivery. What's not to like? Go to your dealership and you will pay at least triple for the filter and what amounts to a five or less minute installation. You decide."
80178,A high quality USA made product that is far superior to the OEM one. This is complete with hardware and fittings to replace the all in one OEM. the installation is quick and easy. A puller set or pickling fork will make this job a lot more palatable.
80179,I bought this because it was cheap and figured it can't be that bad. I was surprised that it was good. I had this and a shure mic with a professional singer and they couldn't tell the difference.
80180,"I wasn't sure about this pad until I got it. I thought it would be soft flimsy, boy was I wrong. This little pad is built to last. Its very sturdy and holds up under the weight of my Highlander."
80181,"I love my flower box holder! It's nice looking, has a simple, but pretty design and seems to be very sturdy. Easy to put together and attach to my deck railing. I love my plants, but don't have that much deck space to have them on the ground and no real place to hang the hanging kind so this is perfect. I tried putting individual pots in the holder first, it was fine, but then I got a rectangular holder like they show in the picture and I think it looks much better. I actually  put this in so it faces the inside of the deck rather than around the outside so I can enjoy the flowers more myself. I am planning to get a couple more since this one does look a little lonely. Nicely done CobraCo!"
80182,"I have been playing acoustic guitar and banjo for years and tried several tuners.  The Snark SN-1 is, by far, the best.  It is acurate and picks up the vibration of the low A and E strings without a problem."
80183,OK OK that really is a recommendation. The twist and turn of plots are fun and a surprise. Looking forward to next season.
80184,I purchased this exact model just to have easy access to turn on and off the propane tanks. This cover has to be fully assembled when you receive it but it is really easy to do with simple hand tools. Once assembles just adjust your twin propane tanks to be as far apart as possible and slide this cover on so it fits snug.
80185,"Not so great acting, and yet somehow the special effects are not so bad. I wont give anything away but the ending is poor I thought and it spoils everything good in the movie. The fight scenes with the girl are very poor, and it's tried to be helped by covering it up with good camera work. The movie was good if you only consider that it was done with very little money. Compare it to Hollywood biggies and this will always be on the short side by comparison. I LOVE good movies and great acting so this film didn't move me so much but....a good start for them in this industry."
80186,I made a rookie mistake and bought this assuming it worked on American vehicles and never read anything in the ad that mentioned otherwise. I general work on GM and Ford vehicles. Totally useless for me unless I can do some sort of modification to it and download other software. Probably not worth my time
80187,I've been using this filter on my 99 Corolla for the last few oil changes. Switched to this filter based on testing results I had read online which seemed to indicate the PureONE lines are fairly effective. Have not had any problems.
80188,"I hastily ordered the Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer thinking that since it's for organic gardening, I would be able to spray this on my vegetable garden.  Being that there are warnings on the packaging, I contacted Havahart and received the following reply:""Thank you for contacting Havahart regarding Deer Off and I apologize for the confusion.  The new labeling does state not to place it directly on the edible plant.  The following statement is the one reason that we state not to use it when it will be consumed by humans:This product contains egg solids which may cause allergic reactions in some individuals. Do not allow spray to drift onto plants intended for human consumption.This is why we do not suggest using it on edible plants is there are a quite a few people out there with egg allergies and that can cause issues.We suggest putting a barrier around the garden area or the area you want to protect.  All-natural DeerOff II is the only deer, rabbit and squirrel repellent that is OMRI Listed and compliant for use in organic gardening. Most importantly, it's specifically designed for safe use around children and pets.""Since the concern is the egg content and I have no allergies to eggs, I sprayed the product around but not directly onto the plants in my garden.  I also sprayed the wire fence that the deer jump over in order to gain access into my community garden plot.The scent of deer scat was more offensive to me than the Havahart Deer Off II.  Although I wish the deer, rabbits and whatever four legged creatures that invade my space would eat the weeds and not everything I like to eat, I've seen no evidence that they were enjoying my buffet after the application.  In all honesty, I'm not sure if other gardeners are now providing them with more desirable morsels than my meager garden offers.  Since many deer have been displaced in my northern Virginia community by the Beltway expansion, they have been devouring the landscaping in my community.  I've also sprayed a bit around some severely affected areas and this stuff appears to work.I've noticed that the price has been reduced in the past couple days and I'm not surprised since it's also on sale at the Havahart website.  At the current price, I can recommend the repellant and might add that the battery operated spray sure makes the application easy.  I haven't had to change the enclosed batteries and expect that they will last through this jug.  If you're allergic to eggs, be especially careful when handling the liquid, but otherwise, I think we are safe."
80189,"This is a great way to keep your generator(s) clean. The oil drains without getting all over the plastic and makes for easy filling, just tilt the machine on its side and pour in your pre-measured amount of oil. The aluminum is very easy to clean up with some carb or brake cleaner. Though I recommend keeping the carb or brake cleaner away from the O-ring."
80190,I loooove the character of the mother and think the actor/character totally live up to the legend. Shes perfect.  The season slowed my interest slowed midseason but first and last episodes totally banging.
80191,"Never seen grim before until amazon offered on the stream service. looked into it and its a great series.  Amazon is on its way up with its streaming services, quality is great. Look out netflix"
80192,"This is my 6 year old's review of this show.  This was a good show, I liked it very much.  The dog showed the other dog how to make friends.  The other dog was very happy to have friends in the teeny tiny club.  The other dog was accepted with all the teeny tiny dogs and this is what I thought was nice."
80193,"I replaced my stock radiator in my Nissan 370Z with the Mishimoto radiator. I added about a half this bottle when completing my install. I'm sure the all aluminum radiator is performing well, however, I feel this product has made a difference in keeping temps down and lubricating the internal parts as well."
80194,This show never disappoints me. My favorite episode so far is &#34;the gang tries to win an award&#34;. Best non-animated comedy series ever.
80195,"i purchased the .38mm and these (.46mm).  after using the .38mm and learning how to use the pick now i feel better using these.  i like the small amount of texture provided in the grip area.  not too much, but at least something."
80196,"The contour wiper blade works well at removing water during light to moderate rainstorms (no heavy rain yet this year!) and keeps the windshield sparkling when used with the automatic washer. In terms of functionality, this is a win.However, my husband wasn't impressed with the connector and the fit between it and the wiper blade. If we lived in an area with frequent heavy rains or strong windstorms, I don't think we would be using it as it didn't leave us feeling 100% comfortable about its security. However, given our driven habits and weather situation, it will be good enough though we won't pick up a replacement wiper of this type in the future."
80197,"Fiskars has made excellent gardening tools for many years. These pruning shears are well designed, perfectly weighted, and fantastic gardening tools.We Alaskans have a very long growing season-(midnight sun) and as our plants grow very well, they produce a lot of flowers. Dead-heading and pruning is clearly beneficial for any garden, perhaps more so in the Land of Exuberant Summertime Growth.Make rapid progress tirelessly at one of your gardens necessary and critical chores.Your hands don't tire as readily. Use less force to efficiently get the work done.These shears are a delight.  Worth every penny as they make your chores easier."
80198,"When I bought this pedal I was thinking a heavy distortion. But when I got it and played with it I figured out it was alot different that advertised. It is a acdc, Steve Vaughn kind of pedal. It's got an attitude but it soft at the same time. It's truly a one of a kind product. I would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal. Make a note it is not a metal pedal. Not by any means actually. But for what it is it is fantastic."
80199,"I agree with the one-star review titled ""Pointless"" written by ""Kitten Kisser"".  I live in an area that falls between the last two categories ""Rural residential"" and ""Rural non-residential agricultural"" - I have high deer density, damage is frequent but unpredictable.  Since I installed them, I haven't seen any deer in my yard, but my schedule has been erratic, so it's not unusual.  I've seen deer damage on plants near one of the three repellent stakes, but not near the other two.  But then, I don't know if I would have seen damage on those plants if the stakes were not there.I will continue to re-scent the stakes, at least as long as the supply lasts.  And I'll move the stakes, as the instructions say.  But since my walnut tree got partly eaten, I don't have high hopes for these stakes doing the job."
80200,"These aren't just great for your car, they're great for around the house also.  I keep one in the glove box and use the others for cleaning my granite counters or washing windows.  The cloths are soft, large and high quality."
80201,"Miller establishes his character's quirkiness from the start. It's nice to see Lucy Liu with an actual character to develop. And the always watchable Aidan Quinn gives us a subtle  New York accent. Not bad for a Chicago boy, an underrated talent."
80202,"My tomatoes were starting to look half dead, so I bought this fertilizer to give to it. I gave it a full tablespoon, within a few days they were putting out a bunch of new growth, you would never think they were almost dead! As of today they are extreme healthy and growing like crazy.Hopefully I can enter these into a contest."
80203,"This worked just as described. I would recommend using a couple gallons of water with your mix of Meguiar's for an SUV sized vehicle, especially if you use the recommended wash mitts. It cleaned well and rinsed off easily."
80204,"ID is great!  Sometimes I can't help but laugh at some of the stupidity of these convicts. On the other hand, some are scary smart. It always amazes me when some get away for years and years and still somehow get caught. I think they get too comfortable."
80205,"I'm not on tour with any group.  I play for church, and every couple of weeks for a local nursing home (with other musicians willing to give their time) plus an occasional 'gig' for a town celebration or some such activity.  I've got a few sound effects pedals and processors I like using, but not enough to warrant buying your typical pedal board that holds 6 or more such devices and takes up a lot of trunk space in the car.  This 'mini' PedalTrain easily holds four of my favorite devices, it is built for extreme durability without being too heavy, etc.  The case is awesome, too.... heavy duty,...good stuff.  The board came with velcro, tie wraps, power head, etc to mount and use your devices.  I had it up and running in a few minutes,...and it makes my travel-and-play experiences easy, without looking for a 'roadie' to get help.  The angle of the mounting surface of the board relative to floor surface is perfect.  Clearances for passing the wiring through from device to device is also perfect.  Since I first got it, I've 'rearranged' once already.  Talk about easy.  You'll be glad to have your sound effects mounted, wired, and movable as a unit so as to reduce setup time and the wear/tear on wires from just handling."
80206,"These are my favorite guitars strings, they last a long time, bend well, hold great sound, and you won't have to tune your guitar every five minutes like some strings."
80207,"Fun! Great concept, expands to a very usable size. I can see how these could come in handy in hundreds of ways. A quick spritz of hand sanitizer and you have yourself a disinfectant wipe. Got kids/pets/spills/dirty car? This could be what you've been looking for. Not to mention that they're so lightweight - ideal for travel, and particularly in a foreign country. Highly recommended."
80208,Stories are good and just the right duration. It is good at the end they let you know if the person was convicted or waiting for trial.
80209,"I hung this up close to the back of the house and boy did it stink of that smell exclusive to rotting trash. Because of that, I was sure that this would work, but it's been out there for weeks now and only has about five flies in it. I find this strange, given that I had the open trash can sitting quite near it while we had work done inside the home and there were large families of flies hovering above for days.The trap is easy enough to put together--fill it with water up to the line and make sure the lid is sitting on it right so that there is room for the flies to fly in. The string it hangs on it long enough to put on a branch.I think the sticky fly strips work better than this."
80210,I think I could get hooked.  Lots of great actors from other shows I enjoyed.  Hurry up and produce more episodes.
80211,I came across this show by chance on Amazon.I am glad I did! It is like a mix of X-files (w/o the aliens) & Alcatraz . Highly recommended
80212,"We have used one time and there was no bad smells from black water... #1 only, no #2..."
80213,"This is a very good program.  Not only is there a plot to the story, but there is some mystery as well as humor.  You are ready for the next episode so you can pick up where the story left off.  I would recommend this program."
80214,"Just make sure you measure the distance between the tires as they make 2 different sizes. The larger one would never have fit my trailer. I have found the more stable my trailer, the more comfortable it is."
80215,"I have replaced nearly every accessory light on every vehicle I own, including my RV trailer.  They're most efficient at saving power, so I replaced every bulb on my trailer with these.  I had extras left over, and began to replace all the similar bulbs with these LED type.  Since they save volts, you can extrapolate that they'll cause your alternator less strain to keep you 12 volt system topped up.  That means better fuel economy.  I'm not sure that the amount of fuel that is saved can be easily measured, but it has to be something.  Additionally, these things last nearly forever, so when you replace that burned out bulb, that will be the last time you'll have to do it."
80216,"This kit has every kind of screw, spacer or adapter a man could want to mount a licence plate bracket or license plate. Worth the money, get one today!"
80217,all I can say is wow. my Porsche never looked so hot hot hot!.totally recommended. buy it now! its well worth it!
80218,Quirky and yet surprisingly likable folk populate this pilot.  I would like to see the characters again because I suspect I'm in for some surprises.
80219,"""Damages"" is that kind of show that has you on the edge of your seat  completely confused as to what is going to happen next and in utter surprise when you discover each piece of the truth. It was one of the best shows of last season without a doubt. The show centered around Ellen (Byrne), who begins to work in the lawfirm of Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) who is a ruthless, self-serving and completely unpredictable lawyer. She focuses her work on a class action lawsuit against Arthur Frobisher (amazingly played by Danson) for insider trading. The first scene of the first episode shows Ellen running half naked in a raicoat covered in blood in the streets of New York. In each episode we discover a new piece of the puzzle and the events that led to that first scene. The past/present technique is masterfully used making each viewer very involved in solving the mystery. The performance of actors is excellent and the show is amazing. Damages is truly a great show."
80220,"""The Orphanage"" is a rare horror film whose strong emotions and believable motives make it a tear jerker as well as a supernatural thriller. Laura (Belen Rueda) spent half of her childhood in an orphanage on Spain's coast, before she was adopted. As an adult, she returns to the enormous and beautiful home, long since fallen into disuse, with her physician husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and 7-year-old son Simon (Roger Princep). The couple intend to re-open the establishment as a home for disabled children. But Simon's temperament is becoming belligerent, and he is fast accumulating imaginary friends. Then he disappears without a trace.This is a ghost story, but, in spite of its supernatural elements, ""The Orphanage"" has a rigorous logic. I appreciated that, as horror films so often get sloppy with their narratives. The story is propelled forward by two strong emotions: fear of whatever lurks in the house and Laura's fierce maternal love. Laura takes the audience with her on frantic searches for clues, which give the film an action movie pace and emotional immediacy between the thoughtful lulls. At the halfway point, I thought the film lost its pacing and went off the rails until I realized that the film -and the audience's perception of it- pivots at that point. Then I was impressed by the well-conceived structure.Director J.A. Bayona, writer Sergio G. Sanchez, cinematographer Oscar Faura, and editor Elena Ruiz, amazingly, are all working on their first feature film. Bayona harkens back to the best years of Hollywood genre filmmaking by creating the orphanage completely on a soundstage. It's a stunning set and a wonderful character in the movie. They go easy on the score and try to tell the story visually as much as possible. Belen Rueda makes us feel her anguish, desperation, and fear at the loss of her son. ""The Orphanage"" is top-notch gothic horror, comparable to the best psychological thriller/horror films that have come out of Asia in recent years. In Spanish with optional subtitles.The DVD (New Line 2008): ""When Laura Grew Up: Constructing the Orphanage"" (16 min) interviews director, producers, writer, cast, et al about characters and themes, acting with children, the set, digital effects, and the score. ""Tomas' Secret Room: The Filmmakers"" (10 min) is a documentary in 5 parts about various aspects of production: the crew, the score, the orphanage, digitally effects, the title sequence. ""Horror in the Unknown: Make-up Effects"" (9 min) interviews the make-up artists about Tomas, Laura's leg, and Begnina's make-up. In ""Rehearsal Studio: Cast Auditions and Table Read"" (3 min), the director talks about working with the actors. There are 6 Still Galleries of 198 sketches and photos. ""Marketing Campaign"" includes 2 Spanish trailers, 2 US trailers, and 12 posters. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish."
80221,"What a brilliant surprise! I can't believe I didn't hear about this show sooner. Christopher Guest is the director/creator of this very funny show starring  Chris O'Dowd (from the amazing show Moone Boy-watch it right away if you haven't), Nina Conti and her monkey (I LOVE her/them), Michael McKean and many more. What more could you want? I am so excited to have discovered this. I own all of Christopher Guest' movies and to see him doing tv with such a top notch cast makes me so happy. If I could give this more than five stars I would. Highly recommended! Oh, if only all of television was this smart."
80222,"Use it every time I restring my guitar, works really good. I recommend this to any musician that plays regulary."
80223,"Mount this cup holder anyplace.  Prevent spills and keep drinks handy.  Also, the fold down tray catches condensation to prevent water from damaging surfaces.  When not in use, it folds up and out of the way.  Made to mount to a vertical surface like a wall."
80224,I have a shed in my back yard that is a spider magnet. I have not seen any evidence of mice or rats but there are spiders galore and some other types of insects. I placed one each of these trays on the top shelf of opposite sides of the shed. The spiders are not able to resist checking out these trays and they can keep on checking until the try is full and I throw it in the trash.It is a pleasure to be able to retrieve an item from the shed that is not covered with cobwebs. Go sticky!
80225,This did not disappoint. Can't wait to watch more. I love having a female star in the major role. Good to watch anytime.
80226,This was as good as season 1!!! I snoozed a bit in season 7 yet this one i couldn't put down. Great. Just great! Episode 17 broke my heart. I thought they did a great job with this season and the final episode. It is on the edge of your seat kinda season.  It was a great show if tears come up when it's about to be over.
80227,"&#34;Sometimes you just have to hold on to whatever you can.&#34; Nolan Hayes (Walker) and his wife Abigail (Rodriguez) are rushed to the hospital with pregnancy complications. Nolan is told he has a new baby girl who is having breathing problems and that his wife didn't make it. While he is trying to process this information the hospital begins to show signs of stress and panic. The doctor tells Nolan that his daughter must stay on the breathing machine for 48 hours, just when Nolan thinks he has had all he can take Hurricane Katrina hits. Before I started this my thought was, another Paul Walker movie...how can he do this without a car? Almost immediately I was sucked into the movie and didn't turn away until the end. This was not over-the-top or really that unbelievable and even though things kept getting worse I never once felt that they went too far. The movie stayed fast paced and tense the entire time and it was hard to look away from. The only problem I had with the movie (keep in mind I'm not 100% sure if this happened or not) was that almost instantly it seemed like New Orleans turned into something out of Mad Max, gunmen showing up and foraging for food and thinking killing is all of a sudden legal. Except for that aspect, which is only a small part, the movie was great and this is easily Paul Walkers best work. It makes me wonder if he wasn't in the crash if he would have made more of this type of movie or stay with &#34;I have car, I go fast&#34; movies. Overall, if you liked The Impossible you will love this one. A great movie to memorialize Walker with. If I was him this is the one I would want to be remembered for. I give this an A."
80228,"5 minutes and a Phillips screwdriver was all I needed to install this igniter on my 2002 Weber Genesis Silver B gas grill.  The replacement is really snap-together simple, with the screwdriver only needed for removing the faceplate from the grill so that the old igniter could be accessed.My only complaint was that one of the two plastic tabs that holds the igniter in place broke off.  This was due in part to my own clumsiness, but the tabs did seem rather flimsy compared to those of the old igniter.  But learn from my mistake: I thought the tabs needed to be stretched out a little in order to hold the igniter in place.  Instead, all I really needed to do was put the igniter in place and turn it slightly.  Once turned, the tabs will hold the igniter securely."
80229,"By the end of this second season opener, we know the basic reason the older Alex sent a message to his younger self, and has arranged at least some of the events we saw in the first season.Judging by this episode, it looks like this season will be even better than the first."
80230,This show captivated my attention from the beginning! All of the cast are well suited for their roles and give a very believable performance. The pilot starts out right away with action and a story that has substance. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys historical fiction.
80231,"I&#8217;m not sure exactly how to rate these picks except to say they&#8217;re what they are. Guitar picks. However, the price was good."
80232,"We all have the needs to sweep after edging and mowing but I didn't even realize that one unit can do both sweeping and vacuuming. My property looks so much neater now after being able to vac debris out of corners on the front porch rather than blow. I love that this is rechargeable as well. I plan to buy a pool home this year, so this will be wonderful to remove debris and leaves from the area rather than just blow it around."
80233,"L&O; Criminal Intent is one of my favorite Cop ShowsI'd put it in my top 5 without a Doubt!This season was a tad differentMostly due to NBC's lack of Passion for this Great Cop/Crime Dramascenes look different,  it has this  very different looking Neon Color patternMusic starts every episode  (It very much tries to look and feel like CSI) But, it's still CIThank God I don't understand CSI at all (it's a super Lazy Cop show) yes it's a insane ratings machinesBut, in my defense so is A&E;'s Duck DynastyEven though it tries to borrow tacky gimmicks made famous by CSI  (It still has great writing and acting)This season is without a doubt a re-boot in a wayThe events of Season 5 changed lots of NYPD's Major Case SquadCaptain  DeakinsCaptain  Deakins was forced out due to trying to protect Detective LoganA.D.A.  CarverSeason 5 is so good if you are gona start on this show start with Season 5also Annabella Sciorra as  Detective Carolyn Barek  are all written out  (which is a shame I really liked her)I don't like the fact there was no explanation why Both  Carver & Barek are gone??Eric Bogosian & Julianne Nicholson join the castBoth do add plenty to the show...Big fan of  Eric Bogosian but, he's really not likeable in this season due to the fact his Character is by the book and don't understand or support his two best DetectivesThis season is Detective Mike Logan's season he is in 70% of this seasonThis is Chris Noth's best performance imoGoren & Eames are not featured like usualBut, every episode they are in are  very smart and well writtenThe episode  &#34;Endgame&#34;  with the late Roy Scheider is brilliant and as crazy as it sounds this episode should be a Huge reason why you buy this season it's that strong in every possible waybut, that is not the only great episode this season has some really great onesCriminal Intent IMO is the best Law&Order;if it wasn't for CI there would be no Elementary i'm sure of that9.2/10"
80234,"But, Dr. Wade makes it an adventure. THAT'S what I DO like.  And I love his way of attacking problems, and willingness to abandon his usual, familiar gear and try what ever it takes. He doesn't give up easily. Dr. Wade is the right man for this job.Edit:I just watched the episode about the ""LOCH NESS Monster""... This one takes Dr. Wade FAR afield from the original concept... That being, what, if anything, IS in the famous Loch (Lake) in Scotland? It's taking on a LOT, as this has to be one of the MOST studied bodies of water in history! And Dr. Wade doesn't disappoint. He goes where he must, does what it takes, and in the end... Well, does he get his 'Fish'? Or is it all a myth? You watch and decide. For a couple of bucks, it's well worth it. Best episode yet, and that's saying something, I've seen EVERY single one so far."
80235,all I did was watch the trailer. It did not sound really all that interesting. Did not add it to my watch list.
80236,I bought it for my Acura rsx hatchback to keep it covered while in vacations but found out that the cover does not cover the whole car it only fits up to just above the tires. But at least it covered  most of the car so I was not totally disappointed and protects the car.
80237,"At first glance, I believed that this planter was going to me a bit more substantial.  The reality is that it is purely a decorative piece.  Upon opening of the small box, I was shocked on how it fit.  Then I slowly pulled the accordion apart and was let down.  Not a big let down, but just a bit after my initial excitement.Here's why:  The color is of a rotting, moldy wood.  Very reminiscent of old beach boardwalks or fishing decks.  You can see it now, right?  The wood and cuts are very rudimentary and put together with little black nails.  The wood appears as if it would give a mean splinter and my husband can attest to that just from removing from the box.  Can you take it apart?  YES.  It seems homemade!  There is nothing wrong with something having the appearance of being different and not commercially made, but for some reason I didn't believe that this item would arrive being so.. so... rustic.  That is a perfect description.  This item is rustic.You will want to bring it outside, to your patio/garden/balcony etc, but will decide against it because you see that it will surely fall apart after a New York Summer/Autumn season.  You will end up placing it on a window sill (if there is adequate room) or placing it away for storage.  This is an item that you have to truly feel and see in your local garden center before purchasing.Finally, it is small!  The compartments are enough for small herbs that are starting out.  Make sure to keep the plastic inserts because there are no drainage holes.  If you are lucky you may fit 6-8 small pots.  Very small pots...Recommend if you can really grasp the aesthetic that this item evokes.  If you love that natural, homemade, rustic charm then you will not be disappointed.  If you want something for outside, then please look elsewhere.  This is just a decorative holder that isn't so decorative at the end of the day.  Seriously... you probably built one of these bad boys in shop class back in the (insert decade here) when they used to have shop class.  At least that is what television programs have always shown me. :)"
80238,my many times getting wet testing this thing proves that it works. I would buy this again if I ever need another one.
80239,"First of all, I really like the looks of this lantern.  I placed mine on a mosaic stand that I have between 2 rocking chairs on my front porch.  It really looks nice.I had a little issue with putting the lantern together -- meaning that I had problems with opening and inserting the scent package.  It warns you not to get it on your skin.  Well, it is very awkward getting it into place (I ended up having to break off / cut off tabs on it to get it to fit in place).  It wouldn't set right at first, so to get it into place I ended up with the oil all over my hands.  I discovered (from research), that it's not toxic.  However, it feels terrible.  Can't even describe it properly.  It didn't just feel like oil, but it had a very strange feeling.The smell isn't bad.  It reminds me of citronella candles, which means that it has a slightly fruity but odd smell.  When you turn on the lantern, there is a fan that blows the scent around the area.  It also has a nice glowing light.  However, I quickly learned that the light is a MAJOR problem if you use it at night.  Since the scent / mosquito repellent only works within a close distance, you have to keep the light close to you.  So, if you have it turned on while in the dark, the light attracts every flying insect in the area!!!  Maybe the scent keeps away the mosquitos, but you are bombarded with all kinds of other bugs.  Very annoying."

80241,This product enables those who have difficulty bending down to be able to work in the garden effectively and with ease.  It is easy to set up and collapse for storage.  It was priced fairly.
80242,"Rebecca (Sarah Bolger) is a student of an all-girls boarding school. The 16-year-old girl is also a daughter of a famous poet who died a tragic death. Thanks to her best friend and roommate Lucie (Sarah Gadon), Rebecca almost recovers from the past when a new student Ernessa (Lily Cole) arrives.Rebecca thinks there is something strange about Ernessa (who is never seen eating anything). With the arrival of his beautiful and mysterious girl, Rebecca's friendship with Lucie starts to wither. Not only that; weird things start to happen, but is this because of Ernessa, or just a figment of Rebecca's wild imagination?I have not read the original book by Rachel Klein, but the story is obviously inspired by ""Carmilla"" (1872), a novella written by Sheridan Le Fanu, and to a lesser degree, Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" (1897). I believe the original story has several subtexts as in these Gothic classics, but screenwriter/director Mary Harron (""American Psycho"") handles these elements clumsily.The film feels rushed in many ways. The three characters Rebecca, Lucie and Ernessa are not fully developed. Rebecca's relationship with the school's handsome English teacher (Scott Speedman) doesn't convince. This is supposed to be a dark fantasy with a heroine who is not entirely reliable, but the film itself lacks wit or psychological insight, anything that would make the predictable story interesting.Having said that, I still enjoyed watching the film for what it is, especially Declan Quinn's moody photography and impressive Lily Cole, perfectly cast as the enigmatic Ernessa."
80243,I love it!! I can't wait for Season 2. I was really glad they didn't kill off anyone I liked.
80244,"I watched and read this book (the first of a series) to see if it was too inappropriate for my 13 year old niece.  It is a little more raunchy (especially the book) than I would prefer for a 13 year old.  But I would think a young woman at the end of high school or beginning of college might appreciate this level of teen angst.  The areas where the girls have to deal with heavy kissing and groping are the areas that I felt were a bit too much for my niece.  But it does not overpower the whole book.  I found the book and movie rather funny, and I think I will recommend it for her in a few years."
80245,This is a very good grill brush. It cleaned the grill quite well. I like the long handle and the bristles were a pleasant change from the wire bristle brushes on the market (those bristles can come off and be deadly). I might suggest that they make the bristles a little longer as some grill grates are thicker. The cost is reasonable and the brush works great. I received the product free of charge for my honest opinion (no compensation).
80246,The second season shows the kids all grown up.  It is a little confusing especially when you see 3 batmans or 3 flashes.  Was kinda hard to tell who was who from the first season.
80247,"I am addicted to this series, possibly because I find Kevin Whatley's character so appealing as he interacts with his scholarly counterpart to solve intriguing crimes.  The academic atmosphere of the setting alone is enough to hold the viewer's attention and acts as a character in the plot.  A nice mixture of crime drama and subtle humor."
80248,This show is very good and exciting. Love the way the characters interact. Funny how all different types of people are drawn in.
80249,"I have two dogs so I have lots of dust and pet dander everywhere, all the time.  When I drag a regular cloth towel over, say, the dashboard of my car, all it does is make the dust and dander float around for a bit and then settle back down.  With these, all that crud just vanishes into the cloth.  Seriously.  It's magic.  I had the same problem in the car with my regular and dark glasses; they always had crud on them.  I'd wipe them but all that would do is move the crud around on the lens.  One lick with these and it's just gone.They are washable and you get a bunch of them.  I now have them strategically placed in the car console, the drawer next to my black smooth stovetop (which shows dust badly), in the bathroom.  If you have any kind of dust, pollen, pet dander issues these are a must have."
80250,"Much better than the OEM plastic idler pulley. Only time will tell if this will last any longer than the OEM unit, but I'm pretty sure it will. Pain in the butt to replace - but if yours is making noise, you'd better replace it soon. I've read too many horror stories about the idler pulley seizing up, and being thrown through the timing cover, damaging the timing belt."
80251,"The central characters of Holder and Sarah are very well done - they have flaws and addiction issues that feed well into the seedy world they are investigating. It's good that the plots are more intricate and as a viewer, you are required to think. Top notch TV, well worth seeing -- after you watch season 1, of course!!!"
80252,"I was given a sample Roll of 3Ms Wrap and Repair Silicone Tape (1in x 2 yd) to test and evaluate. I repaired a leaking water hose, a leaking kitchen gasket before calling the plumber. I taped the handle of my shovel that was giving me wood splinters, and taped my finger for a day for good measure. I was very happy with all results. No residue or wear was left on my finger.Silicon is a remarkable substance. Wikipedia notes that silicon provides minimal heat conduction, toxicity and chemical reactivity. It repels water and can form watertight seals. It is resistant to oxygen, ozone, ultraviolet light and microbial growth. It is stable over a wide range of temperatures. It can be used as electrical insulation and has some fire protection properties. It is highly gas permeable. It sticks to glass. This product sticks to itself when tightly stretched.What this means to me is that I can:* Carefully, and not too tightly, temporarily wrap it directly around a wound on my body or repair a medical cast being careful not to cut off circulation.* Repair glazing seals since silicon sticks well to glass* Repair gaskets, hoses and leaking pipes around my car, lawn irrigation, pool and general plumbing whether outdoors or indoors. Whether I decide it to be a semi-permanent or temporary fix will depend on how lucky I feel.* Use it when I am missing electrical tape* Repair a broken wooden handle on my hammer, shovel, frying pan or anywhere else a more comfortable grip is needed.The packaging label reads:""Repair hose, tool, pipe or electrical surfaces with this super stretchy, highly conformable, adhesive-free tape that fuses strongly to itself and can withstand extreme temperatures -85F to 500F. Designed to be heat, friction, and UV resistant, this versatile tape meets UL 510 standards and can be used for automotive, marine, home and recreational repairs.Directions:1. Prepare and clean the surface to be wrapped.2. Peel back the liner and wrap the necessary amount of tape around the repair surface stretching the tape and overlapping by half the width.3. One the surface is wrapped, overlap the last wrap fully to ensure a good seal.""Living in the desert where blown automobile hoses are not uncommon in summer, I want a roll of this in each of my family's cars for unexpected emergencies! I am putting a roll near the medicine cabinets and in every toolbox.  I recommend this product.I was given a sample to test and evaluate; I do my best to provide a review that is fair, honest and thorough. I hope this is helpful."
80253,"Director Randy Moore filmed Escape from Tomorrow entirely at the Disney World and Disneyland theme parks. As he did not have permission to do so, he used meticulously planned guerrilla tactics in order to shoot the film without being caught. The actors kept the script on their iPhones. The crew used handheld cameras and dressed as park visitors. Scenes were blocked and rehearsed several times in hotel rooms before shooting, and dialogue was recorded using digital devices which were taped to the actors. The film was also shot in monochrome, in order to avoid lighting issues. No one ever suspected the cast or crew of foul play. In this respect, Escape from Tomorrow is an incredibly risky one of a kind achievement. Randy Moore was afraid that Disney would find out about his little experiment, and so he edited the film in South Korea. The film was released at Sundance, and word of mouth spread quickly.Ultimately, the unorthodox history behind the making of the film would prove to be far interesting than the film itself.Escape from Tomorrow tells the story of Jim White, who finds out that he has lost his job on the last day of his family vacation at Disney World. He decides to keep it to himself, so that his wife, his son, and daughter can have a fun time without all of the drama. As he and his family ride the monorail to the park, Jim catches sight of two young Parisian girls &#8211; two little Lolita&#8217;s that he will soon become obsessed with. Make no mistake, Jim is a disturbed man. While riding the &#8220;Small World&#8221; attraction, Jim begins to hallucinate. The cherub-faced animatronics begin to grow fangs, smiling evilly at Jim as he passes by. Later, Jim catches sight of the Parisian girls once again, and follows them to Space Mountain, where he forces his son to ride. After the kid gets motion sickness, Jim&#8217;s wife chastises him, and she takes the boy back to the hotel to recover. Jim takes his daughter to the Magic Kingdom, where the son of a creepy wheel-chair bound man pushes her to the ground, scraping her knee. Jim takes her to the nurse, who seems to be a bit disturbed and warns Jim of a mysterious &#8220;cat flu&#8221; that is going around the park. &#8220;You can be a host and not even know it,&#8221; she says.For the rest of the day, Jim will continue to follow the Parisian girls, he will fall under the spell of an ex-Disney princess who is now an evil queen, and he will learn that the majority of the ever-smiling Disney Princesses at the park are actually expensive hookers who sell themselves to rich Japanese businessmen, while also becoming the target of an evil plot at Epcot&#8217;s Spaceship Earth which will purge him of his vivid imagination. Hallucinatory images are sprinkled throughout to give the film a surreal Lynchian feel, but these moments are fleeting &#8211; which is upsetting, because these are perhaps the most involving sequences in the film, as the bulk of the running time is dedicated to Jim&#8217;s tireless pursuit of those darned Parisian girls. These scenes are repetitive and dull &#8211; and honestly, Jim is a poorly written character. After a while, I was ready to get away from him.And then there&#8217;s the &#8220;cat flu&#8221; sequence, which brought back memories of a certain toilet scene from Dumb and Dumber. After a few more slightly trippy scenes, the film ends in a bizarre fashion that doesn&#8217;t quite work, not even in the realm of avant-garde cinema. The trailer for Escape from Tomorrow would have you believe that this is one of the greatest films ever made, a psychedelic wonder the likes of which you have never seen before. At the end of the day, all that it really offers is weak social commentary on the inherent creepiness behind family theme parks, featuring the shenanigans of a Lester Burnham wannabe. The one saving grace in Escape from Tomorrow comes in the form of Abel Korzeniowski&#8217;s beautiful score.I wanted to love this film. I really did. While there are some clever moments here, they never really add up to much. I wanted this film to take me to new heights, to restore my faith in the medium. It didn&#8217;t do any of those things. In fact, it&#8217;s all painfully, unforgivably ordinary."
80254,"I put these in my Ibanez EW acoustic-electric as a cosmetic upgrade and the tone and sustain is absolutely amazing, not to mention they look fantastic. They fit like they were made for this bridge but rubbed a bit of pine tar in the holes with a q-tip to make sure they seated fully. Absolutely tickled with the look and performance. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
80255,"At this time, I am using this switch on my Fender Frontman 25R to switch between the normaland drive channels. The 90 deg. jack is perfect for this (and a lot of amps),as there are no dials in this area. I have run into the 90 deg. jack problem, and the onlysolution I have found is to use a Mono to Stereo 1/4 inch gender changer, or a short monoextension cable (which is what I normally use, as the stereo jack presents added problems) as nobody makes a 1/4inch mono female to 1/4inch mono male gender changer, which I have found to be more than a little strange.This is a very old style switch that is made in China (like everything else) but works very wellfor this simple task. I have 4 on hand."
80256,"I've got a couple of rosebushes in the backyard that are absolutely stunning. I've tried propagating from cuttings in the past, following a variety of methods I've found online. I generally have ended up with hardened sticks stuck in the dirt or with rotted branches. This product, however, has actually enabled me some success with propagating. The directions are easy to follow, and there are actual roots growing from the cuttings I took from my rosebushes. Now only time will tell if I can take from here and nurture them into new bushes."
80257,I've read several of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch books and have really enjoyed all of them.  Titus Welliver does an excellent job of playing Bosch and he fits my vision of Bosch very well.  I look forward to more of this series !  Good job Amazon--so far every one of your pilots is something that I would watch.
80258,"I love this show, I love the realistic relationships between the characters. I really, really, really enjoy the stable committed relationships in the show.  It is so nice to see a show where characters are in stable relationships and still are interesting and absorbing."
80259,"On time, condition good, I love this series, good acting, enough different story lines, just sit back and enjoy it."
80260,"Educational, fun, diverse characters.  relatable characters for my kids.  Interesting that most shows don't have an African or African American male character or if they do it is only a supporting character"
80261,"""Turn"" the new AMC drama about George Washington's Culper spy ring is based on the book ""Washington's Spies"" by Alexander Rose. The story revolves around farmer turned spy Abraham Woodhull, ably played by Jamie Bell. He, his wife and friends, Anna Strong, Caleb Brewster and Captain Talmadge match wits with It has some of the most memorable villains that I have ever seen: Major Robert Rogers of the Queen's Rangers; Major John Andre, the British Army's spymaster; the lecherous Capt. John Simcoe, who's intentions are anything but honorable; and the oddly sinister Major Hewlett, Commanding Officer of the British Garrison at Setauket, Long Island. It also is a compelling story of genuine heroism at the time of our nation's birth.Unfortunately, it also has some of the worst research, staging and writing that I have ever witnessed. Scenes are sometimes so ill managed that it has become a part of my enjoyment of the series to laugh at the antics of the characters. We're talking over the top blunders of epic proportions. Examples are plentiful: Early in the pilot the notorious Major Rogers and his Queen's Rangers ambush a group of ""Connecticut Dragoons."" The battle scene is awash with blood, men's bodies strewn `round-about, but there are no horses, not even a dead one. Why is that important? Dragoons were mounted infantry, or heavy cavalry, and they rode into battle! Not having horses cluttering up the scene cuts down on production costs I am sure, so perhaps next time you should just call the ""Dragoons"" infantry, okay? Another monstrous mistake occurs in the third episode when Abraham Woodhall and his father, the owner of 25 fattened hogs, make a contract with a British officer to sell said hogs to the Redcoats for 7 per pound. Just for the sake of argument let us say that each hog weighs 200 pounds, so the total weight of the pork is 5000 pounds (200 x 25 = 5000). Now multiply that times 7 and you get 35,000, right? You realize that means those hogs were worth seven times their weight in silver? I don't want to let the cat out of the bag but the British Pound Sterling was originally backed by a pound of silver (troy weight), sterling silver to be exact. That is why it is called the ""Pound Sterling."" Some one needs to let the writers know that 1 was a lot of money in 1776. To put it in perspective a skilled workman earned about that amount for a week's work.There are so many errors that plague this production, that I could go on for a while yet. But, in sum, ""Turn"" isn't awful, it just lacks attention to detail and a bit of common sense. It's strength lies in the connivances and complexities of Loyalists, Redcoats and Patriots of that time. Kudos also to Jamie Bell and company for some pretty good acting in the face of blockheaded writing.Since it is based on fact perhaps it is a story that would be better told in documentary form?  Anyway, I'll be watching to see if it improves, and to enjoy the heroism of patriots and wickedness of villains."
80262,Episodes are beginning to drag.  The story line is drying up.  I'm afraid the show will start losing focus if it goes for more than one or two more seasons
80263,"I owned an older model of this feeder that lacked the roof, and I was eager to try this version; it seemed like a perfect upgrade.  Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed in it.First of all, one of the welds on the roof where the posts are inserted is crooked.  It was possible to insert the post and use the feeder, but it looks a bit cockeyed.  NOT the quality I expect from the Duncraft name (and price).Next, I discovered how inconvenient it is to fill this feeder, not a small consideration for a feeder that holds so little.  With the roofless version, I could simply turn it over, shake out the hulls, add fresh seed, and shake it until all the seed was under the grid.  That can't be done with this one because of the way the roof is attached.The posts are not fastened to the feeder; the feeder and roof have round holes where the posts just sit.  The roof is only balanced on the posts, not fastened, so if you turn over the feeder, posts go flying.  The washer that holds down the grid is attached to the hanger, which goes through the roof, so the screw and washer can't be removed to lift the grids for filling unless the roof is moved up out of the way.  Bottom line:  The feeder needs to be partially disassembled and reassembled to refill it.  Bare-handed most of the time, as it's a fiddly process to get it all back together.  In the cold and snow.  Every couple days.The quality and filling hassles didn't stop my trying to use it, though.  What ultimately retired this feeder was that ""Squirrel Blocker"" turned out to be merely a naming convention, not a description of the feeder's performance.  The squirrels quickly figured out that launching themselves onto the feeder from a nearby tree would shake the feeder enough to spill seed handily onto the ground.  Soon they observed that this also caused seed to shuffle to one side, piling it high enough to reach into the grid and grab it.  Hot on the heels of that breakthrough was the realization that simply sitting on one edge of the feeder tipped it enough to keep the seed piled up for easy access.This could be avoided by placing the feeder where squirrels can't jump onto it and using a pole baffle so they can't climb up.  If you have such a location, would like to add a platform feeder, and have a setup (e.g., handy picnic table) that makes it easy to work with the feeder when filling it, this feeder might fill the bill for you.  It's attractive and sturdy despite its manufacturing defects, and I think it would last a long time.However, any feeder can be pretty well squirrel-proofed by locating it where squirrels can neither jump nor climb onto it.  If I had such a location, I would surely use it.  Meanwhile, I can only chalk up another victory for the squirrels."
80264,"Very humerous as expected, but a little flat at times.  Dawn French's character was way too over the top as usual.  that's the main reason I couldn't make it through all of the episodes."
80265,This towel works very well and it's just the right size.  Holds lots of water and Easy to wring out
80266,"VB has a well thought out story line which keeps me coming back for more. It is the only animated product that can hold my interest as well keeping my guardian duties easier when my nieces and nephews are here.The voice talents are so well geared to each screen character without being distracting or forced.Amazon's video service is awesome! Apple got to watch out, for I mainly use my iPads (I got alll the versions) on the road and this service seems to be dominating my viewing time."
80267,"One of the best seasons, with compelling story lines and twists that will make you gasp. Not to be missed!!"
80268,"If you want to learn about biblical times, from Abraham to the new yeast ament, then this 3 part documentary is recommended. It's by PBS"
80269,"When this first arrived I was excited. I thought now I can finally plug in multiple devices and have something that is aesthetically pleasing. As others have stated it worked great for the first month and then power level continued to read Low and then it stopped working. I opened it up and the fuse had blown, went to AutoZone and purchased a 5-8 pack of fuses for $4. Unit is now working properly but continues to read low power. I wouldn't purchase again but at least its working for now."
80270,Had to completely redo the brakes on my 99 Ford F150 due to rusted out lines and other components.  Not the best job to work on but I got her done.
80271,I use this to run my yellow light on my ATV when I'm plowing my drive way and need to go into the street. Plugs right into the pig tail on the back of my ATV.
80272,"The writing and story makes it very enjoyable to watch. English TV series are so well written and the actors are seasoned performers, not just cute."
80273,"Bosch Icon wipers are great all year long, in the Winter ice and snow doesn't build up like it can on framed wipers, they flex making even contact across the glass with out pressure points. I've been very pleased with performanceand life these wiper offer. They mount on standard wiper arms with a solid grip and stay on once locked down. I clean the edge with a soft cloth and sometimes use a rubber treatment after months of use, I find this keeps thewipers in tip top shape."
80274,"I thought the presentation was done in an honest but fair way and didn't avoid the impact of the father on his sons, both positive and negative. The acting was well done by all...everyone in it should be proud they were a part of it."
80275,"This so much fun.  Plant and watch it grow.  And, grow it does.  I just wish I could afford a couple of dozen of these.  AeroGarden should just send them to me for the advertisement."
80276,I just loved this series from start to finish. What a great series. I think they probably ended it at the right time too. It had run it's natural course.
80277,"Have always enjoyed the different approach of this team to investigating the paranormal.They look for the cause of the haunting, as well as looking for normal explanations for activity.During their investigations they do come across some good and valid evidence of the paranormal.Finding the item that has retained energy and offering advice to either remove the item or in some way acknowledge the entities.This series has started out very well, the first three episodes have some unusual locations and some great activity."
80278,"I enjoy this show but there are so many things to nit pick. Does anyone else recognize zombies that were killed in previous episodes? Sometimes I'll even see the same one within the same episode that was killed in an earlier scene. It's been over a year since the beginning of this, I think it's time for the zombies to start decaying and falling apart. They are infected with some virus, they aren't magic."
80279,"I have to say I really enjoy this show. I honestly did not expect to, but once I got over the shocker in the first show, I found my self going back for another episode. It is a light comedy with great sarcastic one-liners. Both main characters play well off each other. The teens add little poignant side stories."
80280,I've used this in BMW concertible and my Suzuki SUV and it worked well in both.  I used it to drive Torque software.
80281,"Love this fire pit! Was looking for something large and this was the largest I could find short of custom building a fire pit into the ground (which may come later). Think of this as the equivalent of a portable bonfire - it holds a large amount of wood that can easily burn for several hours. It gives off a good deal of heat but not so much that you can't enjoy sitting around the pit and roasting marshmallows. The copper is beautiful but as others have noted, that changes as soon as you use it for the first time (it is a fire pit after all). I'm actually glad about that since there has been a huge increase in copper thefts in the area where I live so I'm more comfortable with this being used and not screaming &#34;Take me, I'm copper!&#34; My only complaint is that for the price, it should include a poker, as some other pits do. But the pit itself is awesome. Pricier than others but well worth it."
80282,"Guilty entertainment with good acting, twisted plots, weird characters and dark humor.  Watching the interplay between Boyd Crowder and Raylin Givens is great fun."
80283,"I just used this pad to remove oxidation of a very large Rv. I used it with McGuires 3 part RV oxidation compound set for fiberglass. It took a med blemished oxidated gelcoat finish and turned it into a mirror finish smooth, no burns or scratches.Oxidation is totally off finish. Its a great pad. Well worth the cost and it really held up enough to do entire 28 ft rv. Good solid foam no junk. Make sure you clean pad as it builds up. I just hold a hand scrub brush on wheel and let in spin on pad. Pad is strong enough to stand up to some good pressure."
80284,"I live in the country and there are a lot of deer and rabbits out here.  I use the Havahart Deer Off II around the outside of my house to keep these creatures from dining on my lovely wife's plants.  This sprayer is so easy to use and it even came with the needed batteries.  The best thing about this sprayer is I just depress the trigger and it sprays where ever I point the nozzle.  No more pumping my old sprayer.  The container with the repellent is not even heavy to carry around while I spray.  Lightweight is good.  Most importantly, it did not kill my wife's plants or the woodland creatures.  Also, the battery operated sprayer is reusable.  I will purchase the Havahart repellent for my sprayer when I run out, but I think the half gallon will last awhile.  This is a great product."
80285,Love everything about this series. Looking forward to watching the new season. The cast and writing are great. That's all.
80286,"If you have a clear coat scratch, meaning that the clear coat is scratched off and the paint is exposed, then this product is fantastic. It really does work on these types of scratches. If you have a scratch deeper than that, do not bother using this product. Go to the Auto parts store, or the dealer, or on-line and get the exact touch up paint for your vehicle and follow the directions. Good luck - it may never look the same again."
80287,"the only decent and believable characters are the good looking secretive guy and the teenage boy trying to figure out what is going on. the idea is interesting, but i don't think they have executed the show very well. i stopped watching after a few episodes."
80288,Works well as a pop wind screen for our field operations. When the Z108 Party patrol is out and about the never leave without it.
80289,"They aren't afraid to share their views, and hold no punches. It may offend some, but if you want to feel refreshing honesty and see good family values hard at work, this is the show for you. Sure it's scripted and a bit cheesy at times, but I think each character is true to themselves, even during the scripted scenes."
80290,"Thought this might be entertaining and funny but it was just a too realistic view of people solely focused on themselves and the awful, hurtful behavior that goes along with those types of priorities. We found it rather depressing to watch, not at all humorous, more head shaking in disbelief that this was actually a show."
80291,I tried 4 different mirrors and this is the best on our 2012 Honda Pilot. Its got a rubber strap and ratchet mechanism to get a nice firm fit. And the OEM mirror can still be used!
80292,"Each year you hate Patty a little bit more, but each year she proves herself worthy...Ellen continues to hang in there being abused and watching her back.....great show..but start from the first season to get the full effect."
80293,"since i don't have cable, found this by looking at sci-fi in prime videos.  so glad i did.  can't wait for season 3!"
80294,"I shaved off a star but wish it could be a 1/2 star.  I explain why below.  But first I must say this is great performer.  Plenty of capacity in the water/solution tank and plenty of capacity in the dirty water tank.  The width of the cleaning path is great.  The sound volume of the motor is excellent.  It is pretty solid for a mostly plastic machine.  The ability to have an easy to push self contained upright is great, even better with a lift off unit to focus on concentrated spills, furniture and your car.  The hand held nozzle attachment/hose rolls up neatlyWhy I took off a point is as follows: The fresh water tank is a little clumsy and I didn't see a separate measuring area for the solution.  My older Bissell upright (I believe model 25) was better in that department, but it didn't clean as well as this one and the capacities of fresh and dirty water are much less.  The cord, while easy to wind up, seems shorter than my much cheaper upright.Despite my nitpicking, this is an excellent machine and I highly recommend it.  Bissell did a great job with this."
80295,"Unlike Hannah Montana, this show gets better as it went on. This is why I was sad when Nickolodeon decided to cancel it in 2012. The characters of iCarly fit perfectly the way they portrayed them. The fun just kept coming, evening with us who grew up in the 1950&#34;s with Mickey Mouse Club, Captain Kangaroo, & Howdy Doody. I am glad they are out on Amazon & DVD. I hope iCarly does make a comeback....it&#34;s fun to watch!"
80296,"Update:Now that our trap has seen ""action,"" I am updating the review to 5 stars.Each year, I await the Blenheim apricots. A farmer at our local market grows them, and they are highly sought after. I left a few sitting on a little table in our kitchen, to ripen. But the next morning, I saw that several contained divets, of the type made by small creatures chewing on them.First of all, gross. A rodent in my kitchen. Second of all, I moved the trap from the attic to the table, inserting a chunk of apricot (sitting on a small plastic cap), and only hours later, we had our Blenheim napper. My husband cleared the trap, and I re-set. We had barely left the room when we heard it ""activated"" again. No doubt there are more.At the market, I told the farmer about the popularity of his apricots among the rodent population (I always keep fruit on this table, but there's never been sign of rodent activity until the Blenheims arrived). A lady overheard me and said she had the same thing happen in her condo. Apparently, the scent of the apricots (which, honestly, aren't that aromatic, compared to other fruits) lured some mice up through the pipes into her unit.Some people might balk that the old-fashioned traps are much cheaper. Yes, that's true. But do you want a mouse going ""splat"" on your kitchen table? I don't. We also tend to throw out the trap, not wanting to get into the details of extrication.This trap is great. Well worth the money. Effective, clean, and convenient.---I've given this trap only 4 stars for now. The reason is that we're not sure it's in the right place or if our mouse problem is already resolved. I will revisit in a few weeks as news develops.For now, I can say that this is vast improvement over the previous method: climbing the ladder through the closet into the attic and setting an old-fashioned trap.  (My husband actually gave me a headlight, as worn by splunkers, to assist in this process. He is too big to negotiate this tight spot in the closet, so I am the designated ""mouser."")I had to visit YouTube to find a non-finger-damaging way to set the trap (you use a fork!). And even though the method works fine, it's a giant hassle. Especially when precariously perched. Then you have to dispose of the entire trap (unless you are less squeamish than I am). Try this a few times, and the cost adds up. Not to mention, it's still gross, maneuvering the thing into a bag for disposal.With this Rat Zapper trap, you simply add batteries and peanut butter, set it in the desired spot, and wait. When it ""zaps,"" you need only slide the occupant out into a waiting bag.We haven't spied an ""occupant"" yet, but it could be because our past weeks of effort took their toll. I will update when/if that happens."
80297,Anything Timothy Hutton appears in is certain to be interesting and worth seeing more than once.  He's one of the finest actors in film and on TV and has deserved far more Oscars and Emmys than he has received.  I'm waiting for the next DVD I can order that features his work.
80298,"Set in the year 2707, a sci-fi action film ""Mutant Chronicles"" revolves around a group of soldiers on a mission to stop and destroy the ""Machine"" deep under the ground, that turn humans (dead or alive) into hostile ""mutants."" Though the storyline sounds very familiar (""Resident Evil,"" for instance), it has got potential. It could be a very enjoyable film with well-made actions, which ""Mutant Chronicles"" sadly lacks.""Mutant Chronicles"" offers lots of battle scenes, some of which are violent and gory. As to the gore and violence of ""Mutant Chronicles,"" I have little to no problem with them simply because they are not very impressive here. Murky photography, badly-staged actions and bland choreography only make the viewers feel ""What is happening?"" And you have to sit through the convoluted, sometimes implausible story. I like the designs of weapons and machines, but the obvious use of special effects is very disappointing.The cast is interesting: Thomas Jane, Ron Perlman, Devon Aoki, Sean Pertwee, Benno F&uuml;rmann and Anna Walton, who was Princess Nuala in ""Hellboy II."" John Malkovich briefly shows up as a religious leader, but he has little to do in the story.""Mutant Chronicles"" is based on the game franchise. Well, that's what they say. I don't know anything about the source material, but I judge from what I read on the net (including some commentaries from the angry reviewers) that the film's story is not very faithful to the game universe. Perhaps a faithful adaptation needs a budget of ""Lord of the Ring."" What we have is the filmed version that is neither terrible nor particularly amazing."
80299,"I'm used to conventional steel finger picks. These actually work really well as long as you don't play hard, like I sometimes do with my other picks. Playing hard really hurts my exposed finger pads that are ordinarily covered by regular picks. However, these allow for better touch and expression when playing softly."
80300,"Have you ever had a lug that just doesn't want to let go of thread?! It sucks.... You either use a cheater bar, or you get heavy duty long breaker bar! I've been using cheater bars as long as i remember, but i scratched my black chrome, laser etched rachet the last thing i did it, so i decided its time to get a breaker bar. haha And i have never felt in this much control! I do alot of shock and wheel work, and its just one of those things that are necessary. Plus, gorilla stuff are top notch. Just absolutely great stuff."
80301,"Havent had the need for it just yet,but took it out of the package to look at.I really dont think this will fit my needs in preventing ice & snow on the winshield.Not flexible enough to lay flat against the winshield.Might work ok as a sun shade inside though."
80302,Could not follow such a stupid theme.  Doubt it will get much further than this pilot.  Not funny at all.
80303,"This looks like a good, high quality hitch.  I have installed it but have not used it for any towing so I cannot comment on it's actual performance."
80304,"I love summer!! I love the warm weather, having cook-outs and friends over for beer and crabs on my deck, and I even enjoy opening the shed up and getting out the lawn and garden equipment. The only thing I don't like about the warm weather are the stinging insects that seem to prefer taking up residence in my shed, under the decking and along the gutters.I always pick up a can of Black Flag Wasp spray at the beginning of every season because nothing ruins a nice summer day than having a bunch of angry hornets buzzing your patio or deck. This spray allows you to saturate and destroy nests from a safe distance as well, so there's no need to get out the ladder and risk getting stung when clearing out these pests. Simply saturate the nest, give the Black Flag time to work, and come back and knock the now dead nest down with a broom. Quick, easy and safe!"
80305,"Applied as directed this definitely got rid of unwanted foam in our spa. Unfortunately, it also left a nasty residue which we are now trying to get rid of without any improvement so far. Personally, I'd be happy to be just dealing with the foam.It looks like our next step will be to empty the spa unless we can find a product at the pool store to remedy this problem.I can't recommend this product. By the way, this is the first Orb-3 product that I have used that has given me a problem."
80306,"I found these for like five bucks at Marshall's the day after I ordered these!  Anyhow, they are a nice set of scissors and have a heavy duty feel to them.  I like how you can easily take the scissors apart for cleaning, or using the blade as a knife.  It's a really handy pair of scissors, as it has all these other functions built-in, like a bottle opener.  I have a pair of Tradesman scissors which are even more heavy-duty, but this is a good pair to keep around to use in the kitchen, or even the garden."
80307,I ordered this pedal for my casio keyboard and it works great. It has a realistic feel to a piano and appears to be made of quality matterial. this pedal works great and make my keyboard sound great
80308,"well i love this, i intend to use it as a scavenging inverter in my Bug Out Bag incase of a SHTF situation.it is a little heavy but i have tried it out, i can charge cell phones, run computers, even keep a fridge on for a little while with this bad boy, for the price it is a great inverter."
80309,"I have been a user of Ringer Lawn Restore fertilizer for years.  I wanted to try the phosphate free formula.  I used it on Bermuda and fescue sod. The product has no smell, dissolves easily and doesn't burn the grass.  It's safe around people and pets. Applied it in the spring in the South and the lawn has already greened up. If you are concerned with phosphates then try the Ringer 0% Phosphate Lawn Restore."
80310,"Sad attempt at humor. Poor acting to boot. Why is this a popular series? There is sooo much TV that is good, why does this get good ratings??!!"
80311,"I was impressed with the quality of this tool.  It has a tough, smooth coating on it that makes it easy to clean.  Time will tell if the coating will stand up to heavy use without chipping off but I'll post a follow up review at the end of the season.  So far, I'm impressed.  I also like that it has a long, hardwood handle.  Most gardening tools made today seem very cheap but this looks to be a quality tool."
80312,"I own aTaylor Guitars 355-CE Jumbo 12 String Acoustic Electric Guitarand it came with these strings on it. 12 string guitars are generally hard to play for long periods of time, so they might not get as much use as a regular 6 string. The tone from these strings is just as bright and clear 8 months later, and they still hold their tuning like they after the first 2 days. Elixir strings are in general more expensive than other major brands - but the extra few bucks are worth it because the sounds stays so clear and consistent after extensive use. They are great strings on any guitar."
80313,It is a big drying cloth that really does a great job soaking up water. Much better than the AmorAll 'rag' I bought at a B&M; store. That piece of junk started unraveling the first time I washed it. The Cobra cloth still looks brand new after being washed 3 or 4 times.Well worth the money for the quality.Darin
80314,The mysteries are well presented with twists and unexpected turns.  Enjoy watching as the mysteries unwind.  Worth a look and if you like mysteries you will like Heat of the Sun.
80315,I needed a tire gauge for my new car and Amazon had this on one of their holiday deals.I have been very happy with it so far.  You can program in your tire's required pressure and it will remember it and let you know how far away you are.  I've tested it with some lab manometers and it is within 1psi (which is rare) so I can't complain about that.It lights up when you use it so even if its night you'll have no trouble reading it.Have already bought an additional gauge for my wife's car.Recommended
80316,"this movie is a 4 person show, Lue McWilliams is Lilly, the cancer stricken dying mom, who she herself knows she was a terrible mom. Ryan Vigilant is her gay son, who never has a relationship that lasts. Benjamin Weaver is Ted, Lilly's live in groundskeeper/cook. he has secrets. The reason for the loss of a star is the 4th character, the daughter Laura, played by carmine Aliers. Why does the older sister always have to be in conflict with everyone. She is shrill and annoying and loud. You know she will be redeemed at the end but at various times you think she is coming around and then the harpy strikes again, I'm bored with this type. The other 3 actors are superb. The story really is about &#34;can't we all just get along&#34;. It was a good film don't get me wrong. Not for those afraid of man to man contact."
80317,This is not normally in my wheelhouse. I didn't watch Lost or Revolution. I did watch X-Files. Chris Carter knows how to hook me in.Order the series already!
80318,Season Two MUCH better than Season One.  For those watching 1st season; be patient - better CONTINUING plots in the 2nd.
80319,"Having access to the episodes of this series is like having a technical library of manufacturing.  It not only satisfies ones curiosity about things about how things are made, it is a resource that can serve as an inspiration for invention and problem solving.  The videos are also an excellent teaching resource.  However you use these videos, you'll find that the accuracy and quality of the portrayal is excellent."
80320,"While this is a good looking trap, I can't say that it did much. I had it set up for a couple of weeks in my mother-in-laws house because she said she saw a mouse in her house. Well, I put three snap traps down, and the second night one snapped,and the following night another snapped. All were baited with peanut butter (the same brand). I can say that this is much safer than the snap traps, having almost snapped my fingers more than once. Other than that, there isn't much to say. I think it is an expensive product that does not do what it is supposed to do, at least for me. Out of all the traps I have used, the snap traps have been great.I also have an electric trap that is amazing, but it was VERY expensive becuase it will kill a large rat! So far, for me, nothing beats a snap trap....just watch your fingers. Of course, I do not have pets, and I don't put them where my kids can get at them. If this would have caught ANYTHING, I might have given it a better rating, but as it stands, I cannot. I will keep it baited (with fresh peanut better) and I will report back if things change, but I'm not holding my breath."
80321,Good show with no unnecessary sex.  Wish it was still going!!!  Funny characters and varied story lines with interest. Miss
80322,"I love law and order Los Angeles though my first, always and number 1 love is the original Law and Order. Same concept different players and some big name players I might add. As we all know law and Order always took from the headlines and made their twist to it, well it's no Different in LA where at times it gives story lines from the entertainment world. I do like the show, I feel it could be a bit stronger after watching some of the episodes I have yet to know each character. And I know they are probably now and then going to switch people sometimes I like and get use to a character and then they bring in someone new for you to get use to. But I would keep watching.MAN I miss Jerry Orbach. He was real, you could relate and he had his humor that flowed right into the Law and Order shows, that made you love watching him and law and order. R.I.P. There are also a lot of good actors who were apart of this franchise."
80323,"The cast is stellar and the acting is superb.  There are original songs, dance numbers and plots and sub plots that keep you coming back for more.  Bravo!"
80324,Great dialogue...Great acting...captivating pace.I loved every minute of watching each episode to see the light side and the dark side of the law.
80325,"... it's a very generic-sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp.  The same is true of many of the pedals from this era, including the (gasp!) Tube Screamer.  The Tube Screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp, but not too many people will tell you that it's a great stand-alone distortion because it's not.  Same goes for the Boss DS-1.  Now, here's where things get interesting:  There are PLENTY of modifications that can be done to this pedal by Keely, Monte Allums, and others, that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast, dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks.  For the cost of this pedal, and the $30 or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod, are well worth it.  Mine is modified with the Monte Allums Tri-Gain Rectifier modification and it's absolutely killer.  I use it as a lead boost, but by itself it's a nice overdriven tone that you'll find plenty of use for.  If you want a basic, solid, well-built distortion pedal, this is it - but by itself the Boss DS-1 is really nothing special.  But as a platform for great-sounding mods, you can't go wrong."
80326,"I'm really enjoying this glimpse into the Kilcher family's 600+ acre homestead and their self sufficient lifestyle in the Alaskan wilderness. Very interesting how they originally came to be there. Eighty years ago the first Kilcher fled war-torn Europe with his wife to establish an independent life in America, and their descendants are carrying on that tradition. Farming in Virginia is tough enough for our family, but nothing compared to the Kilcher's daily struggle to survive. I'm cheering them on, especially through those interminable winters. I'm as far north as I care to be in the Shenandoah Valley."
80327,"Great show.  Suspense, thriller and of course Horror.  Not a family show.  Its an FBI agent dealing with a serial killer and his clan.  Very gory at times.  Murder is involved greatly with these insane characters.  Story is very good and pulls the watcher into the show.  Definitely forget their own life a while.  Creepy episodes with the hero trying to outsmart the villain."
80328,"There isn't a whole lot to say about this, it's a hummingbird feeder. The feeding ports and perches all come in separate bags and you just snap them on. There aren't any instructions or anything but it's easy enough to figure out if you just look at the picture on the box to see what it should look like. The only real downside to this feeder is that it is so big that it's really impractical unless you've got tons of hummingbirds in your yard. When you consider that nectar is supposed to be switched out at least once a week if not more often, 48 ounces is an enormous amount to keep switching out. I would suggest going for something smaller unless you really think you're going to make it through this much nectar before it spoils."
80329,"Besides Walking Dead, Revolution is by far, my favorite. If you enjoy Sy-Fi, I'm sure this will also become your favorite. I just read in a few of the reviews, that Revolution has been cancelled!! That was like a knife too my heart, and along with other reviewers, where does NBC gather their data, to warrant the cancellation. Let's just hope someone else, with brains, if possible, continues to produce Revolution for us. Currently Grieving for our soon, loss too be."
80330,I have purchased Seasons 1 and 2. I am impressed with all the characters in this TV show! I will be a life long fan of this series! I will purchase every episode for Season 3.
80331,Good show and we hope they continue with many more seasons-we thought it was going to end after this one but we plan to order the next season we just enjoyed watching.
80332,"Charging for a trailer clip is weak sauce. Fix it before you alienate more Who fans! I am so glad I read the reviews first and noticed that ""Prequel"" really meant ""clip,"" or I would be very angry right now."
80333,"The Boss AC-3 is a serviceable acoustic simulator. I am the only guitarist and in my playing environment (children's church) and frequently need to switch back and forth between acoustic and electric. The AC3 does that job. Although it has several modes, the Jumbo mode seems to be most useful. Played through a carefully EQ'd amp, you can get a tone comparable to a plugged in acoustic electric with very bright settings. There is an audible hiss, less noticeable plugged direct into PA, noticeable plugged into a good, clean tube amp, out of control with humbuckers or solid states.The key to using this pedal is using it correctly.First and foremost: use single coils. Tested with a Les Paul with Burstbucker Pro's, the hiss was overwhelming. Played with an American Deluxe Strat with N3 Noiseless pups in the 3rd position, it actually performed very well on a crystal clean channel.Point two - any form of gain will create a ton of hiss.Point three - tube amps perform infinitely better than solid state amps (tested through a Frontman 212 and Vox Pathfinder vs an Orange Tiny Terror and Fender HRD).The AC3 is not a set it and forget it pedal. Based on the volume of the amp and the room you're in, you will need to tweek the EQ to find that tone. I've read that you can use an EQ pedal to get the same tones, I haven't found that to be the case. If your use for this pedal is to cover acoustic parts in a pinch, or in my case as the only guitar player, to switch from acoustic to electric parts quickly, this is a great fit.-2 stars for ever present  hiss, +3 for actually sounding like an acoustic when it's EQ'd correctly."
80334,I am so glad to be able to watch my show on Amazon.com.  Thanks to DISH I can no longer watch AMC so I had thought I would miss this season.  I set up the auto purchase of the video on Amazon and am able to watch on my Laptop and it is great.
80335,I love love love this company. I'm a new customer and just tried this for the first time. It works like magic easy to get off and help me keep that awesome shine on my car in between washes. I've purchased other stuff and it works great as well.
80336,"This brass nozzle is Made in the USA out of solid brass. There are only 3 items that may require replacing in a few years: 2 O-rings and the gasket for the hose attachment. These are easily found, and I expect to replace the O-rings with MIL-SPEC Viton O-Rings if the originals ever wear out. One can procure a small bag for a few dollars, which would last almost a lifetime.The hose easily/gently twists open with a light fan-cone spray pattern, and as I turn it more and more, it progresses towards a powerful stream of water. It still relies on your existing water pressure, so don't expect any type of massive venturi action to magnify the pressure of the water. I find that it is plenty strong for washing cars, and the nozzle patterns are adequate for use with a garden hose. The water stream is powerful enough to blast off residue and road debris stuck onto a car. Turning the water on or off is the easiest thing, simply turn the nozzle tip clockwise or anticlockwise, it is smooth thanks to the O-rings.The nozzle is made out of brass, so try to avoid dinging it on the ground. The one thing that does concern me is that there is a warning on the box that indicates the brass contains lead, which seems to be the norm for brass.Overall: 5/5 stars, one of the best nozzles I've ever used to wash cars. it is extremely easy to use, and built like a tank with only 1 moving part (the adjuster portion) and 3 wear items (2 o-rings and the gasket) that are easily replaceable. It is also made in the USA."
80337,"... but... they're the cheesiest looking leather I've ever seen... real leather for sure, but somehow the maker found real leather that looks like cheap vinyl imitation leather."
80338,"This story had more twists and turns (I loved them all)  and they almost went to far, but we never fell off the ledge.  I can hardly wait to see what is going to happen next.  Super entertaining, you will get caught up in some of the moments, and you will become attached to many of the characters, not just the leads."
80339,"There's quite a bit going on in ""The Red Road.""  In fact, a lot has already transpired backstory-wise before the first episode.Jason Momoa's character, Philip, is an ex-con with mixed racial origins (Lenape, white, maybe African-American) who has recently been released from prison.  He returns to his hometown of Walpole, NJ, which, despite being 25 miles outside of NYC, is quite woodsy and rustic.  We then meet his mother, who apparently does not relish seeing him and, at that point, we are also introduced to her younger son, who might be adopted and thus not related at all to Philip.Then there's a local police officer, Harold, played by Martin Henderson, who--we learn--was in high school with Philip as well as with Harold's recovering alcoholic wife, who also might be a little on the crazy side.  Harold and his wife have two daughters, one of whom is running around with the younger Lenape ""brother"" that Philip's mother just introduced to Philip.  And, it turns out, (minor spoiler) that Philip watched Harold's wife's brother drown in high school without lifting a finger to save him and Philip supposedly, I think, went to juvenile hall for it.Furthermore, there is a missing white teenager that one of Philip's Lenape associates killed and sunk into a nearby lake.  Harold and the local police are sweeping the area in search of the boy who, turns out, had some issues with Philip's white father, played by Tom Sizemore, who operates some criminal business involving, at the least, drugs.This is all a fairly convoluted web of a story and that's just what happens in the first episode . . . and I haven't even told you what happens at the end.I'm two episodes in and liking what I see."
80340,"Chicago Code was answer to the stagnant Reality TV trash that has been shoved down everyones throat these past few years. Chicago Code had outstanding writing, each episode was entertaining, exciting and a show that you looked forward to each week. The cast was outstanding, honestly; I was not sure how Jennifer was going to be playing the Super"
80341,Brush does a great job of loosening up dirt. It seemed like it was maybe just a tad bit too stiff and abrasive though. Small pieces of carpet were coming up with it. I still wouldn't say I dislike the brush over this... I'll just be more careful of where I use it and how hard I scrub.What I was TRYING to do was get out some salt stains left by the winter. Didn't work with just this and carpet cleaner. I'm going to need to pick up some white vinegar apparently.
80342,"I have used other deer repellent products and found most to be messy to apply and the most effective one I have ever used leaves a whitish coating on the leaves of the flowers, detracting from their appearance. This one is clear and the battery operated sprayer made application a breeze! So far it seems to be working but because my deer graze in different areas every day/night I can't be sure until I actually see them reacting to this product. That could be quite some time before I can testify to their reaction to it but when and if it happens I will add to this review."
80343,"I have one already and they work great to chase those pesky critters away from trees that have fruit! they work super and seem to be the only thing that works, powders and sents don't seem the work!"
80344,"I like this show. It is one of my favorite genres. Mystery, covert ops, intrigue, often these adjectives are followed by heavy subjects and graphic violence. Which I enjoy also. However, this series is all that but lighter, and not too many faux pas that wouldmake you say - this could not happen. I enjoy watching this series."
80345,"This additive appears to work for a small above ground pool (an Endless Pool). I say appears because we generally keep the pool clean by rising off before getting in and covering it after use even though it is in an enclosed area.Recently, it seemed to be a little cloudy. I checked the chemical levels and everything looked OK, so I decided to leave it alone. As a pond owner, I know that it is better to make gradual changes and just leave well enough alone. When I saw this product being offered, I thought it sounded interesting and might help.I have been using this a few weeks and noticed the water is looking crystal clear again. There was a small amount of detritus that appeared to be released by the Orb-3 spa enzymes, so I was pleased that the pool is as clean as I had hoped and that the spa enzymes appear to work. I like the 2 ounce marks on the label. This makes it very simple to dose the correct amount.I like this product and was looking to buy more. While looking around, I noticed the Orb-3 Pool Enzymes. This looks like a similar product but at one quarter the dosage (one ounce per 2000 gallons). Since I am using this for a pool at lower temperatures (80-86F), I bought that version."
80346,"Very entertaining,a good pace between skits, great variety of characters and circumstances and many running gags.  All this plus excellent production quality."
80347,Well for the time being they were very bright and would buy again which I will be since mine were stolen.
80348,I previously owned the cable luber that only  has 1 thumb screw.  Could never get that one to work.  I thought this one would do the trick.  I could not get this one to work as well.
80349,"Hummzingers are the best feeders.  It's easy to clean, and attracts lots of hummingbirds.  I have another smaller hummzinger feeder, and am happy with that one as well."
80350,"This capo is lightweight and really tough, it is stiff and takes some strength to open but it stays in place and doesn't damage the necks of my guitars. I've used this on acoustic, electric, 7 string, 12 string, and a lot of 6 string guitars and it always works perfectly. I think it's a really nice tool and it does the job flawlessly."
80351,"I had a lot of questions and concerns when I ordered this. Well, it arrived today, I've been playing it for the past few hours, and here's the answers to those questions:1. Is it worth the money?Absolutely yes. This is an amazing bargain. There are better guitars out there, but not for $170. This really is a great deal.2. How does it sound?Fantastic. It's definitely ""bright"", which a few of the other reviews pointed out, but it also has new strings on it, so it might be a little too early to judge. That said, it's got a nice full sound and if you play up closer to the neck you get more bass in the mix.3. How's the action?Just right. Low enough that it's easy to play (for a 12 string) but no buzzing strings.4. How about the neck?Wider than a 6 string, but not much. Probably a centimeter or so wider. I have small hands and had no problem playing it. The main thing is the added pressure it takes to push down twice as many strings as normal.5. How does it play?Great.6. How does it look?Great. Nice natural finish, all shiny and new. What's not to love? (Note: the picture shows a more whitish finish, but it's a normal natural finish like you'd see on most acoustic guitars. Natural wood color.So if any of you guitarists have been thinking of buying an acoustic 12 string, take a look at this one for sure. I wish I'd bought it long ago. There are just some songs that need to be played on a 12 string."
80352,I was shocked how expensive these parts are when pricing OEM GM parts! I found these on Amazon.com and thought &#34;Hey! Why not try them at this price?&#34; Glad I did. It took less than 20 minutes to install them. The mechanism works nice and smooth. I couldn't be more pleased.
80353,Teachers do the most interesting things these days and teaching doesn't seem to be one of them.  Breaking Bad is an about a Chemistry Teacher who learns he has lung cancer.  He wavers on treatment but doesn't waiver on learning a new line of work to help his family after he is gone.  It's called drug dealing and he makes crystal meth.  He even enlists a former student and high school dropout to help him in his new endeavor.  The show is absorbing and very interesting.  It is low key and not showy but doesn't hesitate to see humor in the man's predicament.  His wife is pregnant with their second child.  Their first child has cerebral palsy.  His sister in law is a shop lifter married to a fervent DEA agent.  The dropout he ignored in school now becomes his favorite pupil.  So much for role models.  Good show with a lot going for it.
80354,Left me wanting to see the next episode just to see what would happen. It was a great show and the actors seemed to have it together.
80355,"Kudos to the director/producer/cast and to the viewers who dial into this gritty/graphic production which keeps me on the edge of my seat with the intense acting, wow."
80356,"This documentary presents the case for how most of us are little more than pawns of the system that controls us.  We are conditioned from birth to accept our place.  The challenge of human existence in the modern world system is to break free of our conditioning and be our true selves.  Although much of the documentary is talking heads, the film makers kept my attention and provoked active thought throughout the film.  For those who are open to challenging their most basic preconceptions, this is a very worthwhile 90 minutes."
80357,"These wipers require replacing the entire wiper component, not just the plastic part. So the first difficulty I ran into was figuring out how to get the original ones off, as this isn't even in my car manual. Had to google it to find out how to do it. Then to put the blades on, you have to figure out which adapter to use and how to snap it into place. The directions for this are ridiculously small and impossible to decipher, so it's pretty much a trial and error thing. Once I got it snapped on, I was able to put the blade on, and it seemed to work reasonably well enough for a couple weeks. That was, until I was driving in a slight drizzle, turned on my wipers, and I guess the window had some dry spots that caused the blade to stick a little bit and the connector just snapped off, sending the entire blade flying through the air. Thankfully it didn't hit anyone, or another car, or I could have had some real damages to pay. Luckily I saved the original wipers which went back on the car ASAP. These went into the garbage. I will note that my wipers use the J-style connector, and another reviewer mentioned a similar issue with their car and the same style connector, so it may be a particular issue with this one. However, I am just not sure I would trust these wipers and these connectors that aren't permanently attached to the wiper and prone to just snapping apart."
80358,Tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice.  This device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy.  Why you would almost think I know what I am doing.
80359,"This is just like any other wax as far as protection, and glossier than most. But, it sprays. It is extremely easy to use and looks great."
80360,"...and then just sort of wound down into predictability. From the previous reviews, I expected more. Story of my life."
80361,"These headlight bulbs are better than stock, but they are marginally better. Cost/benefit analysis shows that one can find better bulbs, albeit more costly."
80362,"Ok, this is great for many reasons as most review will tell you and I have had no problems.  Cons: Minor one would be, that when mounted, the face of the tuner doesn't exactly face your eyes, you have to move your guitar a bit to aim it towards you. But the biggest CON is.... it's pretty much worthless at  a bright daylight gig. In sunlight, its TOO dim! ha ha!  At home or at a night gig its fine. Daylight? Forget it."
80363,"It is nice that it meters out 1oz of product per pump, this makes it easy to use soaps and such that have a fairly specific dilution ratio. Chemical Guys products usually specify 1-2oz of soap per 4-5 gallons of water. Obviously nobody is going to carefully measure their dilution ratios so they can wash their car.1 or 2 pumps, whatever makes me feel froggy that day. Citrus Wash & Gloss or Mr. Pink, either/or - doesn't matter.My only complaints on these pumps are that if you tilt the gallon jug over, product will leak. Also when you are done pumping, a little more will dribble out. The way to combat this is to tilt the container over to drain the top portion of the pump, and voila - no more drips. Either way, you'll be best to hit the end with a rag and probably not let it drip down on expensive stuff. Like your buffer/polisher.Unfortunately, trying to find gallon pumps anywhere is like a needle in a haystack and the options are limited here. Small variety and this is probably the only worthwhile pump on Amazon. At over $8 a piece they are also kind of expensive.But hey - would you rather fight a funnel and a heavy jug when you want some chemical?So a cool thing about these is that they screw down into place. Unfortunately, when you screw the pump down and lock it, it's also the very same as hitting the pump one time. So make sure you have that rag ready... but it's nice because my garage shelving is *JUST* a tad too short to accommodate the Chemical Guys gallon containers and this pump extended. Such is life, tho... Just have to fight locking them into place and losing that ~.5oz of product every time."
80364,"Every summer I plant a tomato garden. I generally only water and occarionally fertilize it, letting the weeds grow up around the tomato plant. This year will be different. Thanks to the KR Tools Pro Series Weeding Hoe my tomatoes will no longer have to fight with the weeds for nutrients. This hardy little tool has plenty of heft and it is just the right size to maneuver around the tomato plants. A long-handled hoe tends to knock the plants around and make the flowers and baby tomatoes fall to their deaths. With this little hoe I can get around them without touching the base of the plants. A perfect hoe for my small-time summer gardening needs."
80365,This whole series is a favorite of mine. I love it and watch episodes over and over - and I wish the anniversary episodes would be shown on Prime.
80366,"this is when you know tv is great! SOA awsome awsome it brings you in, like your there makes you hold your breath wanting more great show. So far one of my all time favorites. could not get better men or woman for this.bobby nice butt:)sorry call em like i see em.its a girl thing:) oh yea GO KATY GO!she will never more be peg bundy.HAPPY THANKSGIVING all please, please, tell me there's going to be a season 6 and hopefuly a number 7 so able can take over for jax :>)just thinking ahead. Omg that would be a mad awesome show."
80367,I thought the pilot episode was very good and I'm curious to see how it's going to go. More episodes please?
80368,The show just isn't as good as it was. Now a rather weak story that seems to putter along to its drawn out conclusion. A bit like the Walking Dead (TV) in that very little seems to happen in an episode these days. And Mosby is SOOOO whiny. Such a kill joy. Don't know how he has ANY friends. Let alone finds someone who would want to marry that.
80369,"What a load of crap. I just installed it in my 2000 civic and I did not see any REAL noticeable benefit.After all the hype about increased mileage, increased fuel economy, quicker starts, etc, etc. I have yetto clearly perceive any real benefits from using it. I paid a arm and leg for it and cannot realize itsbenefits. For civic owners you can continue using the regular NGK plugs, just change them every 8 monthsand you are good to go. I will not waste any more money on snake-oil plugs like this. I will revert to usingthe regular plugs after I have exhausted using the iridiums (since I already bought them, might as well use them)."
80370,"Sorry, folks, but I couldn&#8217;t tell you anything off the top of my head about the 1980 original of MANIAC.  In fact, I&#8217;m not entirely certain that I&#8217;ve seen it.  I suspect &#8211; based on what I&#8217;ve read &#8211; if I had I&#8217;d remember it, but let me also confess that my mind isn&#8217;t as fertile as it once was.  In any event, if you&#8217;re looking for some intellectual comparison between &#8216;then&#8217; and &#8216;now,&#8217; I&#8217;ll not be able to provide it.  What I can tell you is that coming into MANIC (2012) with very little foreknowledge of what to expect probably helped my critical take on the film; had I known in any way what I&#8217;ll discuss below, I can tell you I most likely might&#8217;ve taken away a slightly different impression than I did.In other words, knowing as little as possible about this one might increase the entertainment factor; I stand by that especially when it comes to knowing what I know now about the film&#8217;s unique narrative viewpoint.  So, seriously, if you don&#8217;t want to be spoiled about cinema techniques, turn away now.  Otherwise, you know the drill.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Frank (played by the perennially fresh-faced Elijah Wood) lives a life restoring antique department store mannequins to their former beauty and glory, but, underneath that innocent exterior, he&#8217;s harboring a dark secret indeed.  In truth, he&#8217;s a cold-blooded killer, one raised by a mother who wasn&#8217;t quite the maternal type but instead exposed him to some of her own curiously ribald obsessions.  As a consequence, Frank&#8217;s grown into a young man troubled by visions he controls through medication.  It&#8217;s when he&#8217;s off his meds that his true nature comes to life, and that&#8217;s when he&#8217;s more alive by robbing the beautiful women he comes into contact with of their lives.It&#8217;d be easy to dismiss MANIAC as just another slasher film.  Heck, one might even make a solid case for the fact that hiring the constantly doe-eyed Wood as a deranged lunatic is little more than stunt casting, hoping that bringing in some talent clearly &#8216;across-type&#8217; might fuel greater interest in one&#8217;s picture.  However, that&#8217;d be a serious disservice to what director Franck Khalfoun and screenwriter Alexandre Aja have accomplished here; this is a deftly constructed flick, one that relies on pulling the audience in through clever camera trickery as almost all of this is captured (artistically) in a first person recording.  You see the tale unfold as it does from the killer&#8217;s eyes &#8211; through whatever prism Frank has in his head, with occasionally even the spoken words of what he&#8217;s thinking as he goes about his day &#8211; and while this certainly isn&#8217;t the first film to use that device it may end up being one of the finer examples of it.I&#8217;ve read that Wood fans were increasingly dissatisfied with the picture because despite his prominent appearance in the advertising and packaging he legitimately gets very little screen time.  What you do see of him is fleeting &#8211; there he is reflected in a mirror over here, and there&#8217;s his face faintly in a glass over there, and whoopsy daisy that TV-mounted video camera captured his awe-struck expression as he considers the blood on his body.  As a consequent, his fans are understandably disappointed; they showed up hoping to see the Woodster turn in a virtuoso performance of one man&#8217;s descent into his self-made nightmare.  That happens, mind you, but not by way of Wood&#8217;s usual stripes; it happens by the narrative.Consider this: this MANIAC is a twisted tale told by the camera and not necessarily by the main actor.  True, Wood&#8217;s costars get vastly more screen time than he does &#8211; even his least significant victims &#8211; but that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re really the threads in this unique tapestry.  Wood is on display when it matters most to the story, and he&#8217;s definitely there to suffer his character&#8217;s grand comeuppance in the closing moments.So if you want a horror story, then this is a good one.  If you think you&#8217;re being treated to the latest Elijah Wood tour de force, then you&#8217;re likely to come away jaded.MANIAC (2012) is produced by La Petite Reine, Studio 37, Canal+, Cine+, and Blue Underground.  DVD distribution is being handled through MPI Media Group on behalf of IFC Midnight.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds impressive consistently with all of the in-camera and post- effects looking exceptional.  For those folks who truly dive into the extras, there&#8217;s a solid handful here that should keep you happy, including an hour-long &#8216;Making Of&#8217; documentary, deleted scenes, a poster gallery, the theatrical trailer, and an impressive commentary track from Elijah Wood, director Franck Khalfoun, and executive producer Alix Taylor.  Well done, folks, very well done.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  As remakes go, MANIAC is impressive but, as horror films go, it likely won&#8217;t please everyone.  I suspect that&#8217;s because this as much a stylish creation as it is a psychological exploration into one man&#8217;s rapidly decreasing spiral into his own, personal Hell.  Methinks most folks flock to horror flicks for the glee of the experience &#8211; the pure delight in being scared silly &#8211; and while MANIAC has some impressive turns in that regard this leans heavily toward a character study.  Plus, I have to wonder if the largely first person perspective turns off as many viewers as it excites.  Think of it as a horror film for the eclectic or even artsy crowd, and you may enjoy this one more than most.  I know I did.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group and IFC Midnight provided me with a DVD copy of MANIAC by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
80371,These bulbs are a nice improvement over the factory bulbs in my 2001 Chevy Silverado pickup.  Installation was easy.  The bright white light looks a lot better than the yellowish lights from the factory which adds a little pizzaz to my pickup.  I subsequently bought some for our 1998 Toyota Avalon and the wife was shocked at how much better she could see at night driving home.  Great bulbs!
80372,"Good pilot.  Lots of potential to be a good sci-fi thriller. The pilot could have been better (it could have been great instead of good) with a bit better writing and acting in the first half.  Some of the characters and scenes are stereotypical.  But it definitely ends super strong -- leaves you wanting to see the next epidode.  It's good, with the potential of addictively really good, Chris Carter stuff."
80373,"I automatically put these on any guitar I own as soon as I buy it, I change strings and toss those white plastic pins.  Makes any guitar look so much classier!  I swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too!  Phenominal value,  tons of bang for the buck  They look SOOOO good on there...  Installed easily in 3 different guitars so far."
80374,"The Walking Dead is a phenomenal zombie TV series. My entire family really enjoys watching this show together. Scary stuff, sometimes funny stuff, lots of surprises, and it never disappoints us."
80375,"I loved Melancholia, so I rented this movie since it was another Lars von Trier film.  I had heard a lot of outrage over this film being pornography, but outside of a scene in the final 5 minutes with Shia LaBeouf (which I would have not even realized but for the fact that due to all the controversy I was looking for a &#34;no no&#34; by American standards), there was no more nudity than what is seen on American cable tv these days.The plot is slow, but intriguing.  I liked Skarsgard's performance in this film and I like Christian Slater's performance as well.  Joe's father's death sequence was impactful and was the first time I've ever seen Slater really act.  Overall, I am torn with this movie. It is neither fantastic nor horrible, it just is."
80376,"What can I say. It is a fine flag and at the right price.Note to buyers though - to attach to  a pole, this flag has two grommets (one at top and bottom) and is intended for a flag pole with pulley and rope. However, with a couple of cable ties, it secures nicely to a flag post.We have this on a pole that is mounted to the house at head height and angled upwards. We take the flag in each night."
80377,"I buy 50 pound bags of dog food and have been using plastic bowls to scoop out the chow into a bucket to carry into the dog pen to fill poochie's dish. After going through several bowls which tend to crack and break, I purchased this aluminum scoop.Hot dog, does it work so much better than a bowl!! It's strong and durable and will last no doubt for many years. I didn't measure how much, but the scoop holds a lot, and I can fill a bucket in no time.What else can I say about a scoop? It's strong, has a nice finish to it, it's easy to use, and holds a lot. In fact it's so nice, I'll probably have to hide it from the Grill King so he doesn't scarf it to use for the charcoal."
80378,"The show sounded thrilling; however, after watching it, the show seems lackluster.  The show is not thrilling and it lacks any suspense. It tries to have an air of mystery about it but it just doesn't come off very interesting.  Perhaps it is the wooden acting by the three main characters or perhaps it is the directing.  It seemed the mystery came second to a high school love triangle.  I just didn't care for the characters, the relationships and the lack of suspense the ""mystery"" portions of the show contained."
80379,"I have a kind of funny story to tell about these chairs. Shortly after my order was placed I got an email saying the chairs had been shipped. Two days later I was sitting at my desk (home office) and I heard this big truck rumbling outside--and they were delivering a giant box to my neighbor. He's a cabinet builder and I just assumed he had ordered another table saw or some other large tool and I watched the truck driver carefully moving this really really big box into his driveway. I thought nothing of it except that the box was *really* big. That night around midnight I went to my front door to see if the snow had begun (I live in Connecticut, we're had a wicked winter) and there was the giant box: in MY driveway! Apparently the driver had put it in the wrong driveway, realized his mistake and moved it to mine. So at midnight I went out in single-digits weather and somehow managed to slide the box up my steps and into my living room alone. (It really wasn't heavy at all, just awkward.) Anyway, as soon as I saw the Amazon label I knew what was in the box.The surprise was that these chairs were shipped fully assembled! I was shocked. I had assumed I'd be sitting around one day with a screwdriver and putting these together myself, but these were completely and beautifully assembled--and they were shipped one nested inside the other. And whoever designed the packaging and whoever packed these chairs deserves a bonus for hard work. These chairs were lovingly and carefully packaged and they slid right out of the bottom of the box with ease. The cats were thrilled at having such a big empty box to play in.The Chairs: As far as the quality of these chairs, they are extremely well crafted and very attractive. The frames (they are double-framed under the seat portion) are extremely strong and they are larger (wider) than a normal lawn chair I think. At least it seems that way. I am not a small person (I'm a little on the wide side, too, lol) and the chairs have plenty of room left over and they are super strong. The woven seat is flexible, it gives a bit when you sit in it (as it should) but the frames are solid as a rock. The backs of the chairs are nicely angled, very comfortable and tall enough to offer good back support.Of course, it's still winter outside here, so the chairs are living in my den for the moment, but I can't wait to put them out in the garden. They're so pretty that I've actually considered using them as indoor/outdoor furniture in my screened porch, but it will be nice to have a solid, very comfortable chair outdoors, so the garden is where they are headed.I've looked at a lot of lawn furniture over the years and these chairs are as well built (or better) as anything I've seen. And I think considering their strength and quality, the price is reasonable.By the way, the cats loved having the giant box for a few days as a castle, but I eventually had to take it away from them."
80380,Fun monster flick with a great ensemble cast and a creature that looks somewhat like the creature in feast.A group of people are trapped in an abandened house in the middle of the woods after being chased or hunted there by The &#34;Animal&#34;.There are people from three different parties trapped and things get heated inside the house as well as outside as the creature stalks his prey.I don't know what's worse the animals inside trying to survive or the one they are trying to avoid.There are some pretty brutal scenes of bloody violence but not a lot of gore.I enjoyed it and I'm a big KeKe Palmer fan as well.
80381,"I have watched a lot  of BBC mysteries, and for some reason have totally missed this one. I found this on Amazon Prime, and so glad I did...it is really interesting."
80382,"Just a must for all my cars. K&N can't say much more, the performance Air Filter really works, and seems to increase my fuel economy somewhat."
80383,Well worth anyone's time to watch!  Says so much about upper class culture in the American SW.  Don't miss it!
80384,Alpha House was surprisingly funny and entertaining. The leaders of America are basically the frat guys of Animal House all grown up. Funny and lots of promise!
80385,very very good show lots of violence tho like the actors winona boyd arlo and the chief marshall watch if you can
80386,I did have to park on a very steep hill with my boat and trailer.  With just a brick behind the rear wheel always scared me.  I purchased these and now no worries the trailer is not going anywhere.
80387,love this show and especially the characters.  I like the great message Dog and Beth always share and it is fun to watch
80388,This cover is of very good quality and we're impressed with how well it's made.  It's heavy and sturdy and it feels and looks like it will last for a long time.We have a stainless steel 5-burner gas grill with the following dimensions - 64 by 21 by 37-1/2 inches.  We've had some problems locating a grill cover in the past that completely covered the bottom and we found it makes a big difference to how clean the grill stays.  We like a shiny and clean looking grill.  This fits very well on our grill and it goes all the way down to the ground. The cinch on the bottom of the cover is a great feature and works well.  It will also help to keep the grill clean from dust and rain.This cover looks very nice and overall we are very pleased.
80389,"Snark tuners are the most comfortable ones you can find. And they tune with amazing accuracy. If this model had a microphone to detect sound it might have been even better, but there's already another model for that. In one way it's better because sometimes the vibration and sound sensor works together to pickup other sounds while you're tuning, so this tuner is a pretty good choice."
80390,Bought this along with two detail brushes.  This one handles the brake dust that can be easily removed.  the detail brushes are better for the more difficult to reach spots.
80391,"Playback (Michael A. Nickels, 2012)Playback has the dubious distinction of being the lowest-grossing domestically-released American film of 2012 (it made a grand total of $252, playing on one screen for a single week). It's not the worst film I've ever seen--in fact, it's only the third-worst film I've seen today (and you never know, it might get worse after this!)--but that doesn't mean I would suggest you get within ten feet of a streaming copy of it.We open in 1994, with a young chap named Harlan Diehl (Dogman's Luke Bonczyk) killing his entire family save his sister's baby before being shot by police. Fast-forward fifteen years, and a group of high-school students, working on a project for their journalism class, are investigating the Diehl murders, headed by  Julian Miller (Purgatory House's Johnny Pacar) and his girlfriend Riley (The Master's Ambyr Childers). Julian enlists his stoner buddy Quinn (Black Swan's Toby Hemingway) to ""acquire"" some information that only the local police have access to; Quinn has an in to the police department in the form of Detective Frank Lyons (Christian Slater), an ephebophilic detective who keeps Quinn rolling in dough--or illegally-swiped evidence on the Harlan Diehl case, it would seem--in exchange for hidden-camera nudie-cutie flicks of the local hot high school chicks. The problem is, when Quinn gets his hands on the tapes, he finds that Harlan Diehl's legacy extends beyond the grave...If you haven't figured out within ten minutes of this movie starting what happened to the baby from the opening sequence, you haven't seen enough horror movies. That sort of predictability, unfortunately, plagues this entire production. Once you know all the principal high school students, you should be able to pause the film, sit down, and sketch out a list of who's going to die when. And you know what? You'd probably be close enough to right to be extremely disappointed in this movie. And you have every right to be; Nickles, a character actor (probably best remembered for portraying Jim Morrison in Wayne's World 2) who abandoned the screen to go behind the camera, does absolutely nothing to meddle with the formula. This is depressing, because given some of the angles this movie adopts (it would probably contain a host of minor spoilers to go into any detail, but I will say that my favorite character in the film, Wylie, portrayed by Galaxy Quest's Darryl ""Chill"" Mitchell, is a video-store clerk and would-be film historian whom Julian finds himself consulting more and more as they get closer to uncovering the mystery of Harlan Diehl's motivations), Nickels had ample opportunity to bend some corners, kick some sandcastles, what have you. And he took none of them.It's not necessarily a bad movie, but it is an extremely frustrating one, boring, predictable, and full of potential that will forever go unrealized. If you do end up watching it, well, you have my condolences. *"
80392,"""Project Runway"" is a perennial guilty pleasure. Cat fights among fashion designers, Tim Gunn's mentoring, Heidi Klum's Teutonic accent, there's fun for everyone. ""Project Runway"" is very much at home in New York City, especially when the three finalists show their lines at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week at Lincoln Center. The 8th season is a standout with its flamboyant characters. The drama at the Parsons School of Design is as much a highlight as the challenges&the; looks.The 8th season had fascinating challenges-using materials from a party goods store, aMarie Claire (1-year auto-renewal)challenge, using avant garde hats from Philip Treacy (who designed Princess Beatrice's hat forLIFE The Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton: Expanded, Commemorative Edition (Life (Life Books))), making a 6 piece collection, using First Lady Jackie Kennedy as inspiration, and L'Oreal make-up. During the 8th season, Alexander McQueen (Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty (Metropolitan Museum of Art)) killed himself, and Heidi Klum commemorates him.The 8th season had its array of characters- from Carlos Casanova, the middle-aged designer Peach, the Laotian Andy South, the granola/hippie-ish Gretchen Jones from the Pacific Northwest, and the inimitable Mondo Guerra. Mondo Guerra was a standout with his designs;he even managed to make his HIV+ status into a clothing pattern. Heidi Klum wore one of his dresses to the premiere ofBlack Swan. Mondo Guerra's journey in the world of fashion is particularly personal.""Project Runway: Season 8"" has a line of standout celebrity judges- Jessica Simpson, Selma Blair, January Jones ofMad Men: Season One. Make it work! The designers do indeed make it work."
80393,"I don't know how they do it. Each season just keeps getting funnier and more twisted. I don't care how much time they take between seasons, it's worth it. Everyone on this show cracks me up and I have no idea how far each episode is going to go. This is one of the best comedies I've ever seen."
80394,These were too small for my car so I am reordering the jumbo. I also wish they came in one piece to make storage easier. My old screen was two pieces joined by cloth and installed and folded up quickly. Having two pieces makes it more difficult to install (which way is up?) but I suspect it will get easier as I get used to installing.
80395,"Purchased this for my son who plays both Acoustic and Electric guitars. He's absolutely thrilled and loves this cleaner! Great buy, prompt shipping, great product!"
80396,"Didn't have the fun and quality characters of the original Stargate Series.  These characters were too self-involved, too much unnecessary sex, very little self-discipline.  Overall the characters were not people with whom I would choose to spend time.  the plots didn't resolve themselves satisfactorily.  Was disappointed."
80397,"I just received it. Being foreigner and use to the proper metric system, I still do not get a clear picture of how big things are when expressed in inches.In clear, this thing is about 46cm. This is as big as from my elbow to my extended fingers.Needless to say that this mirror is taking a huge place.I love it for the following reasons:- No more blind spot.- For those with children, you can check on them without any difficulty.- No need to turn your head anymore.Beware though that with the bigger mirrors that some cars come equip with, the clipping on may be be a bit more difficult.I am also losing the auto-dimming of my original mirror.In resume, excellent but ridiculously huge!"
80398,"LOVE THIS SHOW.  I PRAY SEASON 2 COMES ON SOOOOOON!!!!CANNOT WAIT!!!  I PRAY THEY FIND THE TREASURE ON SEASON 2,2, 4 OR MORE!!!"
80399,"THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU WANTED AND IT FITS IN THE TRUNK OR GLOVE BOX. i USED MINE TO RUN MY 12 VOLT IMPACT WRENCH TO REMOVE MY TIRES AND USED IT ON MY 12 AIR COMPRESSOR TO PUT MY AIR SHOCK UP..  ITS REALLY HANDY AND APPEARS SO FAR TO BE WELL MADE.  The WIRING MUST BE GOOD ENOUGH, AS IT DIDN'T GET HOT OR BLOW THE FUSE FOR A LIGHTER SOCKET.  SORRY FOR THE ALL CAPS, BUT I'M DOING THIS WITH ONE HAND,  SO DON T FLAME ME .."
80400,"It took a little working to get them to work to replace my 921 bulbs. The wire tabs come like this I I and the bases need to be bent out like this / \. They only work in one direction, so it takes a little patience to know if the wire isn't bent right or just put in backwards. They do not get hot like the old one and put off a clean white light instead of the usual yellowish light."
80401,"Lark Rise to Candleford follows the lives of the inhabitants of the poor, sleepy hamlet of Lark Rise and the more affluent and snooty inhabitants of Candleford during the last decades of the 19th century (sometime in the 1880s I believe). The central character Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) is a young girl from Lark Rise who is sent by her parents to work as an assistant to the postmistress, the capable and sensible Dorcas Lane (a brilliant Julia Sawalha). Initially Laura balks at the more restrained and formal way of life in Candleford, and is humiliated by the way some of the town's more snobbish inhabitants (such as the Pratt sisters, Pearl and Ruby, credibly portrayed by Matilda Ziegler and Victoria Hamilton) look down upon her, but she gradually finds satisfaction and a measure of happiness in her job and new surroundings, and comes to develop a true understanding of the inhabitants of both Lark Rise and Candleford, in all their complexities. Julia Sawalha is amazing in her role as the kind postmistress who acts as a sort of mentor to young Laura, and whose own life seems deceptively straightforward, despite some undercurrents, brought on by her close friendship with town squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to a city girl,the cool and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant).To delve too much into the plot would detract from the viewer's pleasure, and so all I will say is that this excellent series has everything to recommend it - a wonderful score, beautiful cinematography of the lush English countryside, and plenty of human drama, dealing with social issues, marital strife, forbidden desires, love across the different social classes,friendship, and lots of good old-fashioned humor.The ensemble cast is excellent and a delight to watch, engaging viewer's interest from the first episode till the last of the season, and I was sorry to see it come to an end. Luckily for fans, there is Lark Rise to Candleford, Seasons 2-4."

80403,"Pretty sweet guitar for the price. Sounds like and plays like a Les Paul. I really like the vintage sunburst color (It's more orange than what the picture shows). The strings were setup on the nut close to the fret board the way I like it already when I got it. I just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference. Overall, sounds and looks awesome! Would recommend it for anyone on a budget that wants the sound of a Les Paul."
80404,Works great as a stand for the Elec.Guitar. Work good in corners. And I like it For starting out learning.
80405,"Not overly impressed with the show -- it's just like every other Hoarder show. Some a little more disgusting than others. Pick those ones for the shock value only.Here's how it goes:&#34;People who hoard have issues and they usually wait until it's so far gone that they a) are getting evicted by their landlord or b) the county has deemed the house/apartment/trailer uninhabitable.&#34; That's the message through and through.The hoarder always has some reason for their behavior  and of course is reluctant to make any changes -- this goes on for at least a half hour. There is a crazy family dynamic going on where family members are estranged from the hoarder, mad as can be and &#34;don't want nothing to do&#34; with the hoarder. They all haven't spoken for a long time.  Soooo,  bring in some specialist in the psychological issues of hoarding (really? there is such a thing? Well, now apparantly there IS! What an idiot job... sorry about wasting your perfectly good educationon a TV show. Probably getting paid great and it serves your ego oh-so-well to be the 'expert')Then the &#34;clean up crew&#34; (who look and sound like they are always advertising their services) show up and make predictible  comments on the mess of it all. Then they done protective gear and start the clean up job.There might be a crisis moment at the point the clean up is underway. Of course, there is a serious time crunch of like, oh... say: 48 hours. It's so serious at this point, because the hoarder was so reluctant for months, years... whatever... but no matter....the hoarder starts freaking out and has second thoughts about getting rid of some piece of cardboard or the bucket of poop (seriously, this was in one of the episodes I watched!!) and everything halts while the family gets ticked off again, walks out, vowing that they are DONE with this nonsense. Bring in that specialist and have a come-to-reason meeting.... on we go with the clean up.Everything turns out good in the end. Or maybe not. To be honest, I watched two shows and just ended up feeling disgusted that main stream entertainment has turned into such a freak show. It must be the &#34;train wreck&#34; mentally.And there are SEVERAL shows like this -- some are &#34;Extreme Hoarder&#34; shows and some are &#34;Just Hoarder&#34; shows. It should just be a matter of time before the &#34;Relapsed Hoarder&#34; show is on the air.Hey, I want the rights for THAT brilliant idea."
80406,"I purchased this for my love of playing guitar. I like blues style and classic rock. This 25 watt amp will get the job done. It is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means. After a few months of playing the bass knob just blew. So I had no bass control. Arrived pretty fast and had no issues as far as tears or dings in the packaging. You just have to mess around with the knobs to get the tone you want. Took me like half an hour to get the right amp settings.This amp is rated 75 watts, so technically you could upgrade the speaker to say a 50 watt (into 8 ohm). I would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or Jensen. I'd recommend it, but don't buy it if your looking for a really decent tone. It's just a practice amp."
80407,"This is an exciting show that really captures the reality of westward expansion during  the industrial revolution. I've read some reviews that say that hell on wheels is more of a soap opera with brutality as a sub-plot but I disagree. I feel like the show captures the brutal, tragic and ironic reality of the west at that time...I will keep watching as long as they keep producing episodes. This series is anything but a soap opera..."
80408,"I have an older HavahartHavahart 1045 36-by-10-by-12-Inch Two-Door Cage Trap for Raccoons, Stray Cats and Woodchucksthat I've been using for years to catch ground hogs (woodchucks).This trap is intended for use by beginners.  It is perfectly suited to that task because:1) It is fully assembled.2) It can deployed from the box in seconds.  Simply position the trap, toss in some bait and cock the handle to set.3) Setting/clearing the trap is a one-handed operation that requires virtually no skill whatsoever.3) The metal hand guard gives additional protection when carrying an animal.4) You can release the animal using the top handle (unlike earlier models)If you trying to trap smaller game, consider the 1083 as an alternative:Havahart 1083 Easy Set/Release One Door Cage Trap for Small Rabbits, Skunks and Squirrels 17-by-7-by-7-Inches.  The 1085 trap is much too large for smaller animals.To be honest, my older trap was built better and has no plastic parts but it is much harder to set.  TheHavahart 1085 32-by-10-by-12-Inch Easy Set/Release One-Door Cage Trap for Raccoons, Stray Cats and Woodchucksis set by pulling the handle back which takes under a second.The following comments are for existing Havahart trappers who want to know how this (more expensive) trap compares to its (less expensive) predecessors.  Similar to other reviewers, I noted the  following:1) The rolled metal used to hold the cage together and will have to be replaced with hog rings.2) The Plastic carrying handle is held onto the hand guard with 2 small rivets as is the cocking handle.3) The hand guard is attached to the cage with bent metal tabs only.4) The cage is constructed inconsistently.  Spacing of the bars it tighter towards the ends - strangely favoring the fully enclosed end with the most reinforcement and leaving the center of the cage the weakest and the door end coming in second.  Others have claimed that large cats/coons can hunch their backs and exploit the cage's weakness by bending it to release the door and escape.  I don't doubt this given their determination to escape.5) The trigger plate on the 1085 takes more pressure than on the 1045 to set it off.6) The coated steel cable that connects the cocking handle to the trap door is thin and does not appear to be adjustable nor user-serviceable.  If the cable stretches or breaks, this trap would still be easy enough to set.I trap woodchucks using a simple method.  I find one of their holes and position my trap along a fence line with NO BAIT.  My score is 5 chucks, a skunk, an opossum and no coons/cats.The 1085 only has one door so more advanced techniques are required.  No even the dumbest animal is going to walk into an un-baited single door trap.  For the 1085, I covered the top so it looked more like a tunnel.  I baited the track with melon and placed it along another fence line where I know at least 2 woodchucks live.  Got my first woodchuck today (day 2) in an unbaited trap at the end of a fence line.  I laid a few boards on the side leading up to the trap to funnel in the animal.  I didn't disguise the trap in any way because woodchucks aren't to smart.Bottom Line: Yes, I recommend this 1085 trap.  The 1085 (this trap) is hands-down the easiest trap I've ever set.  Havahart did a great job designing this trap and it looks like it will last pretty well."
80409,"This show disappointed me because I wasn't looking for soft porn disguised as something else. The few episodes I watched reminded me of Weeds, except sex instead pot was the overriding theme woven throughout each episode. If you're looking for soft porn with some story, then you'll love this series. It has 3 seasons, so clearly I'm in the minority view here."
80410,"I enjoyed this first season quite a bit and it makes me hopeful for what's to come. While I liked the first half of the season, I didn't feel like the show really gelled until the second half, with the introduction of the vicious ATF agent they truly found a focus and a story line to build towards that made the first part of the season seem inferior and paled in comparison. That said, there is excellent production values from beginning to end, the acting is great throughout and the directing, while for the most part not revolutionary, is adequate and like the show improves toward the end of this season. I'm eagerly anticipating starting season 2."
80411,Wonderful and back to crimes! I love it love it love it its great so good it freaks me out
80412,"My husband wants to watch it, he seems to think there will be some kind of ending. The first three seasons were actually good. Now it is boring, the actors seem to be sleep-walking through their parts. They all have the same facial expressions in every scene. The killing seems to take place of a plot. There is not any depth to any episode, no thinking necessary. No kudos to the writers. They bring back the same old stuff, without any real new story."
80413,"Bought this strap for use with my Dean EVO electric. It's very nice and durable, though the leather on the ends was really tough to get around the strap holders on the guitar since the strap is really heavy-duty. It works great, though, and for the price it's wonderful."
80414,"I think I've tried everything now to get rid of fungus gnats.  This stuff didn't do much if anything.  The yellow stickies caught bunches but barely slowed them.  I let the plants dry until nearly dead, I tried teas, spices, soaps, Neem, and everything else I found or heard about. I finally got rid of them by scraping off the top 1"" layer of soil and replacing it with sand."
80415,"I lived in Dc 20 years and this bizarre overly blown sense of entitlement on Capitol Hill needs a bubble burst.  It's a great comedy, made funnier because it is only slightly more than the truth."
80416,The acting is very good and the premise is one that has always been a favorite with sci-fi/fantasy lovers. My only real criticism and what kept me from giving it a five star rating is that the  special effects and makeup could be a bit more realistic. Other than that - it is all thumbs up.
80417,A new series for intelligent viewers.  Maybe his wife didn't turn.  Time will tell as the series continues.  Even if has been blown to bits.
80418,"John Woo has created the biggest budget epic yet to be produced in China.  RED CLIFF (Chi Bi) is a monumentally grand film,  distilling portions of the novel of Chinese history, 'Romance of the Three Kindgoms' by Guanzhong Luo, to recreate the famous battle in 180 AD between the north of China lead by evil Cao Cao (Prime minister in the Han Dynasty)  and the south of China represented by the gentle and wise Liu Bei.  The historic battle took place on land and especially on water as the huge forces from the north traveled the Yangtze River to the pass called the  Red Cliffs (Chi Bi) where the southern forces gathered and came into ultimate confrontation.The story is told both by voice over (in English) and by the actors - a cast that includes such highly regarded actors as Tony Leong, Takeshi Kneshiro, Fengyi Zhang, Chen Cang, Wei Zhao among others. The interpersonal relationships are well constructed but the real thrill of this film is the choreography of the battle scenes.  The cinematography by Li Zhang and Yue L&uuml;  is splendid: the views of China's landscape are breathtakingly beautiful.  The costumes BY Tim Yip are complex and are apparently authentic in rendering the period.  The only disappointment is the musical score by Tar Iwashiro  which sounds too Western to fully enhance the visual epic before the viewers eyes.  The pacing is such that the greater than 2 1/2 hours of the film seem to fly by (apparently this is a condensation of parts I and II  released in China).  John Woo knows how to manage spectacle but he also understands the importance of emphasizing the human interactions that prepare the viewer for the explosive climaxes. Grady Harp, January 10"
80419,"This show is very intriguing and addicting.It has a creepy atmosphere and you don't know who to trust. Kevin Bacon stars as retired FBI agent Ryan Hardy. 9 years earlier, Ryan help capture Joe Carroll, an infamous serial killer who is inspired by Edgar Allan Poe. During his time in prison, Joe gains a cult who are devoted and will do anything for him, even kill themselves! When Joe escapes, he writes his own little sick twisted story about it and Ryan trying to stop him. For the first half of the show, the FBI are looking for Joe's son, Joey Matthews, who was kidnapped by followers Jacob, Paul, and Emma. The show does become a little repetitive, but it gets alot better toward the middle of the season. If you want a good thriller series, you'll love THE FOLLOWING!!!"
80420,pure magnesium anode is the best choice for my application.  Will buy again in 2 summers to keep the heater from rusting
80421,"I have never owned a pair of sheers so awesome these guys are very powerful and cut great.Ive tried cutting a couple thicker branches from trees but have had trouble doing so taking a few firm cuts, but if your looking for a great set of hedge clippers that give you a clean look then these are the ones for you.Mr Ellis recommends these shears and scores them an A+ you wont regret your purchase!"
80422,"I love Masterpiece, and this one is a great detective series set in beautiful Africa. The lead character actually get's pretty physical from the very beginning and throughout the series. Lot's of great acting and characters. The story line is top notch with even a little romance thrown in. Anyone who loves Masterpiece will love this. Enjoy watching."
80423,"Just as I've written earlier about J1 & 2, this series is well acted with actors not usually seen in movies. However, I recognize a few guests in the plot and I think that makes the story more interesting.  I look forward to Season 5 & 6. Sorry to know there'll be no more story after Season 6."
80424,"I'm really weary of buying things that are made in China. Fiskars is located in the USA. I'm unclear on the reason (RICH EXECUTIVES AND GREEDY BOARD OF DIRECTORS) why they would manufacture these snippers in China. Brings me down.Anyway. These are QUITE nice, very lightweight -- you will not be cutting anything more than thin plant material with these BUT they do reach in very nicely, nice thin blades. This operates on a naked steel wire spring, not a coiled spring, so I'm curious how long these are going to last. Comes with a thoughtful little orange plastic cone for the business end of the snippers.These are significantly superior to bonsai-type snippers or repurposed manicure scissors. Ideal for deadheading flowers. I love garden tools and these snippers are a real treat."
80425,"Ah, love to love the boys and their casts. Crowley's lost his charm, Kevin is a darling, the reintroduction of some characters we truly love and the boys having a ""home"" is great.. But the variations on the poor Sam getting a bit wore out. Would love to see this show go another five years, but, they are going to really need to get a decent story line, or better monsters.The introduction of strong women hunters (as well as demons) is always a plus.Stay tuned for possible revisions.Once again, the main or is it the side story, is a bit confusing and disjointed and doesn't seem to go anywhere.. It's night quite as bad as the Leviathan storyline- which actually was pretty good once it played out- but confusing. The show hasn't been able to recreate the Cas magic, and seem to want to refuse to, even when the potential is there. Meanwhile, we'll keep hanging in there just because, well, it's the boys.Stay tuned- spoilers from mid-season finale may change the majority of what is written above."
80426,"This little tuner is sweet! I put it on my strat-style guitar and it works brilliantly. Agree with another reviewer in that it would probably not work well on my Les Paul or Acoustics, but for the 6-in line guitars it's perfect. It is very precise and accurate, leading you to perfect tuning every use. I totally recommend this product - you won't be dissappointed."
80427,Love this show... The girls are so amazing to watch in competition.. The moms are a hoot...Abby seems a little harsh and seems to show favoritism but it is her show...
80428,I love this show it is well done and the cast is super. The story lines are engaging and well thought out clearly this series is worthy of inclusion in the PBS Masterpiece series.
80429,"Works exceptionally well. In fact, this works better than regular, single-layered pop filters I have used in the past and your sound is either not compromised at all or the sound is barely effected so that you would not notice.Well worth the money. The build and design of the pop filter is sturdy and can attach to a majority of microphone stands."
80430,But do recommend purchasing from Amazon* as best price so far .  - Now to figure out how to make an Elastic [pix] strap for even better comfort .. 73 yrs old and do tend to make things as easy as possible now - Lighter than the one used [neighbors'] 4 past 2 years as do both yards. Lighter and a little more compact and the two battery system will help to finish 2 yards in one day.  Only did one today - 2nd one tomorrow only because it is cool and windy.ADVICE: for easy assembly - see review by Ali Julia - with these tips and the pix and a whole lot of 'King's English' able to get together within half hour - then Used this am for a bit longer - maybe 10 minutes more power than the older B&D; model took before battery winds down. Always trim before mowing - easier on the mowing patterns then.
80431,"The product is here and I am glad the size is right. The colors punch out nice and will1. Help my vocal mics last longer so singers don't drool on my mics.and2. Help out during soundcheck. &#34;Hey, can we get blue turned down a little?&#34;Products were intact but on an quick examination I saw small tears in the foam. I will update if that matters in the long run."
80432,This material might have made for a better movie than a tv series. Can't imagine this sustaining over the long haul.
80433,This old fashioned battery filler makes it easy to maintain your RV and golf cart batteries.  Using this every three months will greatly extend the life of your golf cart and RV batteries.  The auto shut off feature means you won't overfill the battery.  Be sure to buy gallon bottles of distilled water to use in this.  Bonus - this product was made in the USA.
80434,"Here is another Terrence Malick film, following ""The Tree of Life"" only made one year before. Reportedly, ""To the Wonder"" is, like his previous effort, a semi-autobiographical movie of the director fiercely protective of his private life. Here Ben Affleck plays Neil, an American travelling in Europe, who falls in love with a recently divorced Ukrainian mother of one daughter Marina played by Olga Kurylenko. Meanwhile, Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), respected priest losing his faith.Though ""To the Wonder"" benefits from the poetic beauty of the images thanks to photographer Emmanuel Lubezki (who worked for the director's ""The New World"" and ""The Tree of Life""), the film itself remains an impressionistic collection of images. We are supposed to look behind these images and find something, while honestly I am not sure it's worth trying.I know Terrence Malick's unique filmmaking style, and I love his earlier work ""Days of Heaven,"" which offers a simple but intriguing story. In this newest film, what the director does with fragmentary images may be unconventional, but what happens in the film, if derived of its showy styles, is pretty conventional, even banal, together with the dull voiceovers. To me, ""To the Wonder"" is frustratingly pretentious and self-indulgent.I think I know ""To the Wonder"" is trying to do. It's about the feeling and emotion envisioned by the director. But people just don't cry or laugh. There is a context in which those emotions are expressed, and usually dialogue, story or character development provides that context, which the film refuses to do. This may have worked with other material, but if it's a love story, which is a very personal thing, well, I don't think so."
80435,"The treatment of character development, subtle sci-fi and people oriented stories is reminiscent of Firefly/BSG. Not that it is as good, but it does place it worlds apart from your average sci-fi."
80436,Appears very well built with a heavy powder coating which should last a long time hopefully??  Ball attachment was simple with a few large pipe wrenches and feels like it should last for years!
80437,"if you haven't seen the following yet, this is a perfect candidate for your binge-watchin pleasure. a compelling and well written series with excellent actors. this show is a treat!"
80438,"I hand to do some rewriting due to an accident and this adapter helped me. The diagnostic lights were very useful to troubleshoot the connections. The only complaint is that in my vehicle, a 2009 Ram, this adapter was big enough to block the other connector in my hitch."
80439,"Hummingbirds are some of my favorite tweets and as a consequence I've acquired a number of Perky-Pet feeders. One reason I like them is that they're affordable, and I've been able to get replacement parts like bee-guards which have kept my older feeders useful and clean.This current Perky-Pet model, the 209B, is really nice. It's got an ant moat at the top and little rails for the Hummers to rest on all the way around.  One of my favorite features though is the ease of cleaning and filling.  Cleaning is particularly important because while making a mess is just my problem (one that can easily be corrected), an unclean feeder can make the birds sick.The wider mouth glass battle on this unit makes filling and cleaning easy.  The glass bottle also threads into the base like a regular bottle/cap arrangement which has kept leakage to a minimum for me.Cleaning the base is easy as the bottom comes apart in two pieces, and I've found that if you take most of the fuzz off of a Q-tip that you can scrub the inside of the flowers, keeping them clear of debris and slimy buildup.The only downside would be the red dye in the sugar Perky Pet supplies. No one recommends food dye any longer. Use it --if you must-- but then use just regular sugar and water to provide nutrition to the birds.  The formula couldn't be easier. 1-cup cooled-boiled water or bottled water (without fizz or chlorine or additives of any sort) and 1/4-cup white regular sugar.  Mix and serve.This is a HUGE feeder, by the way, and I only fill mine with 1-cup of sugar-water because we don't get that many hummers (unfortunately too near the woods) and in the heat of summer it will go bad in a couple of days.  You might want to do the same too.Happy feeding."
80440,"never knew a fire fighter so didn't know what their work life was like. this is an informative documentary featuring fire fighters in Detroit, which is unfortunately experiencing urban blight along with extreme budget shortfalls. believably presented; I liked it. 3 and 1/2 stars."
80441,"What a great show. In six seasons it never disappoints. Everything about this series deserves all the accolades it gets. Now that its over, I'm having withdrawals! What an achievement. Proof that serial television can be on an even keel with great cinema! Superb."
80442,This show was great. What an exciting concept to base a show off of. It is going to be a huge success for Amazon if they make it!
80443,"This series provides a double whammy for the lover of crime. First, the team of detectives goes after today''s criminals, as in any contemprary police drama. But secondly, the device of the &#34;copycat murder&#34; permits the author to reconstruct the notorious crimes of yesteryear, in this case, the murders committed by the infamous Kray twins in the 1960s.This, second, series worked better than the first because the crimes are better documented and less shrouded in gothic mystery than the &#34;Ripper murders,&#34; the subject of the first series. Hence the detective-work carried out forty years ago seems more relevant than the confused, late nineteenth century documentation that required an eccentric &#34;expert&#34; who distracts not only the policemen but the viewer too. In the second series, the same &#34;expert&#34; returns in the role of &#34;researcher&#34; that makes him more plausible and, at times at least, barely acceptable to other team members.The inspector and his sergeant are an odd couple. The inspector is an upper-class chap with minimal understanding of how folk live in Whitechapel. The sergeant is the opposite: a cockney sparrow with prejudices against the upper classes that, in the first epsiode, seem insurmountable. Then the two become a &#34;duo&#34;...may be a little too quickly and a little too &#34;spiritually.&#34; But the two actors carry this off...for the most part."
80444,I bought this last year and used it on one house of mine in the late Fall.  Went up on the roof with a sprayer and sprayed the roof.  By this Spring the mold was all gone.  Between the snow and rain it worked gently and cleaned the roof.  What went down the gutters did no damage to my lawn or rain barrel water.  I just bought this container for a second home with the same issue.  I sprayed it on it last month so we'll see what Spring brings but I am sure it will work.  This second home does not have gutters so this will wash onto some brick steps with the same mold problem.  I am hoping it cleans those also.
80445,"Shortly after Roger Ebert began writing film reviews for the Chicago Sun Times, I moved to the area just out of college.  I've always loved movies but wasn't always aware that there were many other movies that never made it to the theaters where I lived.  Ebert opened my eyes to foreign films, independent films and documentaries.  But he wrote about all the big mainstream movies as well.  I figured out pretty quickly, the guy just loved movies...period.  What I always loved about his writing was that as beautifully expressed as it was, he was always speaking to the regular movie goer as well.This film directed by Steve James (""Hoop Dreams"") spends time looking back on Ebert's career from his early days at the University of Illinois and days at the Sun Times.  James also mentions Ebert's short-lived career as a screenwriter for the soft porn classic, ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.""  Ebert always chuckled at that failed experiment.  What wasn't mentioned was that in addition to writing reviews for Swedish classics, Ebert also wrote a few hard core porn reviews.  One I remember in particular was ""The Devil in Miss Jones"" (1973) which if memory serves, Roger liked a lot.  He was a bit of a rascal and the film gives us a good look at his hard living days that ended up with him in alcohol treatment.We learn that those iconic days on TV with Gene Siskle included some real life battles.  Some of the outtakes are very funny.  But one of Ebert's great regrets was not being able to say good-bye to his long time frenemy after he died of a secretly kept brain cancer.  Some of the more interesting interviews were with Siskle's wife, Marlene.  When Ebert came down with his own cancer, he decided to do the opposite of Gene and put it all out there for everyone to see.  He continued to write up to the end.The camera spends a lot of time, perhaps too much, on Ebert in his hospital room and in rehab, with his wife Chaz usually by his side.  The camera doesn't shy away from Ebert devolving facial disfigurement either.  Ultimately the film is an honest portrayal of his life, as the title comes from his own memoir.  He continues to be an inspiration to this 3rd rate reviewer.  Roger Ebert was the best."
80446,"We have a lovely garden and we would like to keep it that way.  Unfortunately, it is filled with prickly bushes and with growing things of all sorts to which, it turns out, I am allergic.  So before I got these gloves, a turn in the garden was followed in short order by many creams and then a week of anxious glances at my arms--this following a single instance when I did not put the cream on.  So you can imagine how great a relief these gloves were!  They come up just past my elbow and they are nice and sturdy.  I've had them for months now and they are still going strong despite all the abuse they've endured.  And unlike the other gloves I had before, they are well-fitting and I can feel what it is I am doing.  They are well-made, have a suede-like feel and the stitching is quite good.As others have noted, your hands do get a little hot in them.  But to me that's a small price to pay for the many benefits.I highly recommend them."
80447,"It works as it is inteded, to split the power and I have no issues with it. Good product! Thak you!"
80448,"Now, unlike Man Camp, or Answer This, I LOVE these kind of TV shows that keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what&#34;s coming next for these American Naval seamen after a worldwide viral pandemic has happen! There is plenty of action to keep you wanting more and to be on their side as they sail around a dangerous world to find a cure that seems so elusive to find. With NO MORE American Government, or any Government around the world, they are on their own! There are &#34;rogue&#34; elements out there on the loose as they found out in the very first episode....Russian Troops tried to Nuke them! The lady scientist on board ship is trying her best to find a cure, although you keep &#34;wondering&#34; about her, too. I have Amazon Prime and now it&#34;s time watch THE LAST SHIP....give me the Remote and that bag of popcorn.....with the phone off the hook.....let&#34;s see what happens next!"
80449,"I like the way this feeder looks and I'm sure I'll get a couple of good years out of it. It's been in my yard only a few days and already birds have been coming in to feed. While this may not be the case for first-time feeders, I have other feeders already, so the birds are quite used to using them.The copper finish is basically a coated steel, so I'm sure in a few years this will not look as good and the connected points of steel will definitely rust over time. The plastic windows which act as feed control are OK, but would have much rather had glass. In my experience, the plastic will break down over time in the sun and I've had this happen with several other feeders. After a few years, it gets crumbly and breaks easily.For 20 dollars, this is not a bad feeder, but not something you should view as long-term. FYI, I have a glass/wood feeder that was the first one I bought and it has lasted for over 20 years.Three stars, a nice looking feeder with some design/manufacturing flaws."
80450,i wish they allowed them to stay on longer.  I think this version got rushed along but I'm sure if they had more time for another season they would have developed everything wonderfully.  It is always entertaining and a show that should not have stopped so suddenly especially since they had good ratings for both of the last seasons and would have had even more success had they not been rushed to end with the last season before it really got started.
80451,Simple and useful rack stand. Easy to assemble. Easy to mount rack components... but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too. A little more interest in the manufacture means more quality.
80452,"Since, there are a lot HID products in the market.Its hardly to compare who is the most reliable product and seller. I observed from varies review stated that different products, either the light won't stable to work or seller had poor service, even though they skip away from their business. I bought this Kensun HID-H4 is base on the review and this is one had higher review score. so, I make up my mind to try one of it. It set up fast and simple(only 20 minutes), the light given out is straight sharp turn on and the light is bright enough to lights up all around.the Kelvin is quite close as its described. The Seller has instant response to any question you may have. In my mind, for such $80.00 or whatever, that is good enough. Compare to use high performance Xenon bulb, you will find it is worth to try one of this. Even it last for 2 years."
80453,These tools are handy to use and quite strong.  I like the hole in the handle.  It makes it easy to hang the tool to keep them organized.
80454,"Even though this is a Sci-Fi western type saga it is fresh and entertaining.  The plot, after earth is ravished by an alien race different alien species come together in the town of Defiance to survive and this slowly develops into an intriguing story.  My favorite characters are Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) called Little Wolf by her species and her adopted father The Lawkeeper (Grant Bowler) and the mayor (Julie Benz).  As the story moves along there are plot twist, action and some reasonable special effects and great make up for the aliens.  If you like good Sci-Fi give this a try, there is a lot going on so at times you just have to roll with it, but it's &#34;FUN&#34;"
80455,"All the seeds came up but they are growing pretty weird, like falling over and such. I don't think I will get anything out of them, they are too weak. I will try direct planting when the weather is better for it."
80456,"I use this in conjunction with the Terro Ant Bait and so far it seems to have done a good job of keeping the ants out. Though we use a commercial PCO, we still find ourselves in a constant battle to keep ants away. This treatment has been a nice addition to our defense and seems to work well if you are careful when you apply it and keep it close to the house. Any developing mounds that you put this on dry up within days. Easy to apply and good stuff."
80457,"I keep this in my camera bag, but I also use it on my tablet that has a glossy surface. The plush side, similar to velour, gets greasy fingerprints off the camera's LCD screen without having to use water or any type of cleaner that may harm the screen coating. The silky side is perfect for polishing the UV lens without worry of scratching it. This comes in a zip-lock-type clear vinyl storage bag. Wouldn't be without one of these! I was provided a review sample by Toddy Gear."
80458,I install a new anode rod in the water heater every spring.  It lasts for the year.  Easy to remove and install.  A must to keep your water heater protected from harmful elements in water.
80459,"I caught this film on HDNET as part of a sneak peak before it hit theaters. 'Vanishing on 7th Street' could have been a monumental horror film because it delivers so much in terms of atmosphere and genuine fear that is missing from so many horror films these days. The story starts out with a strange occurrence that draws you in and keeps you intrigued for the entire film. The clever use of shadows is creepy and effective and a nice change of pace from the usual gore and blood that is a poor substitute for true horror. It reminded me of the film 'Ghost'(yes, the romantic film with Swayze and Moore)when the ghosts come for those being damned and brought to Hell.The acting is way above average and the characters react like real people and do things one would think they would do in a situation like this. This film works really well on the big screen because you can feel the scope of the shear mass of this evil darkness that is taking over these survivor's world. Also, there are many instances where the shadows are alive, but it is done subtly and may be missed on a TV screen.My biggest problem with the film could also be the film's best attribute, the ending is left open to one's own interpretation, which will put some viewers off who want closure. For me, I would rather have this type of ending over one that gives too much explanation.......sometimes no explanation is better than a dumb one. ;-b"
80460,I love the crazy drama. I have been watching from day one. I will continue watching as long as the show comes on!
80461,Really enjoyed the episode..did leave questions but I am thinking answers are coming in upcoming season. Would have loved a bot more snowmen but it was a great episode.
80462,i started useing these about 3 yrs ago they are worth the investmentthere grat for a long performance takes alot of pressure off the shoulderif you have never used one befor try it you will like it
80463,"Good quality, wired correctly, can't complain.  If you use the ""One Spot"" power adaptor, you need to have a couple of these laying around.  It's probably not practical, but I wish they made more sizes.  In one configuration, I only need two plugs, in another configuration I need three, and yet another configuration I need five, so I actually bought a few of the fives, and cut them off to the length I need."
80464,I just got this series and only watched the first episode and thought it was absolutely fabulous.  Every single character is well rounded and portrays their particular part with such great output.  I am very eager to watch the rest of the series.  I was more than impressed with the entire show.  The old saying is that you have to see it to believe it.  This is the case here.  You most definitely will believe it.
80465,"I love that I can store shows on Amazon and not usurp all of the room on my DVR.  This show is so funny and it makes me laugh every time I watch it.  Whenever I need a pick-me-up or a funny distraction, I can watch an episode again and my mood is instantly lightened.  The romance between Danny and Mindy is captivating as well as humorous.  Thanks for the distraction, Amazon."
80466,"We've been feeding the little hummer for years, so when I ordered this &#34;new and improved&#34; feeder I expected one very similar to the ones we already own. Mrs. Spudman, who makes the sugar water for the hummingbirds is very happy with this new feeder.  We like all of its features -  the built in bee guard, the easy to clean base, the built in ant moat, and most especially the wide mouth fill. With the wider opening of the glass nectar repository, the feeder is easier to fill and much easier to clean.Amazingly, within several minutes of hanging his new feeder our first hummer of the season made its appearance. Since then we've had regular visits to the feeder which sits a few feet outside our large kitchen window.We're using the included red-colored nectar, but once it's been consumed we'll got back to the homemade brew without the dye.My only reservation about this feeder is the handy, but very small, built in ant moat. It appears to do its job, but on hot days the water is sure to evaporate quickly and need multiple refills. I actually prefer our large, clear ant moat that we hang above our hummingbird feeders. Small birds like to drink from these &#34;moats&#34;, and I like watching the chickadees use them to  bathe and splash about on hot, summer days."
80467,"Delightfully told, great dialogue, and fascinating stories. I guarantee you won't &#34;see it coming&#34;!This is a series that is great because, even though the stories are woven throughout the season, you can miss an episode, or even start up in the middle of the season, and still be able to catch up pretty quickly.It's just a great ride!"
80468,I found the storyline boring. Every character has been done before & the combination of 8 different people thrown together is old.
80469,Works great and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Quality is good and holds a microphone with confidence.  Great price too.
80470,"Study strap. Great feel, leather matches my instrument well. 2-1/2&#34; width worked well for me compared to the 4&#34; version."
80471,"I've had the canvas/vinyl grill covers in the past and they do the job but they are just 'okay' and start to degrade in the sun pretty quickly.This cover is made of really high quality canvas with a water resistant interior coating. There are two handles on the top to help lift it off or lower in back on.It is very large and easily covers our grill with both side tables extended. It would think it will do okay for much larger grills but make sure you measure first.It has a dual color scheme, a nice creamy beige for the majority of the cover and a dark brown at the bottom which will help to keep any dirt that gets splashed up from the ground or your deck. There is reinforcing white piping on the seams as well.The cover repels water and has an elastic bottom to help pull it in tighter.I am really surprised at the high quality of this cover, especially at this price point. It is top notch.I was provided a unit for evaluation and an honest review."
80472,"The instructions could be written much better but I really like having one of these, in fact, I'll probably get a second one to tie to the first one so I can include more instruments.I guarantee, if you get one of these, you'll have a hard time leaving it alone. You can even work it into your live performances."
80473,"ABC should be shot over and over again for not keeping this show. I LOVED IT! I only watched it because of the Amazon ratings. Someone at NBC should try to get it back. This was a gem with great plots, great characters, genuine emotion, and lots of humor---- all so very rare on tv. They made only a couple of mistakes: they needed a little summary at the beginning of each episode so you could get caught up if it was your first episode...you have to do this with continuing story lines. And, sorry, but I thought the lead should have been a bigger, gorgeous guy, although the guy in it was a great actor.BRING IT BACK!"
80474,"Ok So far so good!  Receieved it rather quickly which is good because we cannot wait to get started with hooking it up!Also it is a little bigger then we thought!  Even though it showed a picture of what was coming we ordered two kits because we did not think we were gonna have enough materials for our whole garden area!  Actually we probably only need half of the other kit to complete our garden area in our back yard and we were gonna order only one for the front!  After doing some measuring we will only need one and a half kits to complete the front but we will need more 1/4&#34; inch parts!  For those who feel they need to have something like this because if you are like us where my husband works all day, and I am disabled so by the time he gets home to water we are watering at night and that is not good as it promotes mold to do it that way!  Now we are awaiting the timer we bought so between this setup and the timer we won't even have to think of watering!  I have tried Dripline watering in the past and only using the 1/4&#34; is great but we needed a lot of it!  Now with the assistance of the 1/2&#34; hose we won't have to have so much 1/4&#34; hose and attachments!Also for those who are new to this when it starts to change season and cold whether is approaching you will want to actually take it all apart and bring it indoors as the system can freeze and brake apart!  Water can and does get trapped in the hoses and if that happens water when it freezes expands and will rupture!  You will loose parts in cold whether and or they can become damaged!  The 1/4&#34; accessories like sprayers and misters and so on are great but because how small they are, are very fragile!  They can become loose from the hoses also and can become lost and so on!  It is just best that you make sure the hoses are completely drained prior to putting them away and you might want a case for all of the attatchments so this way they do not get lost in the shuffle!If you are looking for a good system this is the one to go with especially if you need to either start all over or if you are only just starting out!  I do not know why we waited so long to get into micro irrigation!  If we would have known about this sooner then 3 years ago we would have been involved way sooner!As for how it shipped, Amazon you should be ashamed of yourselves!  How could you place these two boxes in such a large box?  And by the way the UPS delivery man said to me it was taped so poorly that he almost lost the contents out in the street!  The man managed to get it up to my door with box boxes in there, but hey you should try to consider using more tape!  What is it?  You can afford to buy more tape for your employees to use?  Or is it that you can't afford to use good tape that will actually stick?  Bad move Amazon, because if anything was missing you would have had to hear my mouth and I would have considered returning what ever was left to you guys getting a refund and never ordering from you again!  I swear its like hit or miss with you people!  You are 99% of the time sending items in boxes that are way to big taking a big risk with the items inside with getting destroyed and then having to replace or refund customers!  It's a mystery how you guys are still in business with how much money you must waste in replacing items that are destroyed from your poor packaging!"
80475,"I've been using these for about 3 weeks now - they are strong but flexible and don't seem to develop kinks or bending ""habits"" if you roll them up the proper way.I've seen and used some better cables but not at this price point.  And I've certainly seen quite a few worse!  This is a pretty good sweet spot, in my opinion."
80476,Found this to be very easy to use and am happy with this product.Pros:1) Just tear the bag open and sprinkle in areas needed in the yard.2) It seems to last a long time.3) Covers a fairly large area.4) Ants are now gone!
80477,"Terro 2 lb. Ant Bait Plus T2600. This container is easy to open and handle, no smell from the granules. It is better to hold the jug and squeeze it than to shake it. It spreads the granules out further that way and faster. I noticed that the ants were coming to the bait within 1 1/2 hours of putting the bait out. I really like that it is weather resistant."
80478,If you liked the old Dallas then you will love the updated version of this. The writers are brilliant without compromising the original. Little nuisances in both set and script keeps your dedication to the original. Can't wait each week for the next one.
80479,"Wrench off is a must have for my 1JZ swapped Supra. The filter is a pain to get to, but this makes it much easier to crack the seal with a 1&#34; wrench."
80480,"Ellen (Marie Ruane) is a woman living in an aesthetically cold, bleak, suburban neighborhood. She and her husband live typical, uneventful lives. Ellen finds relief from the pulverizing dullness through her photography. When a group of wild foxes turns up, Ellen begins changing, ultimately joining the pack. Her husband searches for her to no avail. When Ellen finally reappears, hubby may not like what he sees. FOXES is a 16 minute short film about the horrors of monotony and the mundane. It's about escape from bland reality. The title creatures seem to represent the wildness (liberty) we've lost, now that we've surrounded ourselves in flavorless, colorless modernity..."
80481,"These snark tuners are really cool.This SN-8 model comes this a metronome, and also you can scale up/down with buttons for when using a capo.highly recommended."
80482,"I've seen that a lot of this, this year, shows just seem to be phoning in their episodes... or, it's like a group of people sat down in a room and came up with some pretty decent &#34;situations&#34;, then stacked and glued them together to try and make a coherent script out of it all.Suits, when it first came out, season 1, I gave it 5 Stars.  It was extremely well done, and well acted.  Can't really remember how many times I sat and rewatched the episodes.Season 2, starting failing a bit, plot wandered, actors did things that didn't seem to fit the virtual simulations of them that I kept in my head (yeah, I know, I'm weird that way).  I rewatched some episodes, but the conflict between the main characters weren't what I was &#34;buying&#34; into.Season 3, even more so.  Some good scenes, but sharks are jumped all over the place to get to them.  The team member conflict is under control, but some of the logic behind what they do, how they do it, and some of the limitations posed on them by the world they live in (can't get a delay in a court case to show up a few days later?  I mean there's real world stuff out here, where the people involved have delayed things for over a year?).  Still I don't regret watching the season, acting (though implausible at points) is still good, characters are for the most part likeable.  Do I watch them more than once?  Not really.  Do I anticipate the next episode?  Not so much.Can't really comment directly on a lot of the goings on, without ruining what is still a quite watchable experience.Compared to some of the other stuff out there, this is still great, compared to what it used to be... I'll stick with the ride, but it's coasting at the moment."
80483,This little  hatchet has a well balanced feel when swinging and is great for chopping kindling and small firewood. Looks well made and would recommend it
80484,"These dual amplified speaker cabinets are something new for me, as I am used to the normal dual cabinet, one amplified set up like the Behringer MS16 which I was trying to replace with these, but on second thought will set them up someplace else, as they do not have front controls, have only one trs or XLR connection point, require AC power for both, and as P Frary has stated are VERY dependent on input; they kind of worked with my Stanton S300, and not at all with my laptop.They are (as stated by other reviewers) very subtle, and may take some getting used to. Because of the dual amps, you don't hear the sound travel from cabinet to cabinet, as each speaker cabinet is a stand alone unit.I actually hooked one up like a guitar amp, and it worked fine; just a little guitar amp that sounded great.For your normal Stereo mini jack and RCA hook ups, I would go with the much lower priced MS16's which have multiple RCA jack in points, and one Stereo mini and full front controls.Addendum: 10/13I finally hit a home run with these speaker when I hooked them up to Sony CD changer unit I have for the living room, dialed in the speakers, and put them both on one on/off switch.  The soundis full, and fills the room."
80485,I have watched many vampire movies and series but this one is good because it shows a 'human' side to the characters. They may be vampires but they are family.
80486,I was replacing the water pump and my vehicle is 9  years old so i decided to replace the tensioner also.  This is exact fit replacement and held on by three bolts.  It was definitely much stiffer than the old one I removed.  i think it is a definite to replace with this if your vehicle is more than say 6 years old.
80487,GOT THIS HOSE TO REPLACE MY HOSE I USE FOR MY BIRD BATH.THE 1/2INCH MAKES A STRONGER PSI TO SEND THE WATER.
80488,"This works well but effectiveness drops off after a good rain. The smell also doesn't make it a great candidate for use near entertaining areas. While fresh it is effective, but the need to reapply coupled with the smell makes it less useful to me. The sprayer itself was useful and made the application pretty easy."
80489,Probably better off using animal skin. This gets too wet and you have to keep draining it too often. D
80490,"Team Umioomi is a bit derivative; it uses the same conventions as Dora and other shows to ask kids to participate. However, the pattern and geometric object recognition aspects are wonderful introductions to mathematics. The episodes are never &#34;scary&#34; and they always seem to have a positive emotional outlook."
80491,The price and appears to meet all our needs.Appears well made and we are happy with the sent product. Thank you.
80492,"Let me start by saying that I never even opened these. I've given it a 3 star merely out of respect for Hohner. I have no clue how they play, so you'll have to look at other review for that info.I ordered this product based on the fact that the description states ""Includes a deluxe, red pro type hard shell case"". Well... not from Music123 it doesn't. When I asked Music123 about this, they said ""oh... well, we provide Amazon with our catalogue, and we leave it up their discretion to input the pictures and descriptions of our items"". REALLY!!!???Not only did this not come in the red case (which I didn't really care about anyway), it didn't come in any version of this case style (which I was interested in). The case that's shown, is the case that's sold individually on many sites for $19. So I figured... wow!... what the heck? I'm getting 7 harmonicas that cost $6 a piece if puchased individually, and I'm getting a $19 case with them. You'd be silly not to bite on that, right? Well... they came in a cheaper, nondescript black zipper case, not the one with the Hohner logo on it. Save your money and order this through Musicians Friend. It's the same price, free shipping, and you get the actual item as it's described on their site.In closing... it's been a week since I sent this product back to Music123, and I still have not received my refund. Do yourself a favor and avoid them!!!"
80493,"great show , the network is lame to shut it down. so get the word out and lets keep this on the air"
80494,I loved this pilot.  It shows me a world that I have always been curious about and makes it extremely interesting.  This is something that I havent seen before.  As I was settling into it like a comfortable pillow it was over!!!  I wanted more--immediatley!  I would definitely watch episodes of this series.
80495,"Good show as always. Really not to much new if you watch the other seasons,but we enjoy watching on a lazy day."
80496,"great picks,, they are shorter for speed and maneuvering sweeps better not to stumble in strings when sweep,, so for me it works fine i do use Th turtle purple big ext HH as well but i like to try this for experiment to see how it helps spleen on sweeps etc,, nice picks well made"
80497,"Quick Overview: A boy found in China is thought to be the long dead son of a local family. Carefully and diligently the townspeople and an outside INS agent search for explanations and juggle theories. They use DNA tests and even suggests looking at the boy's tomb. Emotions run high as both his family and the community handle his return.Omar Epps is fantastic in this series. He displays compassion and a determination to find the truth in a pretty convincing portrayal. The entire cast is exceptional and there's few film veterans on board.I think the plot is neat. While it is a science fiction saga, it isn't quite so out there as to make it impossible to fathom. It is modern and as down to earth as fantasy can be. I enjoy watching as family secrets are told and relationships are built and broke while the hunt for answers goes on."
80498,"Definite an interesting and riveting series.  Does not mince words or tries to make the Vikings anything but what history has recorded, but does give some great insight into probably how they lived.  Strongly recommended."
80499,"SUMMARYIf you aren't using locking tuners, you're wasting time when you restring. They are just faster and easier. Overall, this is a really nice convenience upgrade on guitars and it's not very expensive to do. Fender uses these on the American Deluxe, and once I got one, I had to have these on the rest of my stratocasters. Because they save time restringing, you are more inclined to restring frequently, which means you sound better. (Fresh strings can do a lot for your sound!)I've put these on several guitars I have, and always appreciate them when changing strings. At instalation be aware these are staggered height tuners so be sure to put them in the correct holes (see below). These are drop in replacement tuners for most modern MIA and MIM Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters that use a Shaller style tuner. Fender makes these relatively cheap now in chrome, although I wish they would make them affordable and available in a gold finish. I've seen also seen nickel and black, and they make gold but hard to find and rather expensive (something like $120 a set).FUNCTION/PURPOSEI think people believe these somehow give you more stable tuning or something but that is actually not their purpose. Proper use of a traditional non-locking tuner is just as stable. Some folks don't actually understand how to properly use traditional tuners and they don't get stable tuning as a result because they use too few or too many wraps and don't string it correctly. For those folks, these will elimiate the resulting ""pings"" and such. But their intended purpose is to speed string changes. I believe that some folks confuse locking tuners with a locking nut in that respect. A locking nut quite definitely makes for more stable tuning, and that's why you always find them with Floyd Rose tremolos which are made for dive bombing. But locking tuners are not really for that purpose.FIT AND INSTALLATIONRegarding fit, these have 2 little pins on the backside. If you are considering a replacement, make sure you get tuners that are the right size and configuration for your guitar so you don't have to drill the back of the neck, the tuner bores in the headstock, or use inserts. If you want to use these but don't have the little alignment holes, Stewart Macdonald makes a small drilling jig for drilling those holes. It's expensive (about $40) but not as expensive as messing up your neck or breaking the tuners when you tighten them down on ill fitting mounts. It is nearly impossible to drill those alignment pin holes correctly without a jig, and even with the jig, easy to be slightly off. These fit most newer FENDER stratocasters and tele's, both american and MIM and will be a drop in replacement with no muss and no fuss in most of those cases.Pull one of your existing tuners out and look at it before you change. If you have a squier or a knockoff you may want to measure the headstock bore and remove a tuner to look at the back mount. Maybe buy and inspect, with the knowledge you might have to return them. There is usually an exact fit drop in replacement locking tuner that can replace your standard tuner so if this isn't it, look for one in the same brand as what is on your guitar now. Be aware different tuners also have slightly different holes bored for the main peg hole.Typical neck bores for tuners (by brand) are shown on the warmoth site at [...]These are the holes that warmoth uses on custom necks when fitting tuners of various brands:- For Fender/Shaller tuners, its a two step bore, with the main portion being 25/64"" and the rest at 11/32"".- Vintage style tuners use 11/32""- Gotoh and Grover use a two step 13/32"" to 11/32""- Sperzel uses 25/64""- Planet waves uses 13/32""Of course, if you are mechnically inclined, have the tools, and don't mind potentially drilling additional holes in your neck, you can almost fit any tuner you want on any guitar. Sometimes that means using inserts or bushings, or drilling a hole for a tiny backmount screw, or for alignment pins in different locations...but the best answer is to use a tuner that is a drop-in replacement.When installing, be sure to look at the height of the pegs on your old and these new tuners. These are not all the same length -- they have staggered heights - 3 long and 3 shorter. (I think I have also seen some sets that are 4/2 but these are 3/3.) Put the long ones in the E-A-D string holes, and the shorter ones in the G-B-HighE holes."
80500,"I love the freedom the G30 gives me. I'm a real klutz with my cords...especially on the ML designed guitars. So I figured this product would actually end up saving me money over the longrun. The sound is a lot more, there. Between this & the Bill Lawrence humbuckers that the sound is unforgiving and those mistakes will come through real clear...making you work on your technique and become a better player.I took off a star because I don't like the prospect of being a slave to Duracell. I am hoping that rechargeable batteries will be good enough for my needs and I'll give it 5 stars.Side-Note: the 2 foot cord they provide was junk for me. I suggest ordering some better ones."
80501,"Just picked up the Korg pitch-black from Guitar Center yesterday. I use a Snark most of the time but i needed something i can tune with during practice while everyone is playing and making noise. love the thing so far. its accurate, fast, fits nicely on my pedal board and its metal not plastic like most tuners for this price. i like the multiple display options and calibrations. Mute function is awesome and true bypass i believe. great buy, i am happy with it. i got it in red."
80502,"I just started playing banjo and did not want to wrap up tons of money in supplies. This was a perfect ""kit"" if you will giving you everything you need to start at a great price."
80503,"This is one of the most hilarious shows on television today. The writers are great, and the actors fill their roles admirably. I own all seven seasons, and can't wait for season eight! Thanks!"
80504,"Like Orange is the New Black, this series both fascinates and depresses me deeply.  The stark reality of The Killing sucks you in and slowly holds you until it becomes a bear trap.  Each character becomes a real person and as you understand them, with all their flaws, the more you understand why they are who they are.This is not a masterpiece like Breaking Bad or even Dexter, but it makes you think.  It's other comparable series are Justified and The Walking Dead, although Walking Dead is pure fantasy with lifelike character development.What is starting to annoy me a bit is that it seems to concentrate more and more on pedophilic killings than I would care to see.  If there is a fourth season, I hope it moves to another area.My one huge complaint is the gratuitous and unnecessary use of tobacco.  I feel like I'm coming down with COPD, emphysema and lung cancer right after an episode.  Only 17% of adults and 19-23% of teens smoke anymore, depending on area and education.  While almost everyone in this series is so totally neurotic that it's not surprising they'd be weak enough to be addicted to tobacco, it's still unnecessary and uncalled for.  Watching the two leads act as if they're healthy, Sarah running and Holder kicking derriere, I still expect them to stroke-out during any given scene.It's not presented as ""healthy"" but it is presented as ""acceptable.""  To me, it interferes with the story and makes me hate every character that sucks on the most deadly addictive drug in existence.  If it's not there, you don't miss it.  Why have it to begin with?The almost constant rain and dismal settings do everything we need to see the depressing nature of The Killing."
80505,It does what it's supposed to do and the price is right so I would recommend it if you need to use pop rivets.
80506,I put these strings on every acoustic I own.  They sound great and are priced right!  You can't go wrong with D'Addario strings!
80507,"TIRE TREAD DEPTH GAUGE, IT WORKS, I NOW KNOW I WILL NEED TIRES A LITTLE SOONER THAN I THOUGHT, A GOOD BUY IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN PEACE OF MIND =)"
80508,"My daughter is seven and loves the show she's watched it 15 to 20 times over.  Has good characters, good storylines and good lessons to learn."
80509,"This is just an excellent product. I have been using this product on my guitars for over a year now and as long as they keep making it, I will keep using it. You only need a very little bit to polish the entire guitar and you don't need to use it for every polish. Once you put it on initially, you can simply buff your guitar with a dry cloth for the next two or three cleanings and the shine comes right back. There is enough in one bottle to last a very long time.I highly recommend this product and would like to also refer you to the Dunlop 65 lemon oil for cleaning your fretboards. The lemon oil very quickly removes any residue and shines the fretboard up extremely well. When it dries, your fretboard is beautiful and very smooth for all your bending and sliding tricks. 50 stars."
80510,What a waste of good talented actors.  Story line was so weak the we didn't even make it through half the show. Totally bored out of my mind.
80511,We love Olivia. She has such a way about her and it's fun to see how her imagination works. &#128522;
80512,"I'm pleased with the appearance of these on my nouveau plate cover, but they feel incredibly cheap and I don't expect them to stay on while driving down the road. I understand you need to be able to take them back off, but I feel like they're going to fall off on their own!We'll see how it turns out."
80513,"This series isn't for the faint of heart.  The writers have done a fabulous job depicting the area known as 5 Points with all the filth, corruption, child pornography, bigotry and political shenanigans of the time.  Husbands and Fathers is a statement on how one man can be caring, loving and nurturing of the woman in his life while another is just the opposite.If you're a history buff, this series won't disappoint."
80514,"Easy to install and keeps those D ring quiet. they hold firmly ( I haven't lost one driving down the road yet), and yet can quickly be popped out so your D ring can be used for recovery. It also works well at protecting your bumper paint."
80515,The &#34;KC HiLiTES 7210 Black ABS 6&#34; Stone Guard &#34; fit as stated and they look good and I am thinking about buy ing another set of KC Light's and the Covers as well. Delivery was fast and no damage to the product.
80516,"From the very first episode, we were hooked. Had to have the 1st and the 2nd seasons as soon as they were released!"
80517,"Interesting Brit Com. You don't always get the references, but it's always interesting.  And the characters don't lie to each other; they like each other.  What a lovely change of pace.  Also, it's written for adults, not kids, and it's comforting to watch for people over a certain age.Judy Dench is MARVELOUS."
80518,THIS IS SAD TO ME. I ENJOYED GOING TO EUREKA. IS A GREAT WAY TO END THE SERIES. YOU WILL ENJOY THIS AS WELL. GOOD BYE EUREKA
80519,"I am not big on animated stuff but I really enjoyed this show. The animation is cool, the main characters are cool and I like how its kind of a Star Wars Mockumentary. I hope it gets made into a regular show."
80520,"The program  captured my interest, but went a bit too far with graphic violence....part of the story, but sometimes a bit too much of it."
80521,"I got this pillow and decided to make a study with another pot that didn't have it, without keeping track of which is which.  I know it's supposed to keep the pot light so you don't need rocks for drainage, but I used a handful of pine needles at the bottom for the same purpose and planted some cockscombs in the pots and treated them identically.  Seriously, I can't tell the difference in the flowers that came up.The bag appears to be full of pieces of coconut husk fiber.  I don't think it's worth the money to get this when you can just put a little mulch on the bottom of the planter and get the same results."
80522,"Anyone anticipating ""The Samaritan"" to be a high octane thrill ride will probably have those expectations thwarted.  Truthfully, I also didn't expect much from this Blu-ray and thought it would be an exercise in conventional action mayhem.  It is, however, a movie with a lot more on its mind. ""The Samaritan"" is a surprisingly contemplative film about redemption and second chances.  Featuring a solid Samuel Jackson, the screenplay takes its time in building a genuinely interesting story.  Jackson gives one of his more complex performances as a man struggling to create a new life, a new identity, and start afresh.  He's great and the movie serves up some terrifically unpleasant surprises (the twist at the half way point is a doozy)!  But just as the movie approaches the final act, it falters.  An intricate con to swindle a crime lord out of millions of dollars is set up with almost zero preparation and back story.  If a clever grift is essential to your screenplay, however, it needs to be smart and believable (or in some cases breezy and fun).  This one is so ill-conceived (major players change out hours before the meet, this must be one idiotic crime boss to not check out ANYTHING) that it almost derails the picture just when it's reaching the most pivotal moments.Jackson plays an ex-con, recently paroled after a 25 year stint.  He wants to live a quiet life, but he gets drawn into the criminal world again by the son of a former associate (Luke Kirby).  Although reticent, Jackson allows Kirby an entrance due to the fact that he was personally responsible for his father's death.  When a young woman in Kirby's employ (Ruth Negga) comes between the two, it just might be the leverage that Kirby needs to get Jackson to sign on for a job.  Can Jackson extricate himself from an ever-tightening web?  The build-up leads to a final confrontation (Tom Wilkinson plays the mark) that is effectively staged and emotional.  But it really falls short in a set-up.  Without believing anything about this final scenario, it really lessened the impact of the movie.  The vibe of the film is gritty realness, this ending just didn't follow through on that promise.Still, if you are a Jackson fan, this is one of his more nuanced roles of late.  Beaten down by life, his detachment has a chilly truth.  He is still a great actor capable of showcasing complex and multi-leveled roles, and this definitely qualifies.  I liked Kirby's cool menace as well.  Once again, ""The Samaritan"" works best when considered an introspective character study.  It is marketed more as a non-stop action movie, though, and that really doesn't address the primary audience for the movie.  This has a slow burn pace that builds tension.  I just wish that the payoff was smarter.  I went from being deeply engrossed to rolling my eyes in disbelief within minutes.  About 3 1/2 stars.  Let's hope Jackson keeps taking more challenging roles.  KGHarris, 9/12."
80523,"Love this hummingbird feeder, and so do the hummers!  Within minutes of filling the feeder and hanging it I had a hummingbird, and she's been coming back ever since.It's a nice design, looks a lot classier than the ugly plastic red ones you can buy for cheap.  Easy to open, fill and reassemble.  Looks great hanging outside.I just wonder why the free nectar was not enough to fill the feeder, it fills it about half full, which is better than nothing!My birds are happy with this product and so am I."
80524,"I think someone else also mentioned the similarities to The Incredibles, and I have to agree. Even the opening music was the same kind of music, as well as the whole opening title sequence...it was just too similar. You might want to rethink that if you don't want your audience to think ""Hey, is this The Incredibles II?"".Also, while the script is mostly good, you really need to ditch all the references to other movies. Do you want your audience to remember YOUR movie, or all the references to all those other movies? I mean, people quote movie lines because they were memorable and unique, so that's what YOUR script should be - UNIQUE. It should be able to stand on its own without having to steal from 50 other movies in order to get a few laughs. Speaking of laughs, I LOL'd when the brother called the sister shrew-zilla.I disliked the stereotypical self-centered daughter. I mean, I am SOOOO tired of all teenage girls being portrayed as whiny, selfish, superficial morons who only care about one thing - themselves. Whether real teenage girls are like that or not is beside the point. You need to show her as being a little deeper than she is otherwise her change at the end is too drastic. And why not show girls that they don't have to act that way?The evil dude, Flamingo or whatever his name is...his sole motivation is that he's pissed because the original Grim Avenger made him turn pink? Really?! Yeah, that just didn't work for me. I realize he's supposed to be a psychopath, but still...he needs more to drive him than that. Otherwise, he's just too one-dimensional and boring.At about an hour and fifteen minutes in, I actually got really bored. It needs to be tightened up around that point. The whole set-up is good, but it kinda slows down there, and then picks up again when the kids get taken and the dad realizes what it truly means to him to be a super hero. That part was good, if a tad overly sentimental. The whole ""family"" message is good and all, but maybe don't shove it down our throats so much that we gag on it.I hope my review doesn't sound like I absolutely hated this movie. I think it's a good premise, and the message of being a family and working as a team is a good take-away. I just think the writers used too many other sources to tell their story. If they can figure out a way to tell THIS story without taking so much from elsewhere, it'll be really good."
80525,"I'm prepared to jump a car when the battery is dead whenever it occurs, in any weather conditions and for any size engine.  This battery weighs almost 29 pounds.  We keep it fastened to 300 pound capacity multipurpose 2-wheel dolly.  I keep the heavy jumper cables that came with the unit on that dolly.  That's been doing the trick.  I don't use it for anything else.  We've kept the DC charging cable in the accessory bag.Because of our insurance, we keep our instructions attached to the dolly with a laminated sheet.  This includes warnings about making sure the area around the battery is well-ventilated, not to allow flame near it, not to touch a metal tool simultaneously to the positive and negative cables ends, remover personal items such as rings, watches and any metal from your hand or wrist, remove positive terminal first and avoid touching eyes when working with it.  The instructions give the whole sequence for jumping a vehicle engine and also instructions for recharging with the AC charger.This battery has protection against overheating or a surge.  It comes with a replaceable fuse that protects against reverse polarity and short circuits.  You can read the battery's charge status on the digital display as well as output information in green.  You have the battery's charge percentage light.  And the charging status light is on when it's plugged in, flickering when it's charging and remaining green once fully charged.  When the battery is fully charged, you get a very useful incandescent light that lasts a very long time too.  It has 3 AC Outlets for supplying the 120 V of AC power, but it still takes hours to power up.  The instructions say it can take up to 35 hours if it's fully discharged.One thing I didn't need is the radio or alarm clock.  This will be important if you take the battery into the wilderness with you, not as I use it."
80526,"I am a Master Gardener, which in my state means I need to have continuing education each year and teach minimum amount of hours.  We can't teach old wive's tales, just scientifically proven plant info (but some of the old wive's tales have been proven, so they are O.K. :-) ). These upside-down planters have been a big discussion point and unbiased studies have been done on their effectiveness.  They have been proven to produce less than conventionally grown plants.  I am giving two stars for the novelty factor, but I would never recommend them for anyone who actually wants tomatoes.More work + more expensive + less fruit = thumbs down"
80527,"We mounted this on a wooden fence near the garden. I combined it with one of those &#34;expanding hoses&#34;. Works great. Appears built to last. Extremely thick powder-coated metal is really nice too. Not fancy, but really durable."
80528,John Cleese is one of the funniest people on earth.  I wonder whether there were actual scripts for this old show.
80529,"I replaced a problematic bird feeder with the [[ASIN: Perky-Pet birds and berries lantern feeder]].  While the screen printed design didn't interest me, the bird feeder itself did a good job of feeding birds and thwarting squirrels.  Being so pleased with the Perky-Pet bird feeder, I decided to give this more visually appealing option a try.The Perky-Pet 325S panorama wild bird feeder, made in China, is a cylindrical double bird feeder.  In the center of the upper feeder is a tube, which when filled high enough, will drop some seed into the lower chamber.  Once seed falls below the top of the 4.5 inch tube in the 6.5 inch tall chamber, seed no longer falls through to the lower level.  The shallow .75 inch feeding tray has drain holes placed about 2 inches apart to prevent moisture build up, and is encircled by a perch ring 1.25 inches from the edge of the tray for birds to rest on while feeding.A short metal cable runs through the center of the feeder, allowing the top to stay securely in place.  Adding seed up to a maximum of 4.5 pounds requires pressing a button to release the tension and allow the lid to slide up the cable.  The bottom chamber can also be opened up for filling if you would rather not deal with the upper tube or use two different bird seed blends. Fill with seed, align the parts, and press the button again to secure the top back into place.  As the birds feed, the separate compartments will empty independently of each other.When I removed my Perky-Pet 325S panorama wild bird feeder from the box, it was clearly damaged.  All the fastening clips from the upper plastic surround had broken off, leaving sharp jagged edges to cut myself on.  Fortunately the bird feeder still assembles securely without any difficulty.  Even so, I went to Perky-Pet's website to request a replacement part.  They offer live chat, although it wasn't available when I attempted to use it.  Instead I was given the option to send an email.  I received a response three days later indicating I should try to resolve the problem with Amazon.  If I found Amazon unwilling to resolve the problem, Perky-Pet would allow me to file a warranty claim.The Sure Lock Cap system keeps squirrels out of the compartments themselves.  However the shallow feeding trays cause seed to fall over the sides as small sized birds peck and push at the seeds.  Getting into the bird feeder is unnecessary as there is so much seed on the lawn for big birds and squirrels to enjoy.  I'm not sure the Sure Lock Cap system really matters on this bird feeder.When it comes to keeping squirrels away from the seed, the Perky-Pet birds and berries lantern feeder is the better choice.  However, the Perky-Pet 325S panorama wild bird feeder attracts more birds feeding at the same time and brings larger birds to the yard to feed on fallen seed.  The Perky-Pet 325S panorama wild bird feeder is worthy of consideration, although it may not fit everyone's needs or desires.PROS:YouTube channel provides bird feeding tipsWilling to resolve customer issues12-month limited warrantyCONS:May keep squirrels out of the seed compartments, but they will still enjoy the seedSlow customer service response timeArrived damaged"
80530,"Works great easy to use with the spray pattern and seems to last a good amount of time, even after washes."
80531,Contains all of the Onion's unique biting satire and promises to lampoon the pretentious nature of news anchors and workroom dramas at the same time. Great casting and constant hilariousness. This is my pick.
80532,"After cannibalizing nearly all of TOS series, they ran out of ideas. This one is so, so lame.Their fantasy of Trip-the George Bush-ish NASCAR like mechanic-that beds an exotic beautiful woman and has an immaculate conception. Whose twisted fantasy is this. Lol. And then of course it is back to the evil man and his evil machine to kill all other races, echoing the Nazis in the first episode of this year's shows. This is new? This show is so full of mish-mash tripe that I am so glad there are no more. This last season was certainly painful to watch. I did enjoy most of season three however, and the overriding story arch with the unusual harshness of the decisions Captain Archer has to make, making it a truly deep emotional engaging show. The first three seasons were good overall and this one is a plane going down in a ball of flames. This next to last episode is the crash with the fireball."
80533,They sound just like i thought they would.  I love them and use them when i play guitar and they sound awesome.I would buy these again.
80534,"Consistently, one of the best dramas on TV-well acted, with plot lines that are more realistic than many might believe. Highly recommend."
80535,These are easy to use and perform well as expected. Delivery was fast and the contents were unharmed. The price is higher than comparable products but that is the case with all Gardena items. Worth the extra cost.
80536,"Being a police procedural freak, I found this series like nothing I had ever seen on the screen.  The starkness of the countryside painted a back drop for the characters living and working there.  While crime and murder come into play, I found the character development to be what actually made for a 5-star review."
80537,"This show needs to do something. The season finale involved a guy digging in the mud and coming up with nothing. Not a guy with a back hoe excavating a secret tunnel entrance but a scuba diver lifting much for a few minutes. I want to know about the mystery of Oak Island as well. Not the history, Wikipedia has that covered but what's under the ground. If this show is going to make it, season 2 is going to have to involve some actual searching of the island instead of meeting with elderly people who have crazy ideas about it."
80538,"We recently purchased a new-to-us home in a nicely wooded area. Within a few weeks of moving in, we realized that there were more than a few hummingbirds around... about that same time, we came across unused (new-in-box) feeders while helping my mother clean her garage. This all seemed like the making of a fun hobby, and we have not been disappointed.one of them was a Perky Pet 8 ounce feeder (Perky-Pet 203CP Pinch Waist Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder) and the boxed set she she came with one packet of this nectar, which we found to be easy to prepare (very nice, since we really only have a couple minutes to get-it-done as we head out to work early morning).We cleaned the dust off the feeders, loaded them with nectar... and then nothing really happened for the first few days.  Just as we began to feel a bit of disappointment, we were encouraged when we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit.Following directions, we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started! As week #2 of our feeder experience really got underway, the feeders emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day. Guess the word got out!By the middle of the fourth week, the 16 ounce feeder was emptying every 2.5 days or so and the 8 ounce feeder in a day or two. We had wonderfully colored green, yellow, blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs, and they are awesome to watch. They love this nectar, flying in to land on the feeder's perch and sipping until content, then buzzing right off. There were even times when hummers seemed to do a little battle for prime sitting position, with the 'winner' forcing the other one(s) to hover just a few inches away (im)patiently waiting for their tuns. Very interesting and beautiful to watch.It's November and night-time temperatures are dipping below freezing, and our hummingbirds seem to have migrated away now. Can't wait to get the feeders and nectar back out in the Spring and watch them frolic again.Highly recommended! Totally fascinating."
80539,"The concept is engaging--a scientist receives warnings from somewhere in space that catastrophic events are going to occur and a team of police and scientists set about attempting to divert these catastrophes from happening--with varying success.  The series would be more compelling if there were a gradual unravelling of the mystery behind the signals.  This is a single, plot-line show where a dual plot line--one that reveals an alternate reality beyond what is happening in real time--would have provided depth and thought-provoking meaning for audiences.  The female protagonist is excellent.  The brooding male scientist comes off a bit creepy instead of troubled as he is meant to be, I believe.  If you want something border-line sci-fi and still engaging, try Warehouse 13, Touched, or 666 Park Avenue."
80540,This is a great show.  The acting is fine and the plot line is absolutely great. Well worth the price.
80541,Ernie Ball makes extremely durable products and has a very reputable name in the musician community.These strings are affordable and last a VERY long time on someones guitar during normal use.You will not be disappointed in this product.They sound VERY clean and bright and if you use a product like GHS Fast Fret after playing the strings last twice as long and stay clear and bright longer.They do have a coating that will wear a small amount and turn black under the strings if you fail to clean them properly.
80542,If you like being strung along with multiple mysteries on many episodes this is for you.  I do like the cast and the ability to watch an episode every other day so the story line is fresh in my mind.
80543,Love the show! Super funny! Enjoying it whileit lasts! Before they get into telling to deep of stories and it turns into some weird nerdy soap opera......it always happens......
80544,"Ken Burns' production PROHIBITION is done in the traditional format of Still photos and interviews and some file footage. The program goes into a fair amount of detail as to the origins, ramifications and impacts of this experiment in legislated morality. I particularly appreciated the insight the show provided on how much this part of our history has influenced the country we have become."
80545,"For those who have not heard of this show, you have to go into watching Tosh.0 with the understanding there is nothing sacred or untouchable when it comes to the subject comedy and humor.  This can be extremely funny and refreshing (in a society hell-bent on allowing itself to be subdued by a politically correct police state) - but the extremely funny bits are surrounded by seemingly endless acres of the same recycled potty humor in order to fill the creative voids (of which there are many).A large chunk of the show is apparently aimed at adolescent minds - but the show as a whole is completely inappropriate for all non-adults.  Incessant and repeated &#34;b-hole&#34;, vomit and other assorted potty humor is the normal subject matter.  Graphic and many times violent internet videos are used as the centerpiece and subject matter for much of the comedy.  So consider yourself warned.Again - race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity - and pretty much anything is/are all fair game in this show&#8230; and the satire should be obvious for some.  Nevertheless, do not watch if your overly sensitive and easily offended - because if you are, this show will offend you.  Enjoy!"
80546,"Usually a lot of shows don't make me laugh out loud but this one did and shows a lot of potential, kind of reminds me of Entourage"
80547,"I love this series. This is the third or fourth time through for me. The characters of John Shepherd, Tayla, Dr Weir, Ronan and Dr. Becket and Dr McKay are unforgettable. It is a wonderful space fantasy. Whenever I want to escape into another world I go to Stargate Atlantis. I imagine how cool it would be to travel to other worlds through a stargate/wormhole and meet other people who of course speak my language, English. The SG-1 series is good too and was the beginning of the Stargate series. In the beginning of Stargate Atlantis Jack O'Neil passes the torch to John Shepherd. Very cool indeed."
80548,"I have seen season 1, and I actually saw season 2 when it was on TV, but I watched this again with Amazon streaming.  I just love this show and am anxiously awaiting season 3.  The special effects are what makes this show and they are so well done.  Nick's partner, Hank, had to be told what was going on, and it was a truly funny episode.  The person playing Monroe usually plays a heavy on TV, but he is so likable, and you're pulling for him to get his love interest going.  If you have never watched Grimm, you are missing the best show on TV.  Start with the very first episode in season 1 and go from there.  You won't be able to stop watching."
80549,Ok so I ordered this on Friday and got it on Monday as I have Prime. This was expected and I'm glad I got it so fast. But I wasn't to sure about the packaging. The bubble packaging had all popped and there was really nothing in the box to keep the Kensun kit from bouncing around inside.Well I opened the package and was inspecting everything when oh and behold a wire falls out of the hid bulb. Literally fell right off! So I've called the customer service because I've heard good things about them and their service. They were kind enough to listen to the problem and said they would send out a replacement bulb which would get here by the end of the week. So as far as this product goes so far I'm giving it 3 stars until I get the replacement bulb. I'll be testing out the good one today and see how it turns out. Aside from that I do admit the customer service was good and the rest of the product looks in good condition...so far.Update:  3 weeks later.So I've loved the new look of my fog lights. These are amazing at night and the color is just right. I have to say that they were a little interesting to plug in and other than the issue I wrote about above I haven't had more. Kensun has been kind enough to help me replace the defects on the product and seem actually interested in the quality of their product to me. So far I'm happy with the product now and the customer service they offer. Therefore I've upgraded my stars to 4 for these guys. I most likely purchase from here again.
80550,I didn't know until opening the package that this would be so vulnerable to pets. My hog dogs aren't that smart that they wouldn't eat this stuff up.
80551,It's a pretty great sampler to get a feel for the types of picks that you may like. I also prefer the feel of these over the plain plastic ones but thats just me.
80552,"I bought the entire season of Touch and loved each interesting aspect of the series!  My video was a good stream, and the stories were excellent.  I would recommend Touch to anybody."
80553,"I gave Warehouse 13 Season 3 3 stars because they kept up with some (not all) of the quality that all the other Warehouse 13 seasons had. I didn't like the fact that they felt the need to bring in a homo, just to keep up with the fad of other shows. The character did not fit; it was like they just tried to shove him in there to make a statement. I would recommend this to those who liked the other Warehouse 13 seasons and those who enjoy Sci-Fi."
80554,"Monk's 6th is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season, Monk must deal with his crazed fan, help a rapper, teaches Julie Teeger about love, hang out with his psychiatrist's son, shoots Santa Claus, joins a cult, becomes a fugitive, and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON SIX!!!"
80555,"This is everything you need in a tread depth gauge, and nothing you don't. Here's how you use it: You press the &#34;probe&#34; down into the tread gap to measure the depth. You then rotate the cylinder around to match the exact mark to the line. The measurements are on four sides of the cylinder, making them easier to read than being stacked on top of one another. Being able to rotate the cylinder makes it much easier to measure something as minute as 1/32 of an inch."
80556,"I purchased this ""kit"" because pricing the items individually made it more than the kit.  I didn't really care about the work gloves or line dampener, but Ill address those two items first:Work Gloves :  You can not pick the size of the glove and it appears that Rugged Ridge places size large in the kit.  I wear a medium glove and these are slightly to large, but still wearable.  The quality of the glove is rather poor.  I didn't expect top shelf, but they are very thin.  Any ""heavy duty"" use and these gloves are going to come apart.Line Dampener:  This item comes empty and is nothing more than a thin plastic bag with two pouches sewn on to it.  It states to fill each pocket with 5lbs to give the bag weight.  As I believe in safe winching practices, this would be good to fill with sand and have sewn shut, but there is no way to do this.  You could use dirt/rocks from the trail to accomplish this, but as thin as it is, Im afraid it would rip.  Seek other options.D-rings:  There are two, 3/4"" d-rings included with this kit.  The are rated to 9500lbs and are galvanized gray in color.  They work like they're supposed to.  No complaints.  You should buy more d-rings, however, as two just aren't enough for the trail.Snatch block:  The included block is pretty nice.  It performs as expected and does it well.Tree strap:  It may seem a bit ""small"" to some at 6', but I have had no troubles in the Southern part of the country in it's length.  Someone suggested it should be at least 10' in length, but 6' has been plenty for me, 10 would've been to long to be effective.  Stitching is ok, not great, but up to par for price point.Recovery Strap:  This is a good length unless you're in a tight spot.  Has adequate ""flex"" and does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Stitching seems ok for the price point.  It's also up to par on the industry standard in pulling capacity (for casual off roaders, not competition off roaders).Storage Bag:  Definitely a weak link, but works.  Im able to store all of the items plus extra d-rings in the bag.  The zipper on the back is extremely frail, but mine hasn't broke (yet).  Be careful with it though, as it just ""feels"" like looking at the zipper wrong will cause it to bust.I have used these items on the trail a couple of times.  It did what it was supposed to and that's what mattered.  I am not disappointed in my purchase, especially for the price point.  Items made by others cost significantly more (but also of much better quality), so for the price point its good.  I would buy again and recommend this item to the casual off roader, not the competition sort."
80557,"I am not a professional automobile detailer. However, I ordered this product to see if it could shape up the looks of 4-5 year old tires. My answer is yes it does. I compared the effects to my local dealer and what they do to make their pre owned inventory look good since I was there having my car inspected. The results are comparable. Any early ""dry rot"" magically disappears. I do not know what this does to improve tire life. All I can say is it certainly makes them look good. And good looking tires increase resale or trade in value. It may even help to prevent dry rot the same way waxing protects the finish of a car. I give Lexol Premium Tire Shine 5 stars. It is easy to apply with minimal mess or fuss. I highly recommend this product."
80558,I love the dynamics of this family. Each of them thinks they're the only one harboring a secret. It's definitely a look into how complicated family relationships can be.
80559,"I've had my hot tub for years and getting the right chemical balance and clean, clear, nice-smelling water can often be a puzzle. The key is having the right combination of products and using them consistently. I think it's also important to change the water and filter regularly, and also to try to limit the amount of contamination the water gets from users who wear lotion, oils, perfumes, bug repellants or whatever into the spa -- along with a suit that may have been washed using soap.That said, I've found this liquid enzyme product to be very effective in controlling organic deposits and in making the water odor free and clear. I add about 15-20 mL (a little over half an ounce) of the liquid in my hot tub along with my brominating tablets andRenew 2.2 lb Leisure Time Spaeach week. I sometimes add a little extra of the spa enzymes after I've had a large party of guests. I maintain the water temperatre at around 100-104F as the product is designed to use in warmer water. I keep my spa open and use it all year long and it seems to make my other sanitizing agents work more efficiently to maintain a good chemical balance. I also like that you can use the spa immediately and that you don't have to circulate the water for long periods after adding in order for it to work. It does not cause skin irritation or dryness. I've noticed less scum along the walls of the tub as well! I'm all about less maintenance and am quite pleased to recommend this item."
80560,"I like this hose. It is a dedicated hose for flushing my black tank. Works very well and seems to be a good build, good quality, good price, and works great. Will update PRN."
80561,"It's perfectly fine for standard, fairly stationary use. We use these at my church, and they get moved around a little bit, but not much. For the price, they are surprisingly solid, and they work perfectly fine.Of stands in this price range, this is at the top of what I've experienced.It's easily adjustable, the screws stay tight once adjustments are made, it's light but not so light that it tips or blows over, the feet keep it steady on the floor and from wobbling.Seriously, for those who don't need a stand that can handle touring or lots of fiddling around, this is the one to go with.If you need a stand to handle doing live gigs and/or going on tour, shipping around in airplanes or vans, etc., you will need to go up a notch or two in quality (and, sadly, price)."
80562,"I love this hose. It acts in some respect like a fire hose.  It builds up pressure and expands and contracts as needed.  So far it has handled the stress well.  The brass valve is awesome and lets you generated a stream up to about 20-30 feet in addition the length the hose stretches.Update 7/4/2014 - going to need to take off some stars.  The hose basically exploded this morning.  So after about only 4 months of use a few times a week, it seems to have suffered a catastrophic failure.  So not great product life.  Shame be because I really liked this hose."
80563,"I have a cheap waffle towel I purchased at a local retailer that left marks on my car when it was used. This one is super soft, super absorbent, and an absolute dream to use. No marks - I'm very happy. About to order a few more so I can wash both cars without having to re-wash the towel in between uses."
80564,"These did not come with attaching cables as stated, but I made my own. The product works very well. No more insects."
80565,"Different plot from most science fiction shows. We love many space related science fiction shows, and enjoy Continuum for variety."
80566,What can I say. Quality product. Better than carrying block of wood. Love them and use them for 2 years now and use them everytime we go caping. Stack them out and simply drive up over them.  Have 3 sets now.
80567,this is one of the best series i have seen in a long time. the actors were ALL very good in this series. i would reccomend it to any adult to watch. it is spell binding.
80568,"To sum this series up,...Fairy Tales for grown ups! Fun, spooky, and highly entertaining. This series just keeps getting better. Highly recommend. Might be a bit scary for kids under 13."
80569,"I adore this feeder.  First off, the bright red color is striking and really adds to the look of my garden.  I wouldn't mind if it came in a variety of colors.  The quality construction stands out as soon as you open the box.  It is solidly made out of metal. It is easy to fill and hang.  The birds seem attracted to this feeder more than the others I have.  It makes for a nice feeder for black oil sunflower seeds.  I haven't noticed the birds having trouble getting the seeds out as others have stated.  I don't believe, however, that it will hold the 15-20 birds at once, as advertised. So far, I highly recommend this feeder."
80570,"Spray on wash is used after you wash the car and before you dry it. Just a little spray on wax makes drying so much easier and gives the car a nice smooth, just waxed feeling. Then the next time you go to wash you can see the results. Water beads up on the car like it has just been waxed. If you have never used Griot's products and you like taking care of your car, there are no better waxes and car care products on the market. Big believer in their products. I have a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee with original paint and we get compliments on it's shinny paint all the time. People want to buy it. Same with a 2001 Toyota pickup with original paint. The pickup shines uncontrollably.Griot's makes some great products."
80571,Come on now these are Ernie Ball strings what can I say that hasn't been said a 1000 time already there the best buy them
80572,"One thing with these white LED bulbs - they do give a sort of ""pinkish"" color to a red parking light (rear) on my 2005 TSX. But that is not the fault of the bulb - red lens and you're supposed to use red LED. But for my front door lights, they are excellent - very bright. So bright that I have to remind myself not to stare at these bulbs when opening the door - especially at night."
80573,"I have a nice Slime brand tire inflator http://www.amazon.com/Slime-40022-12-Volt-Digital-Inflator/dp/B002ZBWKAU/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1402797569&sr=1-1&keywords=slime+inflator (which I did not buy from Amazon, but highly recommend), but I had to pass it through various doors and windows to get all the tires.  With this I can get all four tires much more easily.  I had tried a coiled extension, but there was too much resistance in the wires.  The inflator needs a full 10 amps plus from the power plug.  I could tell the inflator wasn't quite as exuberant with this extension cord, but the loss was not significant enough to impact the function of the inflator."
80574,These will slip off and damage the clamp as well as skin your knuckles.Maybe if you were in a place with good access to the clamp it would work. I was despirate when I bought these and just wasted money
80575,"Good acting, good plots, good fun!  Both versions have been great fun to watch.  I would recommend them to anyone into the supernatural."
80576,Cover the plugs in these guys and your car will thank you.  I use them for spark plug applications without any issues. wouldn't install without it
80577,"MAYBE IT IS JUST ME WANTING THE PLOT TO MOVE FASTER. I find the hero and family,plus the western sailing full of possibilities, and hope the following episodes fulfilling .I am looking forward to it."
80578,"A good solid piece of equipment! It sounds as good as it looks and it is absolutely beautiful! The description listed slight wear marks on the back, but I had to really look hard to find it (one). It came as well packed as a brand-new guitar and looks like one!"
80579,"I'm an original fan, live a short distance from Southfork for the past 14 years and we original fans are the ones who buy & own all the DVDs. So they should take care to ensure we like the show. The dumbest thing they could do was to start the new show by having Bobby sell Southfork; ignore his son's heritage & opinions; and make stupid decisions without doing any research as if he was some dumb cowboy like Ray Krebbs with no business background. This story line was incredibly offensive to most original fans and alienated any loyalty to Bobby's character.  No one could feel any sympathy for him. What idiot wrote that? Duffy? Hagman?The new cast members all look alike & the writing will have to improve by 80%. Hopefully by finding some new writers who actually know the original series. For instance, Bobby did not inherit Southfork. Miss Ellie, via Clayton Farlow, signed over ownership of Southfork to Bobby in the last season and gave JR the control of Ewing Oil shares.  So John Ross could not overturn something that occurred before her Will which had nothing to do with Bobby owning Southfork.We all know the mineral rights for Southfork were always separate from the deed and used to trap Jeremy Wendell when dumb Ray sold his land. JR never would have forgotten that.Sue Ellen did not hide John Ross away at boarding schools... JR did. John Ross joined his mother because JR had become so consumed with James and destroying Cally over Weststar and Vanessa. So John Ross's comments were off base.The only 2 new characters with any charisma and character potential are Rebecca and Bobby's wife Ann. The rest of the new cast are duds and should be recast with new actors after they find new writers who actually watched the entire original series. Not some short attention span newbie who scanned through the episodes.Cliff's seething revenge attitude no longer makes sense. He owns Ewing oil and JR was a vegetable in a nursing home when the new series began. Cliff should be happy & gloating; not creating devious destruction plans and certainly would not hurt his nephew Christopher. Cliff also never wanted Southfork. That was miss Ellie's home, not oil well's that Jock stole from Digger. The only person Cliff should be angry at and seeking revenge upon is Afton who cruelly and illegally kept his daughter from seeing or knowing him. Or angry at JR; if & when he tries to take back Ewing Oil.Someone also needs to convince Hagman that those ridiculous eyebrows are not his trademark. They make him look like some Alzheimer geezer who is incapable of personal grooming. The eyebrows are nasty.Duffy and Hagman also need to do better with the characters of Lucy and Ray. Those fleeting cameos were an insult to the actors and fans. They were both core characters who battled JR. We need to see more of them but without repeats of old mistakes as if they never learned their lessons. They should be stronger and smarter now but angry with Bobby for the selling Southfork fiasco.Also, let us not forget about Lucas - Bobby's natural son, as well as James and Cally's baby who were both Jr's natural born offspring. They each have claims on the Ewing legacy.Focusing the later episodes of the original series on Bobby & JR with an endless parade of Bimbo's for their off~set pleasure is what destroyed Dallas the first time and permanently chased away Victoria Principal. Just look at the ratings after Pam and then even more so when Sue Ellen left and the ratings plummeted. Hagman & Duffy & the producer Katzman were so blinded by the procession of Bimbo's, they couldn't see their decisions were the problem.Dallas was not a male fan dominated series. Vast numbers of women watched it for the glamour & power & interactions of the cast. (Glamour: as in jewels, clothes, furs, money... not bimbo's and sex). Especially the interactions of Sue Ellen & Pam fighting back to hold their own. They ruined Pam by making her run away and whine instead of sticking by Bobby & fighting for their marriage. Sue Ellen was at her best when she was successful and not rolling in the gutter. The bimbo's were shallow and offensive to both male and female fans. Any viewers who need an endless parade of swimsuit models to keep their interest - are not watching Prime time soap operas. They are watching the X rated channels or out cruising street corners and bars.The producers should have a little common sense this time and don't depend on those hack Nielson ratings and opinions which never contact the actual audience and caused cancellations of wildly popular shows that has enraged fans for decades. Most of the fans and cast have died waiting for a new Dallas and the original Dallas DVD sets which took forever to complete; while some anarchistic Xgen tried to create a mockery comedy to get revenge on their parents generation. Thanks to Travolta for refusing to go along with it.Let us hope they learn from their mistakes this time before it is too late. This show can be a success again if they don't waste this second chance which has taken far too long."
80580,"I first heard about headlamp restoration kits from a mechanic who offered to make my old headlights look like new while I wait. I must admit I was skeptical and declined the service. Then I heard about this product again and bought a competing kit to restore the headlamps on a car I was selling. It made the headlamps look like new! I had no idea that the yellowing and fogginess of older headlamps is caused by road grime, bugs, grit, wind, and overall aging of the top layer of plastic.I sold that car to the first person to see it and from then on was sold on headlamp restoration. It actually drives me crazy to see yellow headlights on the various cars in parking lots. I'm basically a headlamp restoration evangelist.I tried this kit and it worked just as well as the other kit but took longer since you do everything by hand. If you have a cordless drill, there are some more expensive kits that come with an attachment to install on your drill to make the sanding go faster.I have one more car to sell, so I restored the headlights a bit more since their last treatment two years ago and they are sparkly and bright again.I also believe that even if you are not into vehicle vanity that these make your car safer on the road because your headlamps work better."
80581,"I thought this pilot was just okay.  The characters and story were interesting, but I didn't really like the musical aspect of the show.  It's creative but I am not sure I would watch more."
80582,I chose to use the K&N filter because of the quality and the name.  I use other K&N products on my truck.
80583,"It's a little harder to open than other capos I've used, but it works perfectly once you get used to the toughness of it. It's not cheap and flimsy, though! I don't see this one wearing down anytime soon! Now stop reading this review and buy this capo! You wont regret it!"
80584,"I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also, there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us, it&#8217;s easy to assemble, it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go."
80585,"Great cast, great concept, great long series you can immerse yourself in.  Interesting how some of the actors don't look nearly so good in other projects.Ending of series takes easy way out."
80586,"The Anco wiper blade I ordered installed easily on my car's passenger side and works well.  It is streak free and there is no clattering or noise.  I don't know what the durability of this blade will be so I left off a star for now, I will update a few months from now.  The package came with several adaptors for various applications but before ordering, make sure the blade will fit your vehicle.  This is easy to do with Amazon's garage app that stores your vehicle to match it with parts that fit."
80587,Will not buy again. Tooo small of amount and marginal performance.
80588,"I'm used to the old 70's and 80's speakers that I've had on my stereo since that time.  I read the reviews about what people said about hearing things they never had before.  I was blown away.  They are all correct, get them setup right and hear all the things your music has been missing (I listen all the time with different headphones, not the same!).  The way the music was separated so well, I swear it sounded like the vocals were coming from right in front of me and the guitars were on each side of the vocals.  I had to dig up all kinds of music to test them out.  I don't know what kind of bass people are wanting out of these but when I use them to watch movies, listen to music, etc... They have lots of punch, even when I play my guitar through them (POD HD PRO)."
80589,"I didn't care for the cast or the direction the series seemed to be going. The wife and I didn't care to watch it, and we like shows like parenthood etc."
80590,"We have a rental house, wanted something small and easy to use for just cleaning off the driveway, patios, and even the garage.  This little guys is light, convenient, not too loud, and has just enough power to clean up what we have to clean.  Not sure I would try to use it to blow the entire yard for all the fall leaves, but that wasn't what I needed it for.  Perfect addition to my garage."
80591,I love watching this show it is very interesting and I learn something about keeping safe. I love shows like this
80592,"After our gas grill had to be retired, we decided to get a charcoal grill.  Weber has a reputation for having a solid product that will last for many years, and I have no doubt that we'll be using this for a long time.  But the legs seem to be made out of somewhat cheaper material than what we had when I was younger. Think I'll be getting the cover to protect it over the winter.This particular model doesn't have the one-touch ash catcher and after using this a few times, I'm kind of sorry we didn't go with that particular model.One person can put it together without help, athough it can be a struggle for a bit.Grilling?  Well that's exactly like you'd expect although I miss having a grated shelf to keep some items a little further from the charcoal.  That just requires a difference in how you mound the briskets."
80593,The second season is even better than the first. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. I hope season three is as good as the first two.
80594,Wish it was back.  Don't know why they always cancel the good shows. Get rid of all those reality shows and bring back real tv.Awesome show!
80595,"buy this at a local store!  Highly recommend not having it shipped to you.  The can I rec'd was bulging at the end from the heat even though it was well packaged.  Can says avoid heat, undue pressure..can may burst.  Sure the post office loves this kind of stuff being shipped... The tire shine worked good for me even though I was afraid to shake the can too much!  The nozzle has low/med/high settings for the spray.  I used the low and pretty carefully went around the tire a couple times.  Directions say not to get on tread.  Also not for use on bike as it will make it slippery.  Tires shine like they are wet looking..it's nice looking!"
80596,"I watched it when it was shown on TV but was not that excited at first. As the episodes continued I became more involved wondering what had occurred and what was the driving force behind the disappearance of the 63s. Then the network pulled the plug and left us all hanging. Still. it is a good show to watch. Because of this, I have become a fan of Jorge Garcia and look forward to his appearances on Hawaii 50."
80597,"I just installed these on my Chibson LP from overseas. I had to rout out the holes a bit and make them ever so slightly larger.. I took a slightly larger drill bit and turned it backwards, not forwards, by hand slowly, until it was perfect. I also put some blue masking tape on the headstock just in case I slipped. Took me about 1.5 hours.The ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance. Really close, but they were terrible in operation. I have no problems spending the 50 on these to improve the guitar. Haven't played them yet, but all the reviews were good, so here goes.....Update:  Played for a couple hours. First thing I notice is that they are geared lower than the old Chibsons and the other tuners on my other guitars.. You tune it a full turn, and the tune moves up slightly. Which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment.This fixed the Chibson tuning issue. I'll order another set for my other Chibson.Also, I have two Epiphones. I believe these are nicer than the Epi's.So I bought based solely on the reviews here. I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I am pretty impressed. good replacement for ""iffy"" tuners. They worked for me..."
80598,"While at times it seems the pace drags a little bit, overall it was an enjoyable movie with big doses of humanity. Adrien Brody has such a unique look that only certain movies fit his mode of acting, and we think with this movie he finds a perfect fit. Audio and Video quality was more than acceptable, and since it was absolutely free for those with the prime membership, I strongly recommend taking the time to watch this one. 4 Stars."
80599,"This is a very well built, heavy duty mole trap.  It is easy to set and the concept is a good one.  We have not caught a mole yet but are very close.  My husband set the trap right over the mole tunnel as instructed.  He said he thought it might work a little better if it were a tad wider.  The mole ran into the post part of the trap that is underground and went to the left of it instead of in between...LOL!  He got lucky that time!  I am sure this trap will catch the moles that we have because the principle of the trap is very sound.  I like the fact that the sharp parts are under ground where pets and children are not at risk of the trap.  The spring is also very heavy duty, with a lot of power and durability.8-15-2013Just wanted to add that this product has done its job very well!  We did get the mole and it works well!"
80600,"I acquired this recently, I did not need another strat style, or copy of, but it's white....just gotta love that vibe? Anyhow lots of reviews justifiably good, here's a few add ons in case... It's routed hsh under the hood but looks tight.. Think it's bucker size upgradable; top and bottom didn't measure, I like single coils...the white is a poly finish (love poly durable and crack/fade resist) and exquisite nicely done, alder body but it's hefty alder, like 8lb or so. Not so keen on headstock shape but the neck is nice, too nice to change like I was thinking till I got it... Nice quality control on these, really smooth rosewood board with med-jumbo (that's what I call anyway) frets good fretting. Standard hardware indicative of price but decent and well installed, no missed screw holes etc. Was set up with standard action etc, out of box was clean set up no buzz or uneven saddle stuff etc. great fit and finish, best I can tell its a standard f type plate, if interested looks to be easy changer.Overall it's a solid piece, assembled well, for me the body and neck is what seals the deal, better then most out there this range... It is alder and hefty, but durable. I look to change most hardware in time so won't comment on that, what's there... is installed well...2 things I forgot tuners wanna say 15:1? 10mm standard import style... Seem good, not legendary and tremelo/whammy standard zinc block (there's the must upgrade part...) it's standard 10.5 string space import, I got one pet peave; it's steel or brass blocks... A shame all these guitars nowadays with the zinc thin low sustain blocks, my advice get a fender mim standard lefty trem, the whole thing with steel saddles and all maybe 50$ best money ever spent... I can't afford the gotoh or Callahan stuff, On this a standard mim import space fender with steel block and saddles is easy direct replacement and with the hefty alder you'll get tons of sustain and tone and keep tuned way better. Also the neck I say nice but I mean it's nicer than most in the shape, it's slightly chunky c shape? Not baseball bat chunky but you feel it on frets 1-3 it's beefier? I have avg. size hands, I find it's a good fit.In all... If your looking in this price range it's nice, and upgradable as you can or learn more."
80601,"Quick to install, and they look good.Had a good idea what I was getting, and the reality is better.The gray color is darker than pix (which is good, matches the interior almost perfectly).The panel design is more intricate than pictured, and more attractive.Were the fit just a *little* better, they would look like factory covers. But I'm satisfied.They protect the seat from sun and spills, and that's all I need.Not sure how long they'll hold up (give me a year, and I won't beef) and there were a couple minor pulls in the fabric."
80602,"The Rugged Ridge side A-pillar switch pod will work with this switch.  Rugged Ridge makes similar switches but I like the shape of these better.  The directions that come with the switch are clear and so they are easy to connect.  The power for the lamp light comes from the wire going to the relay.  There is also one terminal on the back that needs to go to a ground connection. So there are three terminals on the back; Power In, Power Out, Lamp ground.  The terminals are standard size and easy to connect terminals to.  You will have to get your own terminals and wire; there is no wiring harness for the switches.The plastic for these switches seems a little light weight but other reviewers have indicated no long-term problems."
80603,"The landmark season of South Park saw Matt Stone and Trey Parker's animated series back on top thanks to some scathing, satirical moments and just plain animated lunacy.  It also saw the departure of Isaac Hayes, the voice of Chef, who departed after the previous season's lampooning of scientology and Tom Cruise.  His departure is spoofed in the opening ""Return of Chef"" which uses archive sounds of Hayes' voice as Chef returns to South Park brainwashed by the Super Adventure Club, and seeling to ""re-connect"" with children.  Things only get better as Kyle's dad buys a hybrid car in ""Smug Alert!"", Al Gore seeks attention from anyone with ""Manbearpig"", Cartman's mom turns to the Dog Whisperer in ""Tsst!"", Satan has a killer Halloween party in ""Hell on Earth 2006"", and Cartman seeks to freeze himself in anticipation for the release of the Nintendo Wii in ""Go God Go"".  The best moments of the season however came with the two part ""Cartoon Wars"" which hilariously lampooned Family Guy, and it makes sense in a way you've never imagined.  ""Make Love, Not Warcraft"" satires the players of the incredibly popular online RPG, and ""Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy"" finds little Ike having an illicit affair.  The only downpoint of the season is the closing ""Stanley's Cup"" which finds Stan coaching a terrible pee-wee hockey team, for no apparent reason.  This episode just isn't funny, at all.  Despite that though, every other episode here in the tenth season is a winner, and ten years and still going strong, South Park proves that these kids are quite alright."
80604,"I laoved this crazy actress in Big Love, she has a commending stare, but in this she is far more believable. It's a terrific story and builds to a climax nicely."
80605,"My grandson loves to watch Caillou, I enjoy watching and though I have read several blogs that parents do not like Caillou as they may say he is a cry baby or he never grows hair...well, kids are like that and my daughter didn't get hair until she was 2 years old!  Small children don't see he doesn't have hair...but the notice how difficult he can be as are all children so it turns out that they see how they behave and my grandson and I talk about that...he is doing better!  Thumbs up Caillou!"
80606,"Not being a fan of classical music, I was surprised that I enjoyed this fast paced look at the world of the modern symphony. Laced with sex, vitriolic personalities and lots of alcohol it was certainly the best of the Amazon pilots that I watched this year. I am eager to follow the exploits of the oboist, cellist and conductor through the coming season! I pray the powers that be are wise enough to select it for production/presentation."
80607,"If you want to help your cooling system be more efficent,Then this product is what you need. 1oz per quart of cooling system . And watch the temp drop. Must have for better cooling."
80608,"I used it combined with the 5 way connector to reach a second vehicle from my battery charger, and it works just great. I am now maintaining two batteries with one charger and both are easily disconnected or connected with these simple plugs.  I love it."
80609,I loved the show when it was on TV and will continue to watch the reruns. This however was NOT 'The Dead Files Revisited' as your picture shows. A follow up on the previous shows would have been nice to fine out if the clients followed through with the advice given.
80610,I enjoy watching this series and can only hope the lovers get together.
80611,"If you loved The Vicious Brothers and their film ""Grave Encounters,"" they're hoping you'll flock to buy the next chapter of their horror saga creatively titled ""Grave Encounters 2.""  Utilizing the increasingly popular ""found footage"" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, ""Grave Encounters"" was a reasonably effective (if not spectacularly original) entry into the horror arena.  It does seem that every low budget scary movie of late thinks that this is the go-to genre of filmmaking, so it's becoming more difficult to distinguish inventive works from the overcrowded pack.  This sequel employs the same device to carry out the story.  And it is just so tired already!  But as long as the movie has something fresh to offer, found footage can still make for a thrilling visceral experience.  I may not have hated ""Grave Encounters 2"" as much as some--but after a reasonably promising set-up, the film seemed to implode on itself with a lunatic (and ill conceived) final act.The movie takes place roughly two years after the events of the first movie.  A film student (Richard Harmon) is obsessed with the footage of the first film and decides to see if the events depicted were real or not.  As any remarkably sane person would do, he assembles some friends to break into the psychiatric hospital represented two years prior.  Even if everything is real (which he believes), his knowledge of the place and its monsters should provide plenty of clues for survival.  There isn't much more to tell without revealing spoilers.  I'll just say that the introduction (which takes a VERY LONG time) is handled well enough, but a major twist in the hospital kind of derails the franchise.  Very little makes sense after this revelation and the film just gets loopier by the second, and not in a particularly good way.I liked that there is a distinct connection to the first film. Here, The Vicious Brothers made a smart decision.  This movie presupposes that you've seen the original.  Although you can certainly watch this as a stand alone, the finale will lose some of its impact.  But maybe that's a good thing as I really thought that this was the weakest point in the series so far.  If you remember the stylistic differences between ""Blair Witch"" and its abysmal sequel, some of the same mistakes were made here.  It's almost too meta, too referential to the original and so it loses a unique voice of its own.  And with the choices made in the conclusion, it defies the logic of the first picture and this is always something that irritates me.  KGHarris, 3/13."
80612,The lead is a depressed bore and the other characters are stiff and cliche. The LA setting is done well but that is about it
80613,"Got it to replace the Air Filter on my Mitsubishi Evolution X. After a little research came across people saying this one would have the same same size.Well, it DOES. And is EXACTLY the same as the OEM Mitsubishi uses it but for 1/2 the price! Since FRAM is a very well-known brand for any kind of filters, this is the way to go! I wouldn't be suspect if someday people tell me that this IS the OEM, but without the Mitsubishi logo on it.Cleans well the air and since i'm a user of contact lens, any dust gets my eyes red. After changing, my eyes are much better."
80614,"We happened upon this show by chance... it was recommended based on another show my daughter was watching. So, my 5-yr-old daughter likes it, and my 2-yr-old son goes CRAZY over it. He starts jumping up and down when we say Pocoyo. :)  As for the content, it's divided up into several mini episodes, so it's easy to stop in the middle without too much kiddo-complaint. It attempts to teach some mild lessons, but it's mostly cute, lively young child entertainment."
80615,I only watched two episode of this series.  It isn't a story type of show but just a lot of scattered things happening.  Someone may enjoy the shows but I would personally not recommend it to anyone.
80616,"When I received my Toro 20360 e-Cycler I could not wait to charge it up and try it out.  After having the unit charge for about 18 hours I was disappointed it would not start.  I re-read the instructions and tried resetting the circuit breaker and left it charging for another day and I still could not get it to start.  I called the Toro automated customer service and it directed me to contact a local authorized Toro dealer.  Luckily for me, we have one close by.  I dropped the unit off with a copy of my packing slip and they informed me it would be a few days.  Once I received the phone call to pick up my mower I was told the problem was due to a wire not being connected inside the motor, this probably happened during assembly at the plant.  It was an easy fix for them, all they had to do was plug it in.  I was also told that it was nothing I would of been able to fix on my own since I would of needed a special tool to open the motor compartment. They were even nice enough to register the mower on my behalf in case there are any more warranty claims in the future. The mower comes with a two-year full warranty.I finally get to try out our new mower.  I inserted the key, pulled up on the red lever and it started running beautifully.  It is so quiet when it runs.  No fumes or smoke for me to gag on.  It mulches the grass in a fine grade.  The bag is easy to empty and remove if you don't want use it.  All four wheels are adjustable for your preference in grass height.The only negative things I can say is that the mower does not have any kind of LED status for how much charge is left.  On the average I got about 45 minutes of use on one charge.  There is a status light on the AC plug when charging the unit -- red it's charging, green the charge is complete.  I also was somewhat shock on how heavy the mower is.  We have 2 acres of land, so we use a riding mower for most of the yard except the detailing and trimming around trees and walkways. We have some steep inclines and it was hard on my muscles pushing the mower up hill, it is quite heavy.  Too bad it is not self propelling.Other than the two things I mentioned above, I am extremely please with the even level cutting power and performance of the Toro 20360 e-Cycler.  Emissions free and powerful."
80617,"Classic design.  I remember these from 35 years ago in high school band.  They haven't changed much, don't fix it if it's not broken."
80618,"This movie transcends relationship cliches and has the bravery to stay focused on it's 3 characters without any trite or whimsical artificial plot twists.  This guy is in a rut and assumes the erratic romance which is more difficult to attain must be valuable. Conversely, the calm stable romance he doesn't quite trust.  All 3 characters are headed for some challenges regardless of their choices."
80619,"I really found these guys to be humorous, especially when they both used to be on MAD TV. This sketch comedy, every episode, makes me laugh. I've watch a couple of the sketches two or three times over because it makes me laugh. It's worth it."
80620,"This singer has an interesting background, but her music doesn't do much for me. Thought it might be a good doc;but it's really a concert. So if a fan, you will like it."
80621,"Ike Oden, DVD Verdict --The scenarios for each episode are more or less your typical sitcom fare: the boys scheme to pass a drug test, the boys lie to some girls in order to get dates, the boys spend a night locked in their office, etc. Workaholics knows this well-worn territory intimately and filters it through a haze of drugs, pop culture obsession, and frat boy perversion. Scatology, substance abuse and sexual deviance drive Workaholics' creative engine not as gratuitous gross-out humor but as serious philosophical and personal issues for our protagonists. Pop culture is approached with a similarly solemn face, meaning boys don't reference Nickelodeon's Double Dare, Dateline's ""To Catch A Predator"" and The Insane Clown Posse as one-off jokes, but as major story points within episodes.None of these innovations would coalesce if actors/creators Anderson, DeVine, and Holm didn't have such spectacular comedic chemistry with one another. The trio created the show after accumulating years of improv and viral video experience together, making their ""best friend"" interplay organic and believable. Each represents a different archetype of buddy comedies--Holm is the responsible one, Anderson is the quirky guy, and DeVine is the clueless leader. With the meta use of their own names and storylines culled from real life experiences, the guys are play stylized versions of themselves (comparable to Larry David's work in Curb Your Enthusiasm) giving the show a naturally spontaneous feel that's refreshing in a sitcom.This meta premise also adds extra dimensions to the characters, letting the performers take their characters down roads that border skirt the lines of insanity and narcissism without freeing the characters of conscious and empathy. They're bros, after all, and always rely on the bond their friendship to claw their way out of whatever ridiculous problem they face each episode. Unlike the characters populating the similarly anarchic It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, it's hard not to sympathize with stoners like Blake, Adam, and Anders. They love each other, and we love them for it.Great praise must also be showered upon the show's writing. Dialogue consistently crackles with pseudo hip-hop slang and some of the most creative profanity ever realized on the small screen. Not only that, but the show's ability to consistently subvert audience expectations without relying on gimmicks or false plot twists deserves a rousing applause. Though their numbers are too large to list here, accolades must be given to the writing staff and showrunners of Workaholics as some of the freshest comedy writing on television.As if I couldn't recommend Workaholics enough, Comedy Central comes through with a DVD absolutely stacked with content.The technical specs check out solidly. The show is shot on a fairly small budget, so the somewhat fuzzy 1.78.1 transfer won't blow minds, but proves serviceable for a shot-on-digital show about workaday potheads. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track fares a little better, boasting very clear dialogue and a thumping hip-hop theme that you'll never tire of hearing.The extras that are where Workaholics: Season One really shine. Included in the set is cast interviews, deleted/alternate scenes, Workaholics digital originals, a live Workaholics sketch (as performed at Bonnaroo), outtakes, and (fittingly inebriated) audio commentaries for each episode. Rather than pick apart each extra bit-by-bit and step on the jokes, I will only say every supplement sampled here made me laugh as hard as the show itself. If the bonus material is to be trusted, the Workaholics crew are just as hilarious outside the show as they are on it. For fans, the extras are a veritable feast of funny that spans several hours beyond the episodes featured.-Full review at dvdverdict.com"
80622,"This show has one interesting character. The rest are freaking boring, which is a shame because the premise is pretty cool. Why cast such uninteresting actors? And why are the characters so poorly written? The plot line is quality work, but for what is basically supposed to be a police procedural the &#34;cops&#34; spend half of every episode complaining, and the other half fighting and sulking. The  lead cop brings her ex onto the team, who sits through most of the pilot. (Sulking.) Then in a later episode they have a fight about her keeping things from him and for the rest of that episode he sulks and ignores her calls.(The calls of the lead investigator during a case involving the possible murder of a woman.) Because he is her ex she does not have him removed from the team, but tries to make up. So very irritating. I keep wanting to shout at the characters to grow the f up."
80623,Zombie shows just don't get any better than The Walking Dead! Season 4 is packed with so many surprises at every turn. This is an intense season of WD.
80624,"I love this tire shine, I use it every time I clean the cars. Spray it on, let it set and wipe off the excess. I do not use this as a spray and go or else it will leave a greasy film down the side of the car."
80625,"This series is truly heartbreaking to watch. The hell the addicts and their families endure, is a real human tragedy."
80626,"I was in need of an Air Compressor but I did not want to get one that was huge.  This little guy is pretty small and does the job!  You set your PSI, plug it in and hook up to whatever needs air.  The Air Compressor will stop automatically once it reaches the preset PSI.  It is awesom if it ever breaks down I will be picking up another!"
80627,"Episode 1, 2 and 3 were pretty depressing. It seemed everyone's life was falling apart. The era references were perfect, though, from the hippy commune to the attitude of the young people, Don's children in particular. The clothes were spot on as were the living spaces. We were ready to pack it in, concluding it was too much of a downer, but continued to the end. I am so happy we did. I thought the ending was perfect, it wrapped up all the years. Now when I think of the Mad Men series there is a positive vibe."
80628,"I really like theseOuddy Heat Resistant Meat Clawsfor getting meats and foods out of myMasterbuilt Electric Smoker.  The claws feature long teeth that dig into the meat to give me a good strong grip, when removing it from the smoker.  Whole chickens, prime rib, Boston butt, brisket; these claws allow me to feel confident getting my food out of the cooker and that is just amazing.  Really satisfied with theOuddy Heat Resistant Meat Claws.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]"
80629,"This series is riveting. If you watch one episode, you will not want to stop, You WILL want to go directly to the next. I highly recommend it."
80630,This was a great show. Had awesome &#34;lost&#34; type potential with the built-in plots of each of the missing inmates. Sad they cancelled it as we were looking forward to this season.
80631,"This item will help keep your battery on full charge,and ready to go all the time, when used properly. Use in conjunction with the extender cord,(will let you park farther from the wall plug)."
80632,"Does Darken Black Plastic but it does not last like the Meguiar's Trim Spray they used to have. If you use this, use some F-21 protectant spay on the surface first (made by Turtle Wax Company). The shine and darkening of black plastic will be a lot better and last's a lot longer."
80633,well what can I say about kneeling mats other than I really like it. Right size and glad I was able to find this color. I use it all the time and it looks like it will last me a long time. Others I've bought before only lasted a year before falling apart. So far so good.
80634,A good show and interesting solutions to preparing unusual items of food.  It would be even better if they all left their personalities at the door.
80635,"My whole family, young and old, like this program.  It's just good clean fun.  One of the few programs that my husband and our grandson can sit and watch together."
80636,"They carry this thing as far as it can be carried.  You could write the screenplay in 10 minutes, perhaps struggling a bit to hold back on the sex scenes so that you can keep your lead actors.  Ie, nothing new here.  Just a vehicle for 2 of my favorite actresses."
80637,"The acting in this was poor and the quality of the film was poor. It would stop and start several times. This is a movie back from the early 70,S Lots of T&A but you can go to american Pie for that!"
80638,"I have been doing battle for my garden with the elements and pests for the past 15 years.  I have tried just about everything, excepting pesticide, and I will not resort to that.  Since I built raised beds and routinely add compost, the water problem has been tempered somewhat. My biggest problem the past few years has been pests, of the larger variety.  i have fenced my yard, fenced my garden and even put fencing (hicken wire or hardware cloth) around individual plants.  It's a lot of work and expense and does not always work (animals dig)!last year i tried an earlier version of the Havahart spray away and while I thought it was a great idea, I was not very impressed with it's performance.  The primary issue was power.  It stopped working after a few days of rain and the spray did not reach as far as the infra-red detection.  The new model seems to have solved that problem with a better battery which is precharged so that it may be used right out of the box.  I have only had the new one out for a little while but can already see the improvement.  It is an overcast, rainy day and it is working nonetheless!  Besides that, it does seem to spray to the set range (that is the spray reaches as far as you have the detection sensitivity set).  My complaint with the older model was that it can detect movement at 35 feet, but the spray only reached 5 feet!I know from years of studying behavioral psychology that you get the best results when there is 100% certainty.  With something like this in the garden, an intruder will be sprayed every time it enters and should rapidly learn to stay away.I like that it is safe to people , pets and wildlife (as well as plants).  The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that I have some withholds based on my experience with the older model.  If my garden survives this season without my having to fence every plant or sleep outside, I will come back and rerate.  Thus far I am mor impressed with this model than the old one.  They do seem to have the kinks worked out.  Now if I can only find something which is safe and effective against giant snails we'll be in business (I may have to keep those little fences up... but at least they do not dig ;)-----------------------------------------------------------updated 6/22/2013I am updating this review after having had it in place for a few months.  It does work a good deal better than the prior model.  One of the complaints i had with the old model was that it could dretect at a distance of 15-20 feet but the spray was only 3 feet (not very effective for something 15 feet away).  This model has a longer range, and is somewhat bvetter matched to the detection.I still believe it could use some twesaks and may not be the thing for everyone (it very much depending on the type of pest).  There isa limited spanb to the detection and spray.  That is, it will only detect pests coming from one direction (and they do not always do that ;)  The spray is also at a height of about 3-4 feet, so if you have small pests it would not work very well (for example I do not imagine it would be much heklp to people who have issues with rabbits or gophers).In short it is working better than the last, and my garden has only been attacked once since I put this out, BUT I think it was out of water then.  That said, for me, it is helping some and I find it to be a big imporvement over the older model."
80639,I've watched all of the Foyle series and have become a true fan of all the characters. The timeframe of WW II and the civil problems faced by the English are very interesting.
80640,This is perfect to keep my battery charged in my dual battery truck that is used seldomit took over 8 hours to load the batteries as I expected not bad for a 1.25a charger
80641,"I have another Fiskars pruner and this is just as well made. It should last for a long while with some care (do clean, dry, and oil the blades after each use especially if you won't reuse for a while). I'm only concerned about the cork handles. I'm afraid that they'll get soggy and dirty if using them in moist conditions or might even crack and break but only time will tell. My other Fiskars pruner has plastic-covered handles and just feels more durable."
80642,"This hummingbird feeder looks like a beautiful piece of Yard Art.  In the morning light the heavy glass bottle glows and the brushed copper base shimmers.  The little copper flowers are also awesome, so intricate and detailed.The only thing that worries me is the absence of hummingbirds.  I do have a few hummingbirds in my yard, but I haven't seen one visit the feeder.  I'm worried that the little copper flowers are not bright enough, and there is not enough contrast between the color of the flower and the color of the base.I will watch it for a few weeks and see what happens.  If no hummingbirds visit I may try painting the flower a brighter color.But even if no hummingbirds visit the feeder, it still looks beautiful in the yard."
80643,my kids loved it
80644,"Nothing special about this feeder. As the illustration shows, it is a metal tube with two plastic windows. The feeder arrived without any instructions although none were really needed. The cap was loose on arrival so it was easy to fill the tube with seed. The cap is somewhat awkward to put into place because unless you have it exactly even with the top of the tube it will resist efforts to push it down into place. Once you get the top pushed down completely you will have quite a challenge to remove it for restocking the seed.There is nothing squirrel proof about this feeder. You will need to hang it from a squirrel proof pole to keep the squirrels away. If you hang it from a tree branch, for example, the squirrels will thank you as they gobble up the seed.China dropped the ball when they came up with this feeder. There are far better feeders available including some that are made in China. This one is not recommended."
80645,This is the first wax I've used on my car and it is real easy to apply and leaves a great coat of protection. This wax also smells amazing!
80646,"This penetrating solvent is easy to use and seems to work well.  I've used it to free up several rusted up bolts and such and, after giving it time to work, it has worked every time, so far.  :-)"
80647,"We were surprised by this series.  Liked the mystery of what &#34;The Event&#34; will turn out to be.  We were also very surprised that the series was not renewed for another season.  I hope that this idea will be revisited in the future and perhaps a return to the idea with a fresh series, after &#34;The Event&#34; happened."
80648,I enjoyed all three seasons of this show very much.  It is about an Earth that has largely been taken over by aliens but there is a human resistance in places.  Good writing and good acting.
80649,Purchased two of these for front and back lawns.  Sprinkler goes on like clockwork early each a.m..So convenient not having to turn units on and off.  Well made.
80650,"I'm not a performing musician, so I actually use this on my guitar stand to keep a variety of picks close at hand.  Holds everything from a .5mm nylon pick to a 3.1mm rubber pick, and I have yet to see one fall out.  Simple solution to a simple problem."
80651,"Most of the other reviews have pretty much covered just about everything I would say however I still want to say I love this tool. Not being someone who has had a lot of theory under my belt, it's been useful to help me learn the letters of keys. Slowly I am making progress at memorizing key signatures so that I know where I am on the fretboard & where I can go from there. I use it by putting it on my music stand, dialing in the key I want, turn on the drum machine & simply play the chords in that key to the beat. Then when I want to practice the relevant scales of the key, I simply look at the letters and count the fingering for the corresponding note. It's that easy.I will say that I do agree that the instructions are a wee bit too thin for my taste but music notation & theory is not a subject that the average player is adept with. Most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned. To really grasp it, one simply has to plod along actually performing the exercises repeatedly. But with rote repetition, eventually comes that ""Eureka!"" moment from time to time & more falls into place.Unlike some others, I'm not one to lug something this around in my gig bag. Who really is going to set & study material like this prior to a gig? That's what you do at home and it's called 'Practice' for a reason.I give this 5 out of 5 stars because it really is a fantastic learning tool & is relatively simple to use as long as you have some inkling of music theory. If not, you may want to take some lessons & then use this as a study guide along with your regular lessons."
80652,"If you like original horror that has a vicious streak, then you're going to love V/H/S/2!  I wasn't sure what to expect before I watched this film; a couple of friends had seen it and told me it was really good.  But they never got into specifics, saying it was something you had to see to appreciate.  And man, I'm glad I did!  V/H/S/2 is a hell of a film, and I'm glad I gave it a shot!You can't think of this as a traditional horror film.  This is actually something new.  It is a compilation of short films, all shot from a first-person perspective, that all blend in with the main storyline.  But the shorts are not related.  In fact, it is the diversity of the shorts that make this film so enthralling.As I mentioned, each short film in V/H/S/2 is shot from the first-person perspective, so in a sense these are found-footage styled pieces.  But they are so much more as well.  Each film has its own style and voice, which allows you to switch gears when each film ends; this is not a negative, but in fact a good thing.  The different tones set a unique mood for each film...and as a result, the audience is taken on a roller-coaster ride of terror and fun.For example, one of the segments is called ""A Ride in the Park"".  In this piece, a mountain-biker mounts a GoPro camera on his helmet and sets off for a ride on a trail.  But things quickly go downhill when he stumbles across a group of shambling zombies.  I will not disclose the rest of the short, but it is excellent and one of my favorites.I particularly like how all the short films are secondary to the main plot-line.  However, if I were forced to find a fault with V/H/S/2, it would have to be that not much is explained in regard to the primary story.  It is tense and suspenseful, but I didn't know much about what was going on throughout it.  Perhaps this because I have yet to watch the first V/H/S...if so, I will have to remedy that very soon.V/H/S/2 is a definite win for me, however, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  There is some truly terrifying stuff in this film, so be ready.  But I can definitely see myself watching this one through a couple more times, just to see what I missed the first time around.  Give this one a look, if you can."
80653,"LAST RESORT looks good on paper - a different storyline than the now dreary cop shows that keep morphing with new titles each season: Andre Braugher and Scott Speedman have certainly paid their dues and are very ready to be the leads in a series. Using a submarine as the base at first seems solid in concept (claustrophobic but in a way that allows it to be a microcosm of human behavior), but that sub can't stay submerged long enough. The story blisters into some flashbacks, pops open the lid of Washington DC in a not too unfamiliar manner (these days), and adds a very rapid new bas on a tropical islands where it seems that the crew plan to establish a new world, having been the victim of misguided US military tactics and potential in a nuclear war with Pakistan.The cast includes some female characters who seem to have a potential for becoming important figures in the story - the supporting cast includes Daisy Betts, Camille De Pazzis, Dichen Lachman, Daniel Lissing, Sahr Ngaujah, Autumn Reeser, Jessy Schram, Robert Patrick, Matt Gerald, Omid Abtahi, Max Adler, David Rees Snell, Michael Ng, Jessica Camacho, Will Rothhaar, Bruce Davison, Daniel Bess, Jodi Jarvis - but the show falls apart in the midst of all the commercial breaks that for once seem more interesting than the series itself. It all feels a bit silly.  Grady Harp, September 12"
80654,"When I saw this offered, I jumped on it.  So far the deer had eaten all my lily's, including my day lily's and were beginning to start on my tiger lily's.  Add in the echinacea and my beautiful garden was almost gone.  As soon as this arrived, I began spraying.Assembly of the unit was easy.  Batteries were already installed, so it was simply a matter of unscrewing the cap and placing the siphon hose in the canister and tightening the lid.  Unfortunately, the batteries were dead.  So a run to the store for new batteries.  Try again.  The sprayer began spraying when depressing the trigger button.  (Batteries should be packaged separately so they don't run down, me thinks)Sprayed the flowers and the area around them.  Given the smell of this stuff, I was sure it would work.  (Yes you can smell it and it is vile).  One caution, don't spray on a windy day if you have to stand downwind of the sprayer.  I could feel the hot pepper working in my nose and mouth.Went inside and waited to see what would happen over night - would the deer be back?In a word, yes.  From the amount of deer dung (copious amounts) on the ground around my flower beds, it was more like a herd instead of one or two.  As I walked closer, two rabbits jumped from the  echinacea and hopped across the yard.  All the day lily blossoms were gone, as were the heads of my tiger lily's.Does this stuff work?  In a word, no.  Maybe it's just the wild game around my place, but it seemed to me that Deer Off was more like a salad dressing attracting the animals instead of deterring them."
80655,"I ordered the polyweb strings on the advice of some friends.  They didn't care at all for nanowebs which are widely available, but swore by the quality of the polywebs.  By some sort of mixup I got nanowebs by mistake.  I requested a return to get the proper item, and the seller offered to send me the polywebs and told me to keep the nanowebs for the trouble.  I haven't had a chance to test either set of strings out but I'm sure they'll be great.It's my understanding that the polywebs could practically be the last set of strings you ever buy (with some proper care).  I've been told that while nanowebs last longer than normal strings, they don't measure up to the polywebs."
80656,The cinematography alone makes Single-Handed worth watching the drama and thrills are along for a very enjoyable ride. I will watch all the seasons.
80657,This show is amazing. I can not wait for the next season to start. Hot guys and hot exciting action.
80658,"This is a great low cost stand that accepts both acoustic and electric guitars. The cradle and neck height are both adjustable enabling a variety of guitar sizes to be used.  While it doesn't fold up small like a portable stand, it serves well as a semi-portable stand and is very good as a stationary stand."
80659,"if this was going to be like a cartoon movie or Disney movie it would be great for kids.spoiler alertIf the father the main character who becomes grimlock is muscular and looks like a super hero then this might work out. kinda weird with the whole family becoming heroes at the end with like no training, it would be like &#34;the incredible's&#34; movie kind've..the computer in the secret cave thing was awesome reminded me of batman lol."
80660,"This is a perfectly fine, basic seat cover.  Incredibly easy to install.  It looks decent.  It's what you get for the price, but the important thing is -- it just works.Update:  I bought another set and the design is different than what is pictured.  FYI, it is not as ""simple"", it has a sort of design pattern on it.  Not terrible, but just different."
80661,"This Gilmour brass quick connector is made in China.  As with other Gilmour products it has a warning that it contains a chemical known by the state of California to cause cancer. That is nothing new about China using dangerous chemicals. On the good news side the parts of the connector that are handled have a rubber cover which hopefully is safe.I have been using the plastic quick connectors and they have worked well but I just wanted to see how a brass one would perform. The main difference that I have noticed is that the plastic ones are easier to connect and disconnect. However, both types provide satisfactory performance and do not leak. The main difference is that the plastic Gardena connectors that I have been using cost about half the amount of the brass Gilmour.  The Gardena connectors are made in Germany."
80662,"although the quality is obviously not that of a studio, this guy serves it's purpose and i am not dissapointed in buying it. i use it when i mess around in garageband, and it does a very good job for not being an expensive peice of equipment. it's also very easy to use, and the USB cord is super easy for using witha laptop or computer. plus, you canplug your headphones in and listen which is always a plus."
80663,"This Toro Trimmer replaced a first generation Worx GT in my yard care arsenal.  I loved the design of the Worx but the NiCad battery was a gutless wonder.  I was considering upgrading to their new Lithium-ion model when I was offered this Toro to test.  The comparison is night and day.  You can charge up the Lithium battery ahead of time and a week later it will still be ready to go like you just took it off the charger.  It has really good power and cut through all but the most hard core weeds I could find.  My dry run was on what is essentially a vacant lot, untended and overgrown.  I put the trimmer on the ""power save"" setting (the blade is positioned closer to the center so the cutting swath is less and the motor uses less juice due to the shorter line length)expecting the battery to run out long before I got finished.  I was nearly done with the yard and hadn't noticed any drop off in power so I switched out of power save mode and still had power left after doing the entire lot.  The trimmer easily switches to edger configuration and rolls easily to trim along walkways.  I did not ever see the line auto feed but it is so easy to manually feed it (just push a little button and pull out some more line).  Actually this will probably prevent wasted trimmer line in the long run.  I took off the little wire guard since it seemed to keep me from getting as close to my desired targets as I wanted.The only think I miss from the Worx trimmer is that the head on the Toro is fixed.  The Worx pivots so you can get a better angle to go under shrubs.  On the Toro, you just have to compensate with the angle at which you hold the shaft so it is more something to get used to than a big design flaw.The weight, balance and height adjustment of this tool work great for both me and my husband.  I used to dread edging but now we fight over who gets to do it!"
80664,"Great show!!  My kids, 7 and 4 years old love this show and have been watching it for a while.  Fuels their imaginations with positive play!"
80665,"As it is not metal, I would not use it for digging. It works great for scooping loose dirt which I love but I had hoped I could use it for digging also."
80666,"This was pretty good. There are some really bad independent zombie horror films out right now. It is no Fulci, or Romero, but it was fairly entertaining."
80667,"First I let it charge over night then I put it to work. I trimmed a few small things first to get used to it but then put it to work on a 60 foot long by 10 foot high laurel. Half way through the battery check light said it was done but it was still going strong after 2 hours. I decided to charge again over night and finished the other half the next day. I cut 2 to 3 feet off the top of the laurel plus down the sides. If I had two batteries I could have done it in one day easily.It is phenomenal not having a cord attached or having to deal with the loud and smelly gas options. It isn't too heavy and having at times to use only one hand to reach deep wasn't that difficult. Well balanced holding it with the two handles making it easy to control. From leaves to stock about 3/4 inch thick it had no problem.The only problem of course will be the usual maintenance and keeping it sharp.I love this machine. I was having a ball and trimmed a few things for my neighbor. I now have battery operated lawn mower, sweeper, edger and hedger in my yard maintenance arsenal. NO MORE CORDS!"
80668,An interesting movie but very dark.  I watched it once and decided I probably wouldn't watch it again.  I donated it to my local library.
80669,My son and daughter love the Curious George series and I'm surprised to say I learn a lot from it myself. Wonderful clean fun for the whole family...
80670,"I didn't expect a lot out of this Onion News comedy. It's like HBO's ""Newsroom"" meets ""Airplane."" Very funny, very quick and enjoyable. It is an absurd kind of humor with a lot of slide-in scenes -- kind of like Family Guy. I just liked everything about it."
80671,"It does the job. Smells like bubblegum. Wipes off very cleanly and easily with no residue. First time doing clay bar and on brand new car. This product made it easy. I note that the product was packed in a plastic bag, and the bottle leaked a bit. The bag leaked, and the box was noticeably soaked through in places. Not much product was lost."
80672,We got this setup and hung up in the yard and are now just waiting to see some humming birds.  It took a bit to get warmer in New England this year so hopefully soon.
80673,"The production and acting are superb. My wife and I enjoy Poirot on a relaxed Sunday eveningto end our week. Easy ,entertaining, well acted ...a great period series."
80674,"It's hard to review this because I don't know whether or not there were any mice in the room where the trap was set. There were mice there at one time but it's possible that they left and went down to the garage, where we did catch 4 mice with other traps. That was a month ago. I haven't caught a mouse in any of our traps since then.This did seem fairly easy to set."
80675,"I love this show.  The characters are very real.  There is humor both bold and subtle.  The mysteries are well written, and except for a mistake once in a great while, the watcher can suspend belief with this make believe investigative team of the CBI.  After all these seasons, we still aren't sure it Jane is a true physic trying to deny it due to the trauma in his life, or if his amazing abilities are really just a super sense of mental acuity.  I look forward to many more seasons of this entertaining show."
80676,Very helpful for me since I have a large garage but not many outlets. This allows me to reach vehicle batteries without pulling the battery or moving the charger everywhere with an extension cord.
80677,"I've been catching up on other shows and I finally got the the chance of watch this show from beginning to end and I really did like the show, can't wait for the second season."
80678,A-1 invention on these cool-cold days this item will keep your neck and lower jaw nice and warm all day. I love riding in 40 degree and above and without any wind i'm in my element.  worth the price
80679,Interesting product. It works well without alot of fuss and is reuseable. Would buy it again. Wish there was a way I didn't have to view the mouse but.. well..... I do not care. This works so I just grit my teeth and try to not get grossed out.
80680,"As usual, there are some characters you will like and others who you will love to hate.  So far, so good."
80681,"When its about wah effects I'm too careful cuz not all brands make it well. When I found this one I can be shure that there is no more wah sound out there, crunchy, warm and with the clarity of this... I prefere vox in wah effects, and this its a great choice and its too cheap for the quality you get!! 100% happy with this... Recommended!! :)"
80682,"I'm using this right now on my acoustic and it does its job in respect to holding your picks. It was smaller then I would have pictured, but it still is a good product. It can hold light to heavy picks and its super easy to put it and take it off. Only problem I had was that it moves a lot when putting my pick back in. Besides that, its highly recommendable to anyone. I will definitely pick up more for my other axes."
80683,"I was inspired by it. Men, with vision, built amazing businesses and dominated the USA. Love that. My only compliant is that they tried to bash the Republicans in it. But other than that, it was very inspiring and informative."
80684,"NO SPOILERS:The highest rated TV program in 2013 (with a score of 92) according to Metacritics was the French series ""Les Revenants"" (""The Returned"").  ""Resurrection"" is the latest USA TV offering that is hoping to capitalize on the success of its foreign doppelganger (I.E. ""The Bridge"").First and foremost, props for not simply providing an English translation of the French script.  While the premise is the same, there are some differences in the set up.As perhaps one can surmise by the title, ""Resurrection"" is about people who have died, returning to the Missouri town from where they are from and at the same stage of physical development as when they died.  The show kicks off with 9-year old Jacob waking up in a rice paddy in China, 32-years after he apparently drowned in a river adjacent to his home in Missouri.At the end of the first episode there was another resurrection and in coming weeks there will be more.While the first episode of the French series was superior and offered greater shock value, ""Resurrection"" had a good opening episode.  On a personal level, it is quite the achievement to get my 11-year old to avert her eyes from her smart phone!"
80685,This champion lawn mower tune up kit made it possible for me to tune up the mower alone. Normally I have to hire someone for it to be sure it is done right. This kit makes it so easy. Everything you need is in there for a tune up (except tools). This is very convenient. I can see myself buying this again.
80686,"Kevin Bacon!  What else can I say!  An A list actor whom you rarely ever see now on the big screen, I must admit I was a little apprehensive.  However, one episode and can you say hooked!  Truly a must watch if you are into suspense/thriller."
80687,"Costs about 2x as much as some cheap capos, and it's worth every single penny.  THis has a strong clip, yet does not damage my concert or tenor ukulele necks.  It won;t budge once you clip it, and it's low profile.  Made of metal, it should last a lifetime.I took off one star only for one thing: the hand clip portion of this does sometimes get in the way of fretting because it sticks out from the neck quite a ways.  Some other capos, like this oneJim Dunlop 7828 Russell Banjo/Uke Capodoes not have anything that you can hit your hand on when fretting.  Sometimes I try the Kyser on the opposite side, away from me, the player.  But, it seems to still hit my hand on some chords, just different ones.  That said, I can work around it, and it's a lifelong capo of fantastic build and keeps those strings from buzzing at all on all my ukes. If one was to have large hands, as I do not, this interference may be even more of an issue to consider.C ya.  Happy strumming.  Mahalo."
80688,Love this show . Billy Burke is great! Love the characters and story lines. Easy to get attached to the characters. I hope they keep it going they are really getting to some interesting stuff
80689,"We've enjoyed watching Justified season 5. We had never heard of the series until we started with Amazon Prime Instant Video and saw it in the lineup. We were hooked from the beginning. Raylon is the new Matt Dillon! The acting is great...not a bad performance in the bunch. Well worth watching for those who like westerns, detective shows, and great character development."
80690,"Without giving away this episode's make-up, I am glad that a case has finally been wrapped up and that movement forward in the world of the team can be now focused on.  I do hope that the series keeps up with the action and drama that it has been famous for.....ahh yes and including the pundits and humor that they have developed over the years.  Can not wait to see what is next in store for the team and wish all the actors, writers, directors, producers, and the individuals who are behind the scenes of this series ( camera men/women, sound developers, gaffs and all the others) a great big thanks for finding new ways to keep this series appealing to the many of us fans who seek to follow the fictional lives of this show."
80691,"I love Pretty Little Liars. Is one of the shows that you can't get enough of. This season is a little bit more about the feelings and every-day situations of the characters instead of A (like in seasons one and two), so here you get to see more about how the characters feel with their personal issues, but at the same time the A mystery that never stops.This season is full of twists, mysteries and crazy moments, and I think Pretty Little Liars is getting better and better in each season, it pushes everything a little bit more as the show grows. If you're a fan of the show, don't doubt on buying it! You'll get addicted episode by episode."
80692,"He is seriously scaring the sh!t out of me. Jessica Lange's performance in this episode is flat out amazing. Watching her play this character is probably the only reason I'll stick around for the rest of the season. I just can't get in to the bloody face, aliens, mutants-in-the-woods, exorcist stuff. Somebody just kill Adam Levine, already. Also, I GET IT RYAN MURPHY, Catholics are bad and you are scared of vaginas."
80693,"I bought these to haul my two kayaks.  Works great.  I would have given 5 stars, but it does not come with any reflectors or padding material.  Also, the flag it comes with was missing my first order, Amazon sent me a new one, but the flag is real cheap...just a piece of red thin plastic."
80694,"This two door trap is a humane way to catch feral cats or wildlife that needs to be relocated. The cage is sturdy and comes with simple instructions on how to use it with one trap door open or two. You might want to practice opening an closing the trap a couple of times before using it to catch an animal. The handle on top allows for easy release. It comes with a list of what kind of animals you may catch with this trap and what kind of bait to use.  As with catching any live animals, be careful about separating mothers from babies who may die without them. This trap is great for the home user who wants to protect their garden, as well as for people who work with wildlife rehabilitation and animal shelters. Very good quality and easy to use trap."
80695,I wanted a pair of ramps that would work on my Jeeps and my smaller vehicles. It doesn't matter if I'm rolling a jeep with 35s or a mini cooper on these things. Plenty of clearance and they don't slide.
80696,"Why it only has 4 stars I will never understand. The humor is one of a kind! The acting was right on, and the story line couldnt be any better."
80697,I bought the wrong pack(Was supposed to buy the light/medium pack) but its alright these picks let me try out a bunch of different gauges and materials to see what fit me best. My favorite pick out of this bunch was  the Dunlop Jazz 3 pick. It would be great if the item name was changed to like 'Dunlop 12 Med/Heavy pick variety pack' but that might be me being too picky.
80698,Really good start.  I am very interested in seeing these characters develop.  I would love to see this series picked up for an entire season.
80699,"Use this goop on trailer line connections and when you replace a bulb in any application where moisture is likely.  My Tracker boat trailer has incandescent bulbs and they are encapsulated in nearly water-tight containers, but they do get water within.  They are not meant to be 100% tight so if you replace a bulb, be sure to add some of this stuff to the socket.  Also, the true thief of light is corrosion, not bulb extinction, so apply some wherever there is a vulnerable spot.When changing spark plugs, along with the application of anti seize on the plug threads, use some dielectric grease at the junction of the coil pack and valve cover gasket and at the wire to coil pack."
80700,"Best Wheel Cleaner I have used Yes, you have to scrub the wheels but the outcome after it all, is just awesome the wheels look brand new."
80701,Five minutes of perfect romantic comedy; the animation is beautifully done.  Watch it after a bad day and cheer up.
80702,The way this show is produced leaves me fascinated and captivated throughout.  Switching from the research to the walk through is fantastic and I really enjoy seeing how it's all going to work out.
80703,"I ordered 4 of these traps after I saw a little mouse run across the garage floor. I used a pea-sized dab of peanut better for bait, as recommended in the instructions, then set two in the garage along a wall and the other two in our basement storage area, where I noticed some mouse droppings earlier.The next morning the two traps in the garage each had a mouse - and today (the second morning) there was another mouse in one of the basement traps.It is sort of gross to see the mouse's hind-end sticking out of the trap, but I used a bag for each to pick them up and then tied it shut and took it outside to the trash. I know the instructions said the traps are reusable (which they are) but I guess I'm a wimp -- I'd rather order new ones (which I just did). But if you wanted to reuse the traps it is very easy to do so -- you can release the snap mechanism without touching the mouse.The only (very minor) thing was that three of the traps set on the first try but the last one was a little tricky - I had to repeatedly mash down the lever to get it to set. And then if I even bumped it the trap snapped shut - on a hair trigger. But I finally got it in place along a wall in the basement and set it (that is the one that caught the mouse last night).I also have 4 of the round-type of traps that are designed to close when a mouse enters -- you can't see the mouse if it's inside but will know one is in there because the spring-mechanism moves from ""set"" to ""caught."" So far those haven't caught any mice  so looks like I'll stick with the product on this page. Glad to get rid of those mice."
80704,Somewhere between Lost and X-Files with a touch of Walking Dead.  This iis so going on my Watch List!  Highly recommended.
80705,"This line by black and decker is well made. I received the 36 volt lithium powered trimmer last year and love it. For general around the home use they work great. Battery life is good and lasts for most projects I have in my roughly 50' x 150' lot. I left the lithium battery from the trimmer in the shed over the winter in MN and it charged up fine this spring with no adverse effects. The units are quiet because they are electric, but have no cord to drag around and get in the way. The 36 volt lithium technology finally gives hand held yard tools the power and run time they need to actually be useful. As a blower the unit works well. It blows stuff around to where you want it to go. For spring and summer use it is fine for a normal yard. I won't be able to test the vac feature until fall nor really test the blower until the leaves hit the ground. I don't aniticpate having any issues then either, but I will have the luxury of having two batteries for bigger jobs."
80706,"The movie ""Freakonomics"" is based on the best-selling book of the same name.  Several documentaries, each with different directors, show how economics can work in daily life.  Cheating on pupil tests, the drop in crime rates in the USA, incentives in potty training, pupil achievement, and other interesting nuances that economists deal with are featured.  A lot of economics is predicting behavior of people, and that can be dicey.  Overall it provides a light and interesting way of looking at the dark science. The movie has good ideas and the scripts move well to keep you interested."
80707,"I had a smaller one of these, that I bought at Advance Auto. It was made by Peak and it was not nearly the unit that this is. Oddly enough this was on sale and cost me almost the same amount as the cheaper Peak unit did. This thing really has some gusto. I've only used it once, but was really impressed. I keep this in my 42 foot Motorhome. I use it for just about anything I need."
80708,"I love the interaction of all the ensemble characters and the beautiful stars.  I love the writing, the weirdness and the uncompromising scientific lingo.  I love the comedic relief and all the plot lines.  I love the story line and how it's unfolded.  I am hooked."
80709,I can't wait to see the rest of the season. I like the concept. Natalie Zea plays a great part.
80710,"The Wolo Model BA-97 Heavy Duty Commercial Grade Back-Up Alarm is perfect for the rear of any RV of size.  It&#8217;s small ( about 3 wide x 3&#8221; tall and 2&#8221; deep) and loud enough to alert anyone you are backing.  The sound is exactly like what you hear on garbage trucks and many commercial vehicles.Wiring the unit is simple and one of the mounting bolt/screw holes automatically grounds the horn to the vehicle chassis. I used the backup light wiring in the truck to trailer cable that was not used by my trailer to get the 12 Volt positive voltage to the trailer.  I then connected to the trailer wiring block using a14 gauge &#8220;hot&#8221; lead to take the voltage to the backup alarm mounted on the read of the trailer.  Whenever I have the trailer attached to the truck and then shift the truck into reverse Bingo.  The alarm begins beeping.  Of course anytime the truck backup lights are activated, like using the key fob to shut off the truck burglar alarm, the backup horn activates for about 30 seconds."
80711,"I wish it were longer than 11 episodes. I'd like to see them pull up a big treasure.  Treasure hunting was a hobby of mine when I was in my early 30s. Never found any of the lost GOLD in Arizona, or New Mexico though. Dry panned 1/4 ounce of gold, prospecting for a whole day in the hot sun. Worth about $9.00 back in the 70s."
80712,Dont buy not worth it to epensive did  gave it a try but i had to remove it whith my regular body shine thank you
80713,"It's facinating, funny, informative, and great television.  RuPaul is an innovator and should be applauded for enabling this segment of the gay population to become more visible.  These ladies are beautiful and funny.  This show allows us an inside peek into this beautiful world.  I hope the show runs forever."
80714,"Alpha house offers great acting along with a great cast. John Goodman, Clark Johnson, Mark Consuelos and Matt Malloy have great chemistry and the situations they find themselves in are funny and sometimes true. I loved the Stephen Colbert episode more than anything. Great show."
80715,"The premise of this program is simplistic and the writers don't do much with it.  A bunch of cops are given a few fragmentary, confusing clues about a crime, or something, in advance, and they have to figure out what the clues mean and stop the bad thing from happening.  Only instead of getting these clues from a medium or a psychic of some kind, these images get downloaded mysteriously from outer space.  The writer's don't do much of anything interesting with this idea.The characters are also poorly developed. The dialogue is mediocre at best. Bad British writers love to have their characters yell and scream and browbeat and insult each other and behave like incredibly annoying jerks.  There is a fair amount of that in this series.I had high hopes initially and looked forward to watching the episodes I bought. But after wading through four episodes, I am not at all surprised that the series was canceled after only 5 episodes. I would have canceled it myself."
80716,"Other than being a little cheaply built it works great. I like the fold up into a small package idea. Room for a stand in the vehicle can be a problem for most of these types of stands. I can put this over the shoulder, carry my guitar and gigbag in one trip."
80717,"I've been Birding my entire life. Growing up on a farm with fields, virgin prairie, wetlands, streams and forest, about the ONLY birds we never saw were those from the Tropics. I've taught birding classes at many a nature sanctuary and I have over 14 feeding stations on our acre of land with 5 bird baths, too. So, I'm no novice.When offered this water station, I was very excited, hoping that the smaller warblers and finches would find it attractive since they are such skittish birds. I hung this waterer from a pine limb that's dead and very stationary; it is right in the midst of the finch/warbler feeding stations.After a solid week of trial, Not.One.Single.Bird. has either approached it, attempted to approach it or even considered it!!! Now, birds are opportunists and will investigate ANYTHING that is new in their area. I've put out brand new feeders they've never used at 4:00 p.m. and by 4:10 p.m., the feeder is filled with birds. And it's not as if I didn't watch that area for interaction, as it's Spring Migration season Up North and I'm doing Bird Counts of migrants, being able to eyeball the waterer for hours on end.I'll keep it up, and if nothing else, the flying insects will get water from it. I'm sad. There was a lot of promise and hope with this product but zero delivery. I ranked it 3 stars because it is very well made and came with clear instructions. But, just like when you buy a toy for your cat or dog and they NEVER play with it, it doesn't mean the toy is Bad, it just means that it holds no attraction to your individual pet. So it is with this device: I can't rate it as bad in construction and I can't rate it as ""bad"" for providing water, just MY birds had no desire to even attempt to use it. Sorry. :("
80718,"Going to these from what I was using, I can fit 2 more pedals on my pedalboard, so mission accomplished!"
80719,"This product is easy to use - just wet the ground around the hostas and sprinkle some of the pellets on the ground. The pellets are a little hard to shake out of the bottle, but the other opening lets too many come out at once. Slugs chew up my hostas pretty badly each year (some more than others) and I'm happy to say that I have less holes in my plants this year! I do feel like I'm going to need to do a 2nd application though. I would recommend you do this early in the season when it's easier to get the granules underneath the plant before it gets too big."
80720,"They work ok unless you are camping where the ground is hard. The nails bend easily if put in hard dirt.  Otherwise, they do the job ok."
80721,The quality of the light fixture is good.  There is no base gasket provided with the fixture.  I used silicone to seal it to the camper.  Would  have been better with a foam gasket.
80722,"I like these because they are thick, soft, have a long nap and short nap side, and are bigger than the Polishing Cloths.  I could remove the wax haze from the exterior of my full-size car with one towel without feeling I was driving the old wax into the new finish."
80723,This is a great buy and solid quality. I would strongly recommend it. I have one hanging at both my houses.
80724,"I think it's fair to say that Hannibal Lecter became an American horror icon for most people with the Oscar winning film ""The Silence of the Lambs.""  Personally, I discovered Lecter back in 1981 when author Thomas Harris introduced him in ""Red Dragon.""  As a kid, I read this novel with a sick fascination and it was easily the scariest book I had read up until that point.  Michael Mann adapted it into the film ""Manhunter"" in 1986 with character actor Brian Cox in the Lecter role, but it wasn't until 1991 and Anthony Hopkins that Lecter became incredibly popular.  Hopkins revisited the role with another interpretation of ""Red Dragon"" and then ""Hannibal,"" and has owned the role ever since.  When I heard that NBC was helming a drama based on Lecter, I thought it was a disastrous idea!  Network television is no such place for such evil!  But I must say that the program has far exceeded my rather limited expectations.  Created as a prequel to the events of ""Red Dragon,"" the show has a thoughtful slow burn appeal that shows surprising restraint. The program might have some gore, to be sure (especially by traditional network standards), but it succeeds most spectacularly as a psychological study of two men with more in common than they'd like to admit.The plot centers around a FBI profiler named Will Graham (Hugh Dancy).  Graham can literally get into the mindset of a killer, and the show stages vivid and brutal recreations as Graham uses these skills to analyze crime scenes.  This innate ability to think like a monster has taken an emotional toll on Graham, and he is an absolute mess.  Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen) is a brilliant psychiatrist who aids in an early investigation but is drawn to the darkness within Graham.  Through the course of the episodes, Graham and Lecter become closer.  Each seems to get something very important from the relationship.  Are they doctor and patient?  Friends?  Or is Lecter playing a sick game of cat and mouse?  It's a fascinating dynamic, one of the strongest components of this show.  While some of the episodes are self-contained, more and more is revealed about Lecter as the season progresses.  Anyone who is familiar with ""Red Dragon"" might know where this is ultimately heading, but it's the journey that is more important than the destination in this case.Dancy is pretty terrific as the scarred and haunted hero.  And Mikkelsen is the master of understatement.  He underplays every scene to perfection, and this detachment gives ""Hannibal"" a chilling center.  Other familiar characters from the books (and movies) are present like reporter Freddie Lounds (a female in this version), prison warden Frederick Chilton, and FBI Director Jack Crawford (played by Lawrence Fishburne).  Gillian Anderson also pops up for a few episodes as Lecter's therapist and they play off each other wonderfully.  ""Hannibal"" is generally well cast, although some of the smaller recurring roles have yet to be developed in any kind of meaningful way.  But as long as Graham and Lecter remain in the center, you aren't really paying much attention to the peripheral cast.The plotting in these 13 episodes is a mix of self-contained stories with several significant on-going threads.  Not every individual case is a compelling as the central story strand, but that's to be expected.  I always wonder why everyone in the world isn't dead with the number of serial killers that populate popular entertainment!  What really distinguishes ""Hannibal,"" though, is its tone.  It is not played as an action thriller.  Oftentimes, it is quiet and contemplative relying on character interactions to up the unease factor.  It is smart, literate, and takes its time.  That's what was so unexpected for me, and why the show might not be perfectly suited for someone looking for mindless entertainment.  It requires and rewards patience.  The actors are great, the staging is unsettling, and the effects are solid.  This was put together by a team (led by Bryan Fuller from Heroes and Pushing Daisies) who wanted to honor the Lecter legacy and be true to it.  One of the more unusual network offerings of the last year, and one of the best.  KGHarris, 5/13."
80725,"Overall this was a decent little flick for a first time writer/director, and Jeff Daniels proved again his skill level in showing multiple personalities in the same film.The story follows a world famous reclusive (single) author that no one can recognize, as he strives to get rid of his book collection and fix his ailing back while living in Philly. Coincidentally (this film has just a few too many of those) a single chiropractor and a broke book store owner happen to cross his path, both in turn looking to fill their respective voids. Romance, dysfunction and life learning happens in a bout of small doses.The Blu clarity shines through for Philly in a variety of locations, but there was an incessant artifact throughout that catches the eye repeatedly. The DTS gets used maybe twice (the kitchen scene where the B&W; movie he is not watching filters through the left channels and one other scene) but sounds clear otherwise. The supplements are standard and include:* 10:14 minute Characters of Answer Man. A plug piece that is film clip heavy.* 9:57 Concept to Creation. More talking heads that cover some minimal background.* 4:33 HDNet clip. The standard ad promo as shown on the network.* BD Live. Stated ""check later for updates"".* Bookmarks option.* Cast/Crew commentary. More of a conversation piece, best plug I got out of it was hearing the director stating this first film was like a ""learning cliff"".Was not exactly pleased with the type of closure they give, but it is a light film that will keep the fans of any of the five leads a decent showing. 3.5 for the movie and Blu, .5 for the supplements."
80726,"Car need a good cleanup to shine?  Use this.  I have a black Lexus and when used, its amazing how much of the hairline scratches go away and how deep and glossy the black ends up.  Follow up with their NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0 and the shine and depth come out even more.  Looks like it just came out of a paint shop."
80727,I bought this audio cable and all I gotta say is that this thing can last and it will not give you any trouble. Good stuff!
80728,"This pilot had a lot of laughs and some cool characters.  It was really, really absurdist and more than a bit frenetic.  It jumped quickly from one crazy, improbable thing to the next.  The combination of really chaotic plot-driven comedy with lots of random ""Onion headlines"" worked well, although it seems like that is a delicate balance to keep.  I loved Jeffrey Tambor and Cheyenne Jackson in this.  The one thing I am a bit worried about is that the characters seem a bit too shallow and 'caricaturey' (if that is a real adjective).  I think that can work for something more short-form, but I am a bit worried about whether I will care about any of the characters over the course of an entire season of episodes.Nevertheless, I am definitely interested in seeing more."
80729,This filter is a must have if you want to have water that is clean and as pure as your home filtered water. I believe that by using this filter the water that we will get from the different campsights will be as close to home aas possible. Easy to use and store a must have for those who are concerned about what they drink.
80730,"We like the acting and the plots are intriguing, though sometimes rather complicated.  The accents are difficult for us to catch sometimes, but we make do or replay portions.  Entertaining."
80731,This show has it all. It has drama and action. The chemistry of the cast is one I have not seen in a while. The ongoing story with the main character has twists and turns that always make you go wow!
80732,"This is a fine cable at a decent price point, nothing exceptional mind, but it gets the job done well enough."
80733,This and the first episode are familiar to those who are ardent listeners to his WTF podcast. It is a nice combination of humor and sentiment. Can't wait for more.
80734,"As expected, this genuine Mopar part fit perfectly on my '03 Jeep Grand Cherokee WJ.  Clean air is great and this was worth it."
80735,"I liked it!!! A girl goes to a party and either a guy gives her some sort of terrible v.d or puts something deadly in her drink.Eithier way we see a downward spiral to her health and apperance. Man I love horror movies..but there's soooo much bunk out there. I found this well acted,good plot and action. I was puzzeled by the total ignorant doctor who can't seem to help and mother who thinks shes on drugs,when shes clearly turning into something other worldly...but hey..its a movie!! And a good one!!!"
80736,"This is one of those shows that keeps me wanting more of it. I like the premise of it and how methodical they are in each week&#34;s episode to keep me on the edge of my seat.You get know the characters on this kind of show and I like that. This show is using a different way to end each episode by not revealing previews of next week&#34;s show.....WHOA! I LIKE THAT! They keep you wanting more....will the lady scientist FINALLY find that cure....now we&#34;ve seen how fragile the humans on board the LAST SHIP....what is in store for them, & the world, NEXT! I tell you this show is NOT BORING! TNT has brought us an excellent show here.....and I can&#34;t wait until next week!"
80737,very good... thank you
80738,"I love police procedurals. My favorite is the Swedish Wallander, so that's the standard I compare others against, and Single-Handed does a great job of entertaining me and making me want to see more. The acting is superb, so much so that you can forget they are actors and believe in these complicated people, their small town on the western edge of Ireland, and the tough lives they lead. I enjoyed every minute."
80739,this season of veronica mars was thriling it always keept me on edge and always wonting to watch the next episode there is only one thing that i did not like and that was the the season ended and there is no season 4 to go on that is the only thing that i did not like.
80740,It's a shame that there are so many addicts that there needs to be a reality show about them. I am forever ashamed at how self absorbed so many of them are!
80741,"This movie, as many these days, is very predictable. No spoilers, but I want to know where the device came from and who owned it or made it?  Unanswered questions.... Just okay, nothing spectacular here.  One watch is sufficient."
80742,"strong.installs in seconds.simple design.looks great.back seat passengers use them ALL THE TIME.i have the overhead handles by rugged ridge on the roll bars and i got these to supplement those,but these are actually used more by folks in the back seat.they fit my 2012 jk wrangler perfectly but will work on any vehicle that has the two metal posts on the head rests.(as long as you can remove the headrest)it literally took me 60 seconds to install both of these into my jeep.def recommend these to any one who ones a 4 door jeep.good price.will last for years to come."
80743,Very good finish top cost or fiberglass RV & Marine products.Goes on easy comes off clean.  I have used a light weight polisherWhen doing our camper.Last for months.  Good product.
80744,"What an idea, great cast and we loved how each actor played off the other. Well written and acted. Love it. I want to see more."
80745,"This is such a great battery maintainer that I bought another one just like it. The weather proof feature makes it that much more handy, as it stays outside all the time. Keeps batteries fully charged and ready to go all the time!"
80746,I love this more adult spinoff version from Vampire Diaries.  The writing is terrific!  And the casting is just right too!
80747,For those of you that stayed with the show through Season 1 your reward comes in Season 2.  Go ahead and buy the whole season because it doesn't conclude until the very last show.  It's worth it.  I don't know how.  A ginger in the lead and a partner who epitomizes a meth-head should not have a great cop show by any formula I can understand!!  It was so worth it to buy both seasons!  Enjoy.  You will not figure it out until the end.
80748,"I probably should have bought something a bit more flexible and less rugged since I constantly coil/uncoil it for washing cars, but that's my fault not a product fault."
80749,"We're newbies to smoking and decided to purchase the Weber 721001.  It has worked out well for us.  Easy to use, clean, move around, everything!  The thermometer and side opening coat flap is a great feature.  We're able to fit a lot of items in the smoker at once (ex: a brisket on the bottom rack, and nuts and salt on the top rack).  So far we've smoked cornish hens, chicken, brisket, salt, and almonds.  All have turned out great.  Have not attempted to use this to ""cold smoke"" yet but would like to in the future to try cheeses."
80750,"Season two finds us with yet another copy cat killer on the loose and our obsessive compulsive DI must use his colorful team of investigators to find the killer (or killers).  I love that this show takes old crimes and has the copycat killer recreate them down to the tiniest details!  The development of the relationship between DI Chandler and his Sgt. Miles is perhaps the best thing about the show, but I love everything about it.  Usually with a series there is always that one character that you wish would get killed off because they are so annoying....not with this show.  There's not a single recurring character that I don't like.  This is my new favorite show!  Love it!"
80751,"Not my kind of film. Too gross, poor acting. I watched this movie for 10 minutes then called it quits."
80752,"I love this show! I look forward to watching it every week. It has a lot of talent, a great story line and things keep you guessing every week. I'm addicting to Nashville!"
80753,"Great slap echo sound.  Do not buy this with the expectation that it will act like a digital delay- it's closer to a reverb.  It provides an echo sound similar to if you were playing in a room covered in tile (an old engineering trick!).  Great for old school rock and roll, rockabilly, chicken pickin etc.  This will fatten up the sound of a dry amp.  As with all FAB pedals, I find the knob placement slightly annoying, but at this price point you can't really make a justifiable complaint.  Construction quality is somewhat cheap but the knobs feel solid and it has not failed me in more than a year."
80754,From all the guys that send their oil out to the labs .. And the studies say that this stuff is the best .. So I use it.
80755,"See my review on season 1, it only disappoints more in the end.  Watch and you'll see, not terrible but just lazy."
80756,"Fiskars tools are my favorite and preferred garden tools, and with this line, they have gotten even better. These loppers are very light for their size, something you will appreciate when you are going up and down a ladder. They have the gear-style mechanism that gives them greater leverage than most loppers. The steel blades have a rust resistant coating that also prevents them from gumming up when cutting sticky, sappy plants. These cut thru green wood and dead wood up to 2 inches without straining, they cut smoothly and left a clean cut behind. The cork handles also provided an excellent grip, which is also important when up on that ladder.Over all, these are the best pair of loppers I have ever owned and depending on how long they last, I may not need another pair."
80757,This sprayer is very well built and solid.  It is easy to use and with the long hose and 18 inch wand it sprays a very good distance and the spray is of course adjustable to different spray patterns.  I am happy with hit.
80758,Loved the songs and story line is interesting.  I am looking forward to seeing more. Hopefully it gets enough approval to keep going.
80759,This is OK but it is so tough to believe the story line that it becomes more stupid than entertaining.  It could have potential if you made it more believable.
80760,I ordered this for replacement from oem gas cap and it fit very good on my Honda with great success
80761,wow a good show. To good of a show not to have a second season or even more. I know firefly is the best show ever not to have a second season. this one is in the top 10. first 2 hours are a little slow but after that hold on.....well worth the power to run the tv. if You love science fiction you will love this
80762,"These are great.  They fit into standard 14&#34; x 14&#34; RV vents and serve the same purpose as a draft guard on your door.  They have a soft cotton cover that covers the foam core.  The top side also features a heat reflective panel for use in reflecting sunlight in summer.  They're sized perfectly and fit my Forrest river's four ports just fine.  Now there always has to be a caveat...  There are two with these.  First if you have a shallow port they may stick out from the ceiling a bit.  Second, I have Ventline vents with knobs...these don't obstruct the plug going in.  However, other vent manufacturers use cranks which protrude down more than the knobs.  For a best fit, these cranks should be removed.  Other than that, these plugs do a great job of keeping the cold out."
80763,"Yes indeed I want more of this show. What a representation of America, love it! Life is complicated, far from perfect, beautiful in its imperfections."
80764,"...it kills mice at an extremely slow pace.We had an invasion of mice after a neighbor's shed was remodeled last summer (yikes! Why were they all in there?). Anyway, I tried out this style, the glue traps and the old-fashioned traditional traps. This came in a 2-pack and 1 eventually killed a mouse after the other style of traps and the glue traps took out what seemed to be a platoon of the things. I was pleased that I could just toss it away and not have to mess with the little mouse corpse or clean up anything.The second trap disappeared one day. Maybe our Jack Russel Terrier ran off and chewed it up (she seems to love to consume plastic - plastic with a mouse as filling might appeal to her as well) or maybe a really big mouse walked off with it. Either way, it sat out for months and every once in a while I'd pick it up and find that the bait was gone and the trap did not fire off."
80765,"Great inexpensive strap.  Really, what more can you say?  I wanted something to hold my guitar up, and it does just that."
80766,"The first season, particularly the pilot, just drew me in.  Good pacing, good plotting, interesting characters and plausible situations. The later seasons get a little bit more complicated (situations, plots, and premises) and I sometimes get tired with trying to keep up with what's going on, nod off and fall asleep.  But the first season, yeah, 5 stars!"
80767,"Seriously, this show makes me want to put on all leather and keep a knife strapped to my leg. I highly recommend starting from the first season to understand the character/plot dynamics. The third season drags a little bit of the finale is TOTALLY worth it!"
80768,So far very nice wipers they do a good job even in the snow. They are a little pricie so we will see if they are worth the money but so far so good!!
80769,"Was hesitant at first after reading reviews, but for the price I couldn't lose. Own 2009 Wrangler...This one pack covered all the fenders and wheel well mud deflectors, and then some. Make sure you follow the direction, clean and keep dry in garage while instal, over night set.  Had on since Aug 2013, slight rub off if u over flow gas tank but not enough to mess up finish, Happened to me 3 times. Very pleased and made a big difference"
80770,"You can't go wrong with these. I've installed them on EVERY Fender I own. Even if you don't use the trem very often, they help maintain proper tuning if you overbend (which I'm prone to do). I haven't had any tuning or slippage issues when I have these on, and you shouldn't either.Easy to install also, and for the money, give them a go...they're just as solid as the pricier ones...and they're Fender, so how can you go wrong?"
80771,"It's been loaded with peanut butter from 9/27/10 until today, which is a bit over 2 months, and it hasn't caught a mouse.  This mousetrap doesn't work.  It was moved around to various places throughout the house and no mice were caught.Finally, after becoming frustrated with this item, I tried inexpensive mice pellets and that seemed to do the trick.This item is expensive and it doesn't seem to catch mice.  I wouldn't pay a penny for it.  The mice are probably getting a good laugh out of this contraption.  Not recommended!  Zero stars."
80772,"This cartoon is so much fun to watch.  My grandchild enjoys the 'plot', music, colors, shapes, and the business of the characters!  It's entertaining and a good learning tool for shapes, designs/colors, and measurements for toddlers.  Strongly recommend it, you won't regret purchasing it for your child or children."
80773,"I watched all of the episodes of this series, mainly because of Damian Lewis.  I saw him in Band of Brothers playing an American Officer in the 82nd Airborne Screaming Eagles. (seems we don't have any American actors to play these parts-guess we have a talent shortage here in the colonies).  He is a good actor and the writing of the series was great, with a great gimmick for the main character.  I think they cancelled this series too early.  It could have been better given time to work out the kinks."
80774,"Battery Tender makes good stuff, and this is another of their useful tools. It's very simple, a no-nonsense extension cord that comes in handy when the battery charger has to be plugged in a little distance from my motorcycle or when operating a tire pump a ways away."
80775,"If you need to figure out and set spark plug gap, this little tool works great. For the money, you can't go wrong with this in your tool box. Run the plug along the metal bar to the correct gap and you are all set to go. Not much else to say on this. Perfect size and perfect price."
80776,"This is for the Episode One Night.This entire series just barely holds my interest. it has just the bare minimum of explanatory material to take it to a high school mentality level, for those in high school,  instead of a 6th grade mentality. However, episodes like this one are lazy writing, inane, and intellectually annoying.So, Will and his new girlfriend (Abby) are accosted by gang members in order to save their leader's life. The writers of the episode couldn't think of anything else, so they wrote in the leverage that if Will didn't save the gang leader, the second in command would kill both of them. Really?So let me get this straight. The second in command, wanting the leader to be saved by Will, threatens to kill Will, if Will doesn't save the leader? I mean it looks like she doesn't have any leverage at all. Will could simply say he wants this or that (safe passage after the fact, for instance) or she might as well shoot the leader herself, since that's the logical outcome. (The second in command wanted Will to kill the leader by making it look like an accident, but she still had to make it look that way. Killing Will remains an illogical way to achieve that end., and so the evaluation I offer is valid.)What's more, the gang will probably kill them anyway (Will and Abby deduce this). So, in fact, the second in command has no leverage at all.In the mean time, Will concocts  a plan whereby Abby gets free, and while free the first thing Will instructs her to do is call Sanctuary. Abby does get free, and runs back to Will. Her explanation is that she didn't want them to kill Will because she escaped. Again, if they kill Will, their leader dies. Two things here: (1) Why can't she make a simple 20 second call to Sanctuary before coming back and (2) Killing Will is the same as killing the leader, so until all avenues of Will saving the leader's life are exhausted, Will is safe.Very poor deductive thinking and thus poor writing. Of course if you're a sixth grader with limited mental capability, you probably won't notice the fallacy. For the rest of us, we do, and I won't be purchasing the next season. I purchased the entire 3rd season, so I will probably finish it. But then is see ya to bad writing and an insult to average intelligence."
80777,"it's a hilarious film. but if your family bears any resemblance, be prepared to cringe as much as you laugh."
80778,This worked perfectly for my Tacoma 2010 except it had to be rotated 90 degrees when i installed it. So the hard parts of the filter faced the back and front instead of the sides like the Factory filter. Still good fit for the price of 6.40 when i bought it.
80779,"Therapists may exist in agents' offices taking in star athletes like little puppies while the dastardly deeds of the FBI and the agency itself romps around in the background creating the DARK CLOUD to the enlightened moral code of therapy.  BUT, I doubt it."
80780,"We've been using Miracle-Gro Shake 'N Feed Rose Continuous Release Plant Food for years with great success.Like much of gardening America, we grow Knock Out roses; ours are coupled with PeeGee Hydrangeas along a fence.  The Miracle-Gro is easy to apply.  I just walk along the row and shake out the fertilizer around each plant - both roses and hydrangeas.  Then I go back and sratch it into the surface.  An application of water and I'm done for three months.But it's the results that matter.  And ours are good.  Knock-Out roses are easy to grow, but a little Miracle-Gro makes all the difference in stunning results and just ordinary."
80781,"This microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the XLR connector mates firmly with most cables. The included cable is light duty, but not bad if you treat it with respect.The mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the frequency range with resonant lows, smooth midrange and crisp highs. For almost any singer or announcer, this will be just what they need. The cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise, making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production. The sound is unbelievable, especially at this price. For under twenty dollars, this Pyle-Pro mike can't be beat.One issue I have with this mike is when using it on a Tascam DR40 portable recorder with an XLR to XLR cable, the Tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics. Both of my Pyle Pro mikes have the same problem, but both mikes work perfectly with any other device. The Tascam D40 is known for this noise issue, but usually not when using the XLR input."
80782,Installation was relatively easy with 2 people.  I had to elongate one hole in order for driver side to fit.  Passenger side mounted perfectly.
80783,"sad to see the end of Amy and Rory, but Asylum of the Daleks is a pretty fun romp. The introduction of Rory's dad as a foil in Dinosaurs on a Spacechip and the Power of Three was nice. A true outsider's view of the proceedings was nice, and seeing Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart's daughter carrying on the family business of UNIT was fun."
80784,I replaced our non-working 12 volt converter with this.  I did have to replace the included distribution panel but it was not as difficult as I thought it would be. The charger works great and regulates the voltage to the battery for storage.  I leave the trailer plugged in all the time now and it doesn't boil out the battery like the stock one would.Took about 1 hour to install
80785,"The first episode was a little bit of a departure from the end-of-season episodes last year: it was less intense because the big threat was gone.  Rusty's saga continues with a new theme developing, and you wonder where this one will go (but my guess is it will not be good.  the crime of the episode is not seen but becomes obvious as forensic work and found items move the plot forward...the final ten minutes hold a surprising twist, and as it ends in sociopathic self-justification you get a little bit of 'moral advice'...if you want it.  The episode m,moved so quickly I was startled when it was over--couldn't believe an hour had passed so fast."
80786,"Using this for polishing stainless steel pistols as well as internal gun parts. So far, it works great without the usual noxious fumes and stench of some other cleaners."
80787,"Have You ever seen them $500.00 Water faucets at Lowes? I hate Jonesy stuff, Lowes needs to separate their store one side the Jonesy stuff the other side the practical Items.So far this Is the best shut off valve I know of, It will withstand the freezing cold better than all other shut off valves especially plastic even If It does bust the leak will Not be as bad as with plastic, also It with stands hot Water and high pressure very well, but the tightener needs to be made out of metal Instead of plastic also the knobs are hard to turn and I have to keep some pliers near by to turn It on or off but other than that Its almost perfect."
80788,"At first I wasn't sure what to make of this - it was good , but lacked something.In the later episodes it just got better and better and I do believe this show can hold it' s own.Thanks to some great actors, good writing and directors this is really  a great new series and I hope people will give it a fair shake."
80789,Love it! I love everything about it. The leading lady is amazing! Simply amazing. Great comedy! Please continue this show.
80790,"If you really like to cook and have knowledge on why and how things do what they do this is for you.  It is fun and entertaining like Bill Nye the science guy on food.  Great stuff you like to learn, and know to try and break rules in cooking."
80791,This pump works as advertised.  I needed it to transfer fluid to the rear differential of my Honda Element.  Screwed it into the quart bottle of fluid and pumped differential full......no muss no fuss!
80792,"I love to barbeque even in the winter but hate getting the black smutty charcoal dust all over my hands while prepping the grill. I have seen plastic scoops that don't hold up or are too small but this one is perfect. It's aluminum so it won't rust and is weather tough. It's heavy gauge so it won't bend while serving hefty helping of coals to the grill, and it's stylish and affordable. Who could ask for more?"
80793,"my back used to prevent me from working on the boat and car for too long, but with this creeper seat I can get so much more done in a day. Good quality and sturdy"
80794,"I live in New England was bought this for a christmas gift. Each snow fall I used this with I was not very happy. I could shovel faster than this thing works (with more effort granted). The ability to angle the snow in a particular direction was just above worthless. Half the snow you are angling always ends up going right in front of you. The problem with this, is that this is only rated for 6 inches of snow (though I have used it up to a foot) but as you push the snow you inevitably end up putting the snow right back in front of you adding inches to the snow you are trying to move.I like the idea of electric snow blowers and think it would be a great use for me but without the ability to direct the snow properly this becomes alot more work than necessary in heavy snow. Keep the snow less than 6 inches and you wont have too much of a problem.I do not recommend this product and would never buy this tool for myself. I will be buying the greenworks 12 amp snow thrower to replace this one."
80795,"I own several Perky-Pet brand items and have always loved their products.  I really love EVERYTHING about this squirrel-proof, EXTRA LARGE bird feeder; except for the price.I have 5 other feeders in my fenced-in yard and the birds in my yard flocked to the feeder on the very first day I hung it up.  No clogging, no squirrels, great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder. If you don't mind the price, I would urge you to purchase this feeder.  It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard!Happy Feeding!"
80796,The best part of Season 4 is in Alaska.It seems the crew we first followed in Season 1 hasn't learned much about planning because they constantly seem to be ill-prepared and make the same mistakes time and time again.If there is a season 5 it will only be because of the interest people have in what the guys are doing in Alaska.
80797,The birds seem to like the product as well as any others I have used.  The crushed corn does tend to draw in some larger birds.  I also like the fact that everything is small enough not to clog up the feeders I use.  Price seems to be comparable to what I have found in big box stores without the trip to the store.
80798,"This bloody, sexually explicit show is more enjoyable than &#34;Deadwood&#34; or &#34;The Sopranos&#34;. Plenty of crime, vice, sex, greed, murder and mayhem, enough to satisfy everybody's bloodlust. And to cap it off the show is well written and fast paced. I watched it when it first came out and loved it. Now I can watch two or three episodes at a sitting and I'm enjoying it even more."
80799,I have a new car and the last thing I want is it covered in swirl marks.  I went looking for the softest wash mitt and this is it.  I use a foam blaster and high foam soap.  I wash this in the laundry after each use so no dirt stays behind to scratch the car next time around.  After 3 washes this year i can say the paint still looks brand new.
80800,"I think the basic premise that the widow stubbornly refuses to sell the team is canned but the monkey, the college q-back, the new GM all were great and I hope this one makes it.  I'll watch it and I'm sure lots of people who like sports and comedy will too."
80801,This speaker has a very clear full range sound. I have it in a '63 Brown Deluxe and am very good with it. .In a way it reminds me a bit of a JBL with the smooth depth and clarity. If I want a little Ray Charles raspcan get it from the amp and not speaker with pick attack. Cool speaker and nice addition.
80802,This stand is a little difficult to open.  The top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way.  Other than that the stand collapses very small into the black bag that came with it.
80803,i was pretty happy with them when i got them and finally used them and will likely pick up more once i need them.
80804,"I do a lot of podcasts and dubbing over videos, and after using this filter, the pop that occurs with P's and B's in the voice are basically gone. It makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances."
80805,"This is show is on par with VH1 Surreal Life in which I had experienced three episodes due to having the flu and not being able to change the channels. People get very dramatic when the camera is present. Include Gold Rush in that same category.Yeah, why watch if I do not enjoy them? The same reason I had to check why traffic is slowing down - to see the accident. Scenics awesome , at least on the episodes I had watched. But no more!Amazon, thank you, for even if these shows are starring the worse actors in the world the picture quality is awesome!"
80806,"A lot of creepy stuff. I have hopes, since this is Chris Carter, but right now it has just a tad too much of a &#34;J J Abrams&#34; feel. Please, please, PLEASE don't rely on endless mysteries that go nowhere, and tense music instead of acting and writing to carry the drama! We're counting on ya, Chris!"
80807,"I watched the very first episode but decided that enough was enough. Over the last 8 seasons I have watched as this show has went from interesting paranormal research to scripted reality. This episode was no exception. I have no words on how disappointed I am in Grant and Jason. When the show started they presented Ghost hunting in a positive light. With proper ways to investigate and going to real people's homes. Now they just look like abunch of bafoons. Jason never believed in everything they heard/saw, but now he cops to anything. It use to be personable and watchable, now it's just a joke. They 'jumped the shark' when they brought in the ghost hunting dog. Thanks Grant and Jason for destroying something I loved all in the name of ratings!"
80808,"This one filter has done the job in my 2001 Silverado for 13 years and 225,000 miles. I have never had the heads off, so I cannot comment on the condition of the cylinder walls. Does not burn oil and still runs great. I have not cleaned it as often as I should have. Have only cleaned it 2 times. So counting it being clean when installed, it's been without dirt 3 times in 225,000 miles. No evidence that any dirt ever got through it. Use the K&N cleaner and no other cleaners. Do not use hot water as it can shrink the cotton fibers making the filter look wavy. All of the dirt will wash out with ease. Let dry, I sit mine in front of a fan. Recoat with the K&N oil which is red so you can see that you have fully covered it. Put a thin coat of K&N grease on the neoprene seal and you are ready again. This filter maintains it low restriction to air flow, even when very dirty. I have these in all of my vehicles, not to save money, but because they stop dirt better and allow more air flow. Cars that sit outside sometimes attract mice that chew up the paper air filter and make a nest. Not possible with the oil soaked K&N."
80809,Bought product to try on mirrors and bumpers and mud flaps a friend said ot is amazing stuff we will see
80810,"I have owned B&D cordless outdoor equipment for 10+ years.  They are of such high quality I rarely need to replace them.  But the batteries are so expensive, sometimes it pays to just buy new.  Enter this trimmer...my first use lasted about 3 minutes and I did notice it spun much faster and louder than my previous 18V.  I went to hang it back up on the wall but first decided to check the line length remaining out of curiosity.  It had maybe 5 inches left!  Huh?  It was a new spool when I installed it.  All I did was trim grass, I thought to myself.  Next week I installed a new line and made absolute sure that I was trimming grass and not dirt.  Same result.  I called B&D and was told this was an issue with the older models but not this one.  She sent me a replacement for free.  I tried the second one and had the exact same experience.  Back it went as well.  I am just going to replace batteries in my old model because using a spool a use compared to one every year is just ridiculous to me."
80811,"I love the way they actually do the work, a room or part of the house at a time.  It's much more helpful and interesting than &#34;overnight&#34; make over shows.  Wish I could get more than one season with Prime!"
80812,"As most people find themselves rooting for the underdog, a couple who are Russian spies in the U.S.  I can't root, nor watch this, I'm in conflict over the fact that I'm an American.  I'm caught between rooting for the FBI guy to catch the couple and the couple.  Wouldn't recommend any American to watch it."
80813,My rating is based on the opinions of assorted birds.  They never leave a crumb of this stuff in the suet holder on the bird feeder.  Must be good !!
80814,"Action-Adventure PG-13 inter-generational family fun Sci-Fi and buddy, leans a bit boy oriented. However my son and I enjoy this show immensely."
80815,"I'm not sure if it's supposed to be this way, but the Deer Off product I received was the consistency of buttermilk. The package was marked ""ready to use,"" so I know it's not meant to be diluted. I don't know what happened, but I do know sometimes stuff like this gets frozen in storage or sitting on a loading dock and changes consistency. Since I received it, it's been in my garage where the cold-hating cacti spent the winter.The sprayer was firing, but the repellent was too thick to make it through the gun and out. The sprayer seemed to have a lot of power when I sent water through it.If the sprayer worked with the Deer Off, this would be a great product. I ended up ""painting"" some of the leaves of my squash where I noticed the rodent damage yesterday. I'll report back if they quit nibbling. If it works, I have ornamental plants that the jackrabbits won't leave alone that I'll try it with.The dogs enjoyed the smell of the Deer Off. I really didn't detect any obnoxious odor."
80816,Arrived quickly. Great price. Bulb intensity is slightly off side to side but not bad. Easy to install. The OEM fog lights' lenses had fallen out. These are identical replacements.
80817,"I consider Vikings to be one of the best shows on television right now.  It has great characters, action and storylines.  It's the 'watercooler' show at my office these days.  Definitely worth checking out."
80818,"I recived this guitar today(2/8/13)and its perfect. After I tuned it it sounded great,it plays well,and it does not hurt my fingers like my old guitar. This guitar is amazing!"
80819,"would not fit under table that we bought it for but that was no problem. cut 4 inches off and it fit perfectly and looks wonderful. liked the combination for this base and that umbrella and looked and worked so well we are going to order another one nest week! buy them you will love them! well a week later and we ordered another one-looks great-what a great purchase from amazon. put another feather in my cap, my wire thinks i am smart for ordering from amazon. we liked so much before summer gets here we will have 4 on deck by house and on the swimming pool deck."
80820,"I have had several of these items . I like to have a inverter with a tire pump . Cost was a big factor for me in my younger days . However I now carry this , and a separate air pump that has battery clamps by viar . I am much happier and simply use my generator or a 12 volt led lamp . I used this during the past winter 4 or 5 times to jump start my van with a 351 and it cranked right up from dead after sitting and the charger coming undone . It barely took a charge this spring after I went to charge it after neglecting to do so all winter using it . This will never let you down . I believe it will last years and I love having one in each vehicle for the safety as well as to help others at church or the store that are less fortunate . A great investment and safety item for any family . Pay the extra you will be very happy if starting cars is your main need . Use a viair air pump and buy a battery clip one attachment into a 12 volt plug which will give you the leangh to go around your vehicle and will fill your tires in less then a minute . Do not use the 12 volt outlet for the viair air pump  it can't handle the amps in most cars . This pack is limited to 12 amps output so do not try to  use it either for the air pump unless it is a life and death emergency . When you use those air pumps you need to go off the battery with the car running . Be careful watch where the cord is with the moving parts ."
80821,"Can't Wait to see Season three.  What a great show, it's well acted, well thought out scripts and well just continues along on a high threshold of quality. My wife and I love to watch this show together. We prefer DVD's to television so wait to buy the DVD's then watch the whole season in one shot. This is one show we can hardly wait to see the next season. There are some amazing surprises that are natural progressions for the show to take in this season setting up what I hope is a season 3 that is just as great as the first two. If you like story's about the things that go bump in the twilight this is a great show for you.Ralph J. Fitcher"
80822,It wasn't my cup of tea. I know most romcoms stink but I gave this one a chance. Bad idea.
80823,"I would have given it 5 stars for the information and the show, but the sound quality was lacking. Worth watching."
80824,"This was the first oil change for my 2013 Elantra GT.  I had the i30 in Europe and this is the oil I used there.  The manual says 5W-30 or 20... but this has a wider range.I let the first 2500 miles to go on the original oil.  Just had the oil changed at the dealer and as always, this oil will never fails... you can feel the smooth engine sound and smoother engine grip.  I have a manual so revving the engine in gears i can clearly hear a difference.And by the way, this is the same oil that goes into my A4 for that past 5 years (5 oil changes).  just buy it and never look back."
80825,"This sprinkle says it covers a 50 foot diameter circle, and it does. I like the way the water falls like a rain shower.Sometimes I sit under the sprinkler in my nude-ness. The neighbors love me."
80826,"I compared this to some commercial growth medium from a local nursery, with tomato seeds planted in each. Worked great, no difference in germination or initial growth I could see.I'm also using it in a mix I made for the seedlings once they got started. At about an inch-and-a-half tall I put the seedlings in larger containers. There's only very light fertilizer in this starter mix, .03 - .03 - .03 NPK, to avoid burning the new roots, so for more fertilizer I used a 50/50 mix of this andMiracle-Gro Moisture Control Potting Mix(.21 - .11 - .16 NPK). The extra water retention is also helpful, since seedlings are very sensitive to drying out. That 50/50 mix is the top couple inches of soil. Below that I putMiracle-Gro Garden Soil for Flower and Vegetable, since we don't plant tomatoes outside here until June, and it will set the roots in something a little more suitable for outdoors.The seedlings are doing great in that mixture, with more than twice as much leaf growth as the seedlings that are in the same size containers with the local nursery medium. (When they go into the ground outside they'll get less nitrogen in the fertilizer. Keep in mind that the NPK composition of growth medium and soil cannot be directly compared to that of fertilizer additives, which are a lot more concentrated so they can be diluted in the soil.)The main ingredient is listed as 85-95% sphagnum peat moss, and my bag appears to be about 95%, with few twigs, and just a bit of perlite. The package says it also includes a wetting agent (to help soak in water), along with the light fertilizer listed above."
80827,I have a Ford Five Hundred. I tried three different (read cheaper) brands in a poor attempt to save money. These are the best. They do an excellent job of cleaning the glass evenly withot streaks.
80828,"This is the first electric lawn mower I have ever tried.  One of my neighbors uses an electric lawn mower to mow her lawn, but this is not one for everybody.  This is ideal for someone with a very small lawn.  The advantage of this mower over a gas powered one is that it is very light and you never need to worry about keeping gas on hand to mow the lawn.  The mower seems just a bit louder than a vacuum cleaner when it is cutting the grass (in other words it is very quiet).The set up of the mower was common sense and didn&#8217;t take long at all.  Do not let the plastic construction fool you &#8211; this mower has some power!  I accidentally ran over the kid&#8217;s plastic pail and it destroyed instantly.  I didn&#8217;t think I would run over it and thought it would get pushed to the side when I got near it &#8211; but it got sucked right up and was ruined.The disadvantage is that if you have a large lawn, it will get tiring walking around with the extension cord.  I really don&#8217;t trust myself in using this mower, as I am afraid I will run over the cord.  So this is really only ideal for mowing a small patch of grass if one is diligent enough to keep the cord away and not run over it."
80829,"Unfortunately (Fortunately?) my current home and work habitats appear to be mice free; at least I've seen no signs of them.  Nevertheless, I like the design and think it quite ingenious.  The manufacturer doesn't believe this trap needs to be baited, just properly placed, but the number of reviewers who have reported success with baiting after no success without is enough to give one pause.I'd suggest trying it both ways."
80830,This grill cover is long enough that it truly covers the whole 22.5-inch grill.  I like that it's not a bright color.  Instead it almost disappears once the cover is on.The cover has material that is strong and seems as if it will last as long as my grill.
80831,"I took one star off because this series was abruptly ended after six episodes. Past of this could be due to the fact that at the time of its release in the UK, the market was already saturated with WW II dramas and the series did not get as much critical acclaim as some of the other similar-themed shows Also, the lead writer died, which might have made it difficult for the series to continue. Either way, it's a pity as this is a really well-made film, with a strong ensemble cast.The story is set on the fictitious St. Gregory's Island, which serves as a substitute for the actual British-owned Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey. The period is WW II, when German troops invaded the islands and occupied it for the duration of the war, from 1940-1945. In the series, the story focuses on several plots, revolving around three families: the wealthy Dorrs, made up of the island's Senator, James Dorr (James Wilby) and his wife, Felicity (Clare Holman); the middle class Mahy's comprising father Urban (who dies after being in a bombing raid by the Germans), wife Cassie (Saskia Reves) who runs a grocery store, and their two daughters, Angelique (""Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt) and June (Samantha Robinson); and finally, the blue collar Jonas family made up of police constable Wilf Jonas (Owen Teale), his wife, Kathleen (Julia Ford), and their two young children.The story centers around these three families and their trials and tribulations, and how their lives intersect those of the German occupiers, primarily Baron Heinrich Von Rheingarten (Philip Glenister), the Kommandant in charge of the island; Captain Muller (Daniel Flynn); Oberleutnant Walker (Conor Mullen); Oberleutnant Flach (Andrew Havill); and Airman Bernhardt Tellemann (""Inspector Lewis'"" Lawrence Fox).The series explores some interesting themes such as what was considered fraternizing with the enemy - young June Mahy, who used to sing at the 50/50 Club pre-war finds that her wartime singing at the now German-controlled pub is frowned upon by the locals, and despite not having any sexual relations with German officers, is considered a Jerry Bag, a derogatory term used to refer to women who consorted with German soldiers. Her sister Angelique, despite her aversion to the Germans, finds herself falling for the handsome German navigator, Bernhardt. The girls' mother, Cassie, hates the Germans and blames them for her husband's death, yet finds she too cannot resist the Germans for too long - getting into a business relationship with the German Harbor Master, Wimmel.Meanwhile, the Dorrs are placed in a precarious position when the Baron commandeers their home for his personal residence and office, and discover to their horror, that their young son Stephen, who was assumed to be away fighting in the British Army, has returned on a spying mission for the British.There's also a lot of sexual tension in this series - the Baron is attracted to Felicity, and Wimmel to Cassie, but the most enigmatic and troubling relationship is between Oberleutnant Walker and a beautiful young woman named Zelda Kay (Louisa Clein). Walker develops an unhealthy obsession with Kay despite her thwarting his repeated advances. The man is a brute yet also lonely and craving company and understanding, but goes about things all wrong. This evolution of this relationship was one of the highlights of the series for me.When the series ends after six episodes, several significant plot lines are left unresolved - what happens to Angelique and Bernhardt's relationship? Will their wartime romance survive after the war? Will Walker give up his passion for Zelda and will Zelda ever get away from him? How about Cassie and June? What becomes of them? None of these are addressed with any degree of satisfaction at the conclusion of episode six. I really wish they'd do a wrap up but the show ended in 2003, so I highly doubt it'll be concluded at this point. Still worth viewing in my opinion, and the ensemble cast delivers compelling performances, well worth one's time."
80832,"This was interesting for the series to go from High School to college.  Most of the cast remains and Veronica is on the case again.  The sizzling romance with Logan is rekindled .  The college scene is somewhat believable, but I thought needed a little bit more work.  The last scene was a heartbreaker."
80833,"""Rome"" is my personal favorite miniseries ever.  It has a gritty authenticity that transports the viewer to the Rome of Julius Caesar's time.  The acting is first rate, the storylines are terrific, there is very little not to like about this miniseries.  My favorite aspect of this series is the friendship that develops between Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo (Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson).  The character study of the differences between these two men is really fascinating.""The Stolen Eagle"" is the first episode of the miniseries and one of the best.  Julius Caesar concludes his war in Gaul and must now confront the Senate over his future.  Well, we all know what happens next, but this episode and series make it suspenseful nontheless.Highly recommended.  RJB."
80834,"A surprising look at the life of Linda Lovelace showing the years of abuse she went through with her husband who had forced her into pornography and the not so glamorous side of her fame. Very classily done, never actually showing the film or sex.Amanda Seyfried was phenomenal."
80835,"This gold finch feeder is a blast!  These little cuties do hang upside down to feed and I find it very entertaining to watch.  There is an extra benefit to this feeder...the little holes make it just about impossible for the large birds to steal the food.  Oh yea, the feeder is made out of plastic as well as the perches, but I have absolutely no complaints in regards to the quality of the feeder for the money.  Just use common sense for leaving it out under certain weather circumstances...it cannot tolerate below freezing temperatures."
80836,"Great show, great series.  Sad to see it come to an end. The ending was particularly sad, but not altogether unexpected either."
80837,"I am on ep 9,  and the good hero's are still going strong and some good characters are ..leaving, but being replaced with more great characters and twist.  I am enjoying second season as much as I have enjoyed the first season so far. and hope the rest of the season's are as good.  Kristen bell is in this season, and the guy from the past (Japan 1871) appears to be a great addition.  I love to watch some of the old characters learning more about their past / families, and some characters are not sure what side they are on any more.  Who is the good team, and who is the bad team.  Everyone seems to have their idea on how a hero can save the future.  Someone learns that they have more powers than they thought they had, and are becoming more like their parent with the new found powers.  Think I am addicted.  :("
80838,"I use this on my AWD wheels which are always full of brake dust, grime, crap, etc. You spray this bad boy on for 30sec and then use a good brush to scrub away for about 30sec. Rinse and voila! Wheels look brand spankin new! I could eat off it if I had to! This isn't spray and rinse folks...you will have to put some effort but believe me, you wont be disappointed!"
80839,I like the scenes and the actors in this show. Kinda scary but good scenes. Will watch for more shows.
80840,"This movies really packs a punch; a sociopathic blood thirst mom set on revenge, a viglante cop with his own sense of justice, a psychotic killier son willing to do his mother's bidding, seedy Bang Kok, and intense violent amoral story of greed, corruption, illegal blood sport, and revenge.  Keeps your attention from start to finish."
80841,very awesome item. really useful for tuning. haven't had any problems with it at all so far. Looks very nice
80842,Is a great show and I would highly recommend it to the 'cowboy' or girl in the family.  It mixes the right amount of fun and comedy with serious content.  It has an outlaw element that might not be suited for the younger members.
80843,"This unit works very well, and does so for mice as well. Slight nit-picking in that that LED only notifies for a 24 hour period of a kill. I keep this in my garage, and might not go in for 2-3 days. If there was a kill on the day after I was in, I wouldn't see the light blinking if it was a couple days later. It would've been just as easy to design this with a longer blinking ""Kill"" light. After all LED consumption is very minimal. But this doesn't affect the effectiveness, so it still gets 4 stars!Safe for kids it says on the site here. I guess it is safe in the sense that there are no poisons. The included instructions say to keep away from kids and pets. I imagine it would give a bit of a jolt if they stuck their hand/paw into the trap."
80844,"As soon as I plugged it in I heard a ""pop"". No output. I guess try another inverter and probably another Cobra."
80845,"This is a nifty little device that attaches to your vehicle's OBDII port under the dash. It is adaptable to most vehicles (visit Scangauge's website to be sure yours is on the list). Interestingly, it interfaces via an ethernet port. I used it on a Ford Taurus, A Mercury Grand Marquis, and a Dodge Caravan. Yes, it displays real time MPG data. It also gives you the average time weighted average MPG. RPM, MPH,and TPS data- no problem. Coolant temperature, Ditto. Manifold absolute pressure depends on the vehicle. Same with intake air temperature. It does not give the actual O2 sensor reading, only if the loop is closed or open. It will definitely teach you skills to improve your fuel economy. Surprisingly, the larger your engine the better you will do because you can take advantage of low rpm high torque situations. I got 29.1 MPG with my Grand Mark using it (Averaged over 65 miles in city, highway and country backroads passing Amish Buggies) Philadelphia to Lancaster, PA. I would have given it 5 stars but the materials it is made with are lightweight and I'm not sure if it will stand the test of time. It is a very useful gadget, and it is a shame we can't hook it up to a laptop to send the data to the state DOT to pass emissions inspection. I suggest ScanGauge look into this, it would probably only take a software upgrade, I know the hardware is up to task. I also suggest they encase it in shockproof rubber to protect it.This is a follow up review  5000 miles out from the last review. I revised the unit to 5 stars. Its durability has proven the test of time and jockeying between 3 vehicles. It sits nicely above the wheel of my V8 Grand Marquis with no significant dash obstruction. It maves easily from vehicle to vehicle an is capable of taking a hit bere or there. It would still be nice to have a shockproof rubber case but I upped my rating to 5 stars both because it held up well and it helped me average between 24-28 MPG country in my Grand Mark. It paid for itself in gasoline already. Anything more is gravy now. The only thing I suggest is a list of OBD codes to go with the unit. It is no longer as easy to find them using google because the mechanics and auto makers want to keep this information proprietary. Google OBD and the first 50 entries are either discussion boards, parts suppliers, or sensor makers. The same happens when you seek out a specific code. You have to dig but you can find what they mean. A list would be nice."
80846,"Fairy tale characters like you have never imagined them.  Or, well I never did.:)  I would not recommend for kids under 10.  Some scenes can be a little unsettling."
80847,"Be clear about what you are getting here. This is not a documdrama about actual events. It's a completely fabricated story with fictional characters based on things that happened in the 80's.So you have to enjoy this as a fictional story, not as a dramatized version of reality.That being said the opening episode was really captivating. I mean it's a challenge to get viewers glued to their seats watching 2 nerds hack a bios chip using LED's on a bread board to spell out individual characters in hexidecmial code, but somehow AMC pulled it off!I was so captivated that I kept getting angry when it went to commercial.The lead character (Joe MacMillian, played by Lee Pace) is a complete ass. Sort of like a Don Draper type, and it's a safe bet that AMC is looking to capture that essense with this character since it worked so well in Mad Men. You want to hate him, but you can't help but to be impressed by him.The chief software engineer (Gordon Clark, played be Scoot McNairy) is an everyman's anti-hero. He is a simple family man who most of us can relate to. He has a ton of potential in terms of his computer engineering abilities. But in order to use his talent he has to do something semi illegal by reverse engineering how IBM bios software was written on their proprietary chip. He doesn't intend to just copy IBM's work. He just intends to look at it to see how it's made, similar to a chair maker lookign at another chair to see how it's put together. So you find yourself rooting for him.The female lead (Cameron Howe, played by Mackenzie Davis) is not a well explored character in the pilot so it's hard to see where they are going with her. (The poilot focusses heavily on the engineer) But she is a young college student who the other two need for her software skills.The pilot probably should have been a 2 hour premier event as I feel like they crammed too much into the 1 hour episode to get the story arc kicked off. I expect the later episodes to devle into detail a bit more.Its just an interesting story that's VERY well acted and VERY well filmed that is well worth an hour of your time to try out.Update after Episode 2...They explored the Cameron Howe character a lot more in this episode. She's still a bit of a mystery as far as her back story, but they open up her current life more. She's a scared kid with a ton of potential who's pretending to be self assured and confident. She is aware that she knows computers (both software and hardware) better than anyone else she is working with. But she also is aware that she knows nothing about the computer business, which is the driving force for everything she is doing.And she is aware that she is in the middle of something that could either make her a millionaire or get her thrown in jail but she doesn't have control over her fate. She just has to play her roll in the whole Bios/PC development process and hope it works out on her favor. So she's scared and she tries to hide that by overcompensating her exterior toughness. She is a very interesting character and Mackenzie Davis, who plays the role, her really sells those emotions.Joe MacMillian (Main guy) has his past vulnerabilities eluded to as well, which deepens his character.The season is through Episode 4 as I update this now....The show continues to be good. The fun part about it is that the underlying plot (people building a computer) isn't a surprise at all. There are no shockers there because you know what is going to happen. You know that they are going to build a computer than is smaller, faster, cheaper than IBM's because you know this actually happened in real life and this is a story dramatizing those events. (With totally fictitious characters and companies). Yet somehow, even though you know exactly what they are trying to build, you end up riveted to the show wondering how it's all going to unfold.The computer building is just the underlying plot though. The real drama is in the characters and how they interact."
80848,"Onion News Empire is a very witty satire of the news media.  Some of the humor is just plain ludicrous, but some is simpy exaggeration of what really goes on in today's reporting business.  There's a lot of room for this show to grow."
80849,"Works to get the filters off when there's nothing else. Doesn't tend to slip off and makes a good grip on the oil filter. It does dent and deform the filter though, so I only use it to take oil filters off."
80850,Kept our camp rug in place for 10 days with a ton of traffic and 20-30 mph wind. It sure beats the rocks and things we have used over the years!
80851,This is a terrific series. The characters and cast playing them are all top shelf as a whole. They do a great job of mixing just enough life with work life into the relationships and you really feel connected with the characters and the writing. The subject content really is compelling with such a great human element in the resolutions they try to bring into situations.. A+ 10
80852,"Miracle-Gro, brand name trusted by many for years! I lost the old nozzle years ago and just could never find one until this one came along I got all excited again! YES! Nearly identical to the one I had, it feeds your plants accordingly and never too much and never too little; always the right amount; plus the spray nozzle that attached to any garden hose with the dial to water and feed or water only makes gardening life easier!"
80853,"Joe and the bots are put through a grueling ordeal w/ LOST CONTINENT. They hang on for dear life during the interminably-long ""mountain climbing"" sequence that consumes nearly half the movie's running time w/ climbing... Climbing... CLIMBING! A dinosaur (aka: a tiny lizard filmed from below) is glimpsed, but even it leaves out of boredom. Finally, a stop-motion brontosaurus lumbers forth, only to be filled w/ lead! So little action takes place, that Joel nearly lapses into a coma! Luckily, through the wonders of MST3K technology, this film is rendered (nearly) harmless. Let us thank these brave lads..."
80854,very interesting exciting film keeps viewers at the edge of their seats. Good movie to watch dont miss out on it
80855,"I've had a lot of imitation leatherish wheel covers that a) smell and b) don't last very long.  I can't swear that this is real leather or not, but it doesn't stink like others that I've had, and so far, in about the 4 months I've had it, it's holding up well.  So far so good."
80856,I'm one of those guys who stops and helps people when they need it.  While not a pro recovery guy I use my cables more than the average person.  These fit the bill just right. Strong clamps with a long cable that stays pliable in the cold.
80857,"I had to make some adjustments on the neck of my Martin d-28 and remove the bridge pickup. This left the saddle too low to the neck.  I researched the ""Tusq"" products and found enough people impressed to give it a try.  I'm pleased to say I find more ring through the body and a better sustain.  I'll do this to my other acoustics as time goes on."
80858,"I used for 1 day and and it destroyed itself with a pine needle.  Now I get streaks where the pine needle, or any other item I assume, has been dragged. So unless you are meticulous and clean your blades before you use them everyday and or get out of your car and clean them immediately anytime any item may fall onto your window, do not buy these.  Unless you do not mind streaks.  The damage is permanent, not only when the item is still on the window."
80859,"It did get rid of my wasp problem, so I was happy about that, but the range of the spray was much shorter than conventional wasp and hornet spray, so you do have to get closer to the nest to spray. The foam does seem to help if you get a direct hit on the wasps themselves, but if you are spraying the outside of the nest, do not expect the foam to stay up there, it will fall right back down.Works, but there might be better solutions"
80860,"Great bargain price. 3 great vocal microphones, in its own protective case, with its own holders. Not top end ... but for general purpose use and abuse ... works just fine. Sensitivity and clarity is more than acceptable for my needs. Feels quite solid."
80861,"Works great to soften up & protect leather seats. Be sure to allow plenty of time for it to dry before sitting on the seats to protect your clothes from residue. At first the leather will feel greasy after applying the conditioner, but that feeling goes away once the conditioner soaks in and dries fully. Works great on leather shift knobs & steering wheels too!"
80862,"I love Greys Anatomy but this latest season has begun to unravel. The rivalry between Grey and Yang is particularly annoying after all their years of friendship. And, the chief's illness seems to have been a contrived way of getting him some attention. Most annoying is the endless soap opera with Sarah Drew's character. As a doctor her character has always been iffy. Her personal life, contorted by her religious devotion, is even more annoying, because it stands out among the doctors like a sore thumb: as if the writers were saying, &#34;we really don't believe in all this mumbo -umbo but we have to be sensitive to this particular voting block.&#34; I'm just hoping they pull it all together in the second semester."
80863,"This is very nice holder which holds my guitar in an accesible but safe from scratching place.  the mount screws were too low of quality to use though, I went and got my own mount screws (was able to use black ones that matched - better) as these did not work that well and I did not want to trust my expensive guitar to them."
80864,"the knobs seem very easy to over tighten, I haven't done it yet but I'm planning on treating this stand with the utmost care so as not to have any surprises when I put my expensive PA speaker on it"
80865,"Nothing flashy or gimmicky, just a solid cop show with a compelling cast and fine writing. I'll keep watching. Bravo Amazon."
80866,"This is a useful tool for streak-free cleaning smooth surfaces such as windows, counter tops, shower stalls and doors, car windows, glass doors, etc. Easy to use, just charge, spray cleaner on your surface and go. I have arthritis and this is easier on your arms, shoulders, and neck than paper towels with window cleaner. I would like to see a longer battery life and a extension option, but still love this tool.Highly recommend as it does the work for you."
80867,"This soundhole cover is one of those products that belongs on the list of essentials for an acoustic guitar player, right up there with a tuner, string winder/cutter, cleaning cloth, pack of extra picks, and capo. It's designed to eliminate feedback when plugged into a sound system, which it does nicely. It's also great for sealing up the body of your guitar if you want to dry it out or dampen it quickly (as in 2 nights like that in a case)."
80868,"It starts with an amusing (though slightly racist) premise and then devolves into something very mean-spirited.  It's more of a collection of funny bits than a cohesive story.  Other characters enter and exit the story inexplicably, and for little reason.  The movie had a great start and does explore the theme of greed rather interestingly, but the end result is a movie that could have been much better."
80869,"Firm picking surface but flexible body so feels a bit more natural than a rigid pick. They are slightly larger than a normal dunlop pick but much the contoured body makes it much easier easy to hold, I can play all night without dropping it."
80870,"Lately there have been a lot of movies about the Roman Empire's reach into the British Isles.  There was the King Arthur retelling with Clive Owen and Keira Knightley.  And soon after that was Colin Firth in the Last Legion.  Now we have Centurion, about a group of surviving roman centurions who struggle to reach friendly ground after their legion is destroyed by Picts.  Combining great scenery, bloody violence, raucous humor with betrayals and backstabbing, this movie shows life in the Roman Empire as brutal and bloody.  And yes, we have warrior babes, more than in previous sword-fighting movies.  The soundtrack was a disappointment; for a movie with scenery and cinematography like LOTR, the background music was totally forgettable.  Outside of that, this was an above-average action flick."
80871,My aunt the music teacher recommended this metronome and we really like it. It's been in heavy use (1+ hours per day) ever since we got it many months ago and I don't think we've even had to replace the batteries yet. It's got a good loud sound and is easy for my kids to adjust. We tried out some free metronome apps but the volume wasn't loud enough and my kids (though very adept at touch screens) found them tricky to adjust. This one is great.
80872,"So far so Good! All the bulbs worked out of the package. Brighter and whiter than the incan. OEM bulbs. replaced the following on the Prius:front side marker (2)lic. plate (2)front map and dome lights (3)door lights (2)Only time will tell if it will last or if will be safe for my plastics. I believe this smaller LED size will be fine. There are larger and more powerful versions out there. But, you run the risk of the bulb generating too much heat and melting the plastic."
80873,I just ordered three different guitar straps online. One for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself. Then I found this and decided to get it. The $5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff. I got this and switched over. Ahhh this is a guitar strap! I see why you pay more. It is so soft and comfortable. It looks AMAZING! This is just a great product. I would highly recommend it to anyone and am proud to use it on my guitar. Thanks!
80874,This movie is not too far from the future if we don't change something soon.  I will probably watch this a few more times.
80875,What more can you ask of a wiper blade?  It went on easily and did a perfect job of clearing the windshield.
80876,"I've watched and rewatched this fantastic 3D movie.Its one of the ones I have company watch,great 3D,visually stunning with all the underwater scenes. I prefer the nature 3D blue rays over the full length movies and this is one of the best."
80877,Only Lasted 2yr.  I have a lot of cheaper cables that get more use/abuse than this one that have outlasted it.
80878,"This was my original review:All of my ladybugs were alive when I received them!  They were beautiful.  I bought them because I am having a problem with white flies in my lawn, and other aphids on some of my plants.They arrived quickly.  They were packaged well with a refrigerate pack to make sure that did not get too hot.  They came with a sheet of wonderful instructions.  They also came with a small pack of nectar to sprinkle out with them to help keep them nearby.  But, I also ordered the larger bag of it when I order these.I was very happy with this transaction.THIS IS MY ADDITIONAL REVIEW:These lady bugs are Asian lady bugs.  They are not native.  They do bite when their food source gets low; as in late in the year.  They become aggressive.  I had several bites.  I could not believe it!  Then, I did some research on line and found out.  Asian ladybugs also eat the larvae of native ladybugs. You are much much better off getting lacewings.  I bought those too, and they worked great!  And they will not bite you or kill beneficial insects."
80879,"I'd stripped out the threads on my travel trailer's battery.  I needed something to left my disconnect the power without disconnecting the cables.  The ""Little Switch"" did the trick.  First I'd like to say that not all of these types of switches come with a mounting bracket.  This one does which seems like a no brainer, but in the era of ""not enough dollars = not enough sense"" in manufacturing you have to be careful.  I'm pleased that it is also a weather resistent swicth which is also not always the case, even amount marine swicthes.  The weather cap slides over the key hole when the key is out.  There is also a water / dust cover the fits on the key for use when the key is ""in"", however that's a little tricky to get on.  All mounting and wiring nuts and hardware has been included.  So far, it's doing it's job, battery is holding it's voltage just as if it was disconnected."
80880,"Last evening Mrs. Spudman asked me to loosen a bolt on her new sewing machine. I couldn't budge it using the tiny screwdriver included with the machine. Using my long-handled screwdriver, I turned the bolt easily. Therein lies part of the secret of the special performance of the Fiskars PowerGear lopper - its long handle. I may have earned a D in physics back in the day, but I know what works - like this pair of loppers and my long handles Fiskars ax. Both are marvelous.The head of the Fiskars lopper is encased in a clear plastic cover that I removed using the pictogram instructions. These pictograms are often used in Fiskars products to convey directions. The hard plastic cover may be kept on the loppers during storage, but judging from my past history, I'm likely to lose it.Owning four pairs of loppers presently, including a smaller pair of Fiskars, and having owned countless pairs previously, I'm not new to loppers and the lavish promises made by promoters. My former favorite Corona loppers are supposed to have 3x power; they perform well though I've never been convinced of their super power.These long-handled Fiskars are the real deal. I used these loppers for several hours to test them out, cutting live and dead branches both. With each cut I was amazed and awed. No other lopper I've ever used comes close to the smoothness and power of these loppers. They are comfortable to use and don't require the back straining effort of other loppers, even on those 2 inch plus cuts. Even cutting branches above my head that required full arm extension was a breeze. I never would have considered paying this much for a pair of loppers, but having used the Fiskars 9482 32-Inch Quantum Hand Lopper, Id have to say they are worth every penny.The power gear mechanism of these loppers works smoothly, unlike the clumsy ratcheting systems I've experienced with other loppers. This patented gearing mechanism ""makes cutting effortless."" Yes, it really does.The blade has a polymer coating for corrosion resistance, the cork handle is light and supportive, and the aluminum alloy used in the loppers' construction is strong yet light. A full lifetime warranty backing the product is a nice bonus.If you go to the Fiskars site, there's precious little about how to maintain these loppers or buying a replacement blade in the future. It's best to clean the blade with rubbing alcohol after each use to maintain the lopper blade and prevent spreading disease. There are many You Tube videos that address sharpening and oiling your lopper to keep it in good condition."
80881,Works great but like a previous post said it does leave little read waxy fibers on your vehicle. Makes quick work for a dust job on my truck
80882,"I love this show! Season 3 takes a little bit more of a dark turn, but the great writing and witty dialogue keeps the show likeable."
80883,"This peddle works great! I looked at many products for, just the right distortion and this one just topped them all. So glad I went with the M116"
80884,"As movies of this genre go, this one probably really only deserves 3 stars, but James Purefoy pushes it to 4. I was a little disappointed that the movie was not quite as good as the trailer."
80885,"Used this as an upgrade to my shadow ace short oil filter. Was looking for an economical oil filter but not compromising on performance. This has a trusted name on it, well made and a great alternative."
80886,"I absolutely loved this show. I see it has been listed as a cult thing and I'm not sure what that means. I'm a very senior Senior so my interest may be surprising but I had a hard time doing anything else until I'd finished watching the last episode. All the good things said about this series are true--I was just very disappointed to learn that it was ending with this season. I have recommended it highly to several friends, but haven't heard their feedback yet. What a gem!"
80887,"These are not likely to be investigated and messed with by a kid or a pet (cat or a dog), can kill multiple mice at once (up to 12), and can be used both indoors and outdoors.I like that these come pre-loaded and are disposable. With this product, you can just kill all the mice and never need to touch the poison.They eat the poison from the station and die elsewhere. The biggest problem with this product and with poisoning mice (besides the inhumane treatment of poisoning mice) is that cats or dogs cat then eat the dead mice and then the pets die that way. Although this product is good at making sure that children and other pets do not get to the poison, the fact that the mice will die somewhere in the house and might be then eaten by your pets who will then die is scary.Also, it should be noted that although 12 seems like a large number, mice tend to exist in large families so one of these stations might not solve the problem in your house or barn."
80888,"I'm partial to Samurai and Kung Fu movies, but whether or not that was the case, I still loved this movie.  Nothing is better than a gritty tale of correcting injustice.  This movie did an excellent job of pulling you in to the actual plight and the motive of the 13 assassins.  There wasn't a lot of special effects to rely upon, and as a subtitled movie, the dialogue was concise and good at conveying the plot.  I especially loved the speech given to the Samurais as they were training:  &#34;If you don't have a sword use a stick... if no stick use a rock... you'll die but make the enemy feel pain.&#34;  It's not a precise quote, but those are some very inspirational words."
80889,"I have had mine for 3 years now and love it. The assembly is minimal and the seasoning prcedure makes all the parts stay in great shape. I do a fair amount of smoking of meats (weekly) and it has been performing well. I have not modified it and manage the internal heat by using the right amount of charcoal and monitoring the unit every 20-30 minutes. Having worked with experienced Pit Masters, they all say the same thing. You have to pay attention to your fire, lift the lid as little as possible, monitor the temp, add more as needed. The only downside, true for all the water-smokers (hence 4 instead of 5) is adding can be challenging but not impossible. Patience is required. Would I buy it again, yes. Most of my smoking is done between 200-225F, and it does from ribs and whole turkeys very well. Even smoked a meatloaf! MMMMMMMMMM"
80890,"I had heard good things about Awkward, and tried it on Prime. I can see it skewing to a (younger) MTV crowd, but found it very enjoyable. A bit soapy (but a lot of shows are), Ashley Rickards as Jenna is immensely appealing and relate able. Her problems are universal (how can I be popular/cool, which boy should I be with, why does she hate me, why is my Mom such a spazz?) and have changed little over the years. The show is also realistic about sex, treating it as natural, messy, and fraught with emotion (even if you're not &#34;serious&#34; yet). I've started on season two, which develops personalities nicely, sophomore year is different, after all. Some unoriginal stereotypes, the ditzy boy crazy BFF, the Asian pal with the overbearing parents, but the characters aren't to blame for that and still manage to be fun. A big thumbs up......"
80891,"I enjoyed the first season of Whitechapel and the story line in the second season is just as engaging, except I enjoyed it even more that the first because over time we get to know the characters much better and begin to understand and care more about them."
80892,"There's a line from an old John Wane movie where he sais, &#34;I lack sufficient flow of words.&#34; I find myself in the same situation here; this is a great series, And I can't praise it enough. The only drawback is that it's in German, with subtitles. But the pure power of the characters and their performances totally overcomes that small 'ding'.Very much worth a watch. See it with a friend and share a good bottle of wine with your favorite hors d'oeuvre's."
80893,"I followed the instructions TO THE LETTER, and my headlights look the same as they did before!  This product did not work at all for me!"
80894,Not sure about this one. We watched it but doubt we'll ever re-watch it. It did fit right into the series however so if you like that as we do...it's worth watching but not a must watch. In otherwords you can live without it and not miss much as in background etc. I'd recommend if you are a huge fan of the series but I wouldn't push it or even bring it up to others unless it came up in a conversation for some reason. Sort of a shrug from the old shoulder comes to mind kind of movie. Then again...some people just want more even if it's not fully delivered it does give some more and it isn't all bad...just not great. Three stars is just right.
80895,I store my picks in there and I put it by my table. It's a sturdy pick holder and it gets the job done.
80896,The show is off to an interesting start.  Titus Welliver is his usual solid self and does a great job in the lead.  The jury is still out on whether or not the writing will develop enough to hold one's interest in a time when there is SO much to watch of high quality but I'm hoping that it does evolve into a five star show.
80897,"This is an excellent lint free towel that's perfect for a multitude of tedious areas.Thin and manageable ~ yet super absorbent, this waffle towel is ideal for fragile and fine glasswareand so much more.I washed up several items in our china cabinet, some delicate old wine glasses, and small cordial liqueur glasses.The towel completely absorbs water instantly with light contact, and leaves a sparkling shine.Their also great for car care. Caught a 50 degree winter day and washed the salt off our car.I used these towels to detail the windows an mirrors, they did a perfect job without leaving lint or streaking ~ on one pass.I must say ~ the more I use these towels ~ the more impressed I am with them.Size is 12"" x 24"" (washed)  Use only non chlorine bleach."
80898,"Premise of movie was excellent in the beginning...Acting satisfying...Then...towards end of movie they HOLLYWOODIZED it and FLOP...If you don't mind a typical, sensationalized ending, or if your just starting your thriller/horror journey this can entertain you...."
80899,"I have 1.5 acres and am a 61 year old female.  I can't do the entire yard using the gas weed eater, wears out my arms and the vibration does my hands in.  I LOVE this weed eater.  It's light, doesn't vibrate, and does a good job on the grass and weeds.  Big thing to remember is that you don't have to tap this to get the string to feed out.  It's a self-feeding string and this has worked flawlessly.  It's nice not to have to stop and tap, or pull out string when it gets stuck, or any of the other pain in the neck string problems you get with other weed eaters.  The batteries last about 20 minutes, and when they're out of juice they stop all at once.  We have other equipment that uses the same lithium battery so I have 4 of them.  It takes 3 batteries to do my entire yard.  They recharge in about 6 hours.As for the string, I buy the pre-strung spools at Lowes.  One could probably just buy the string and rewind the spool if one had the time and inclination.  I don't.  I couldn't say how long they last, but they last for quite a while."
80900,Low Low Budget stinker. The special effects are terrible. The acting is ridiculous. The story is boring. I loved Nude Nuns With Big Guns but this movie is not even in the same league as Nude Nuns. Done waste your money.
80901,This mic is fine. One should know that it has quite low gain and requires the use of a boost/preamp for the guitar sound to be heard.
80902,This is a nice product and did exactly as I expected it would. My lights went from yellow and dull to crystal clear. However I did not expect that it would take as much effort as it did. The light has to be sanded three different times with three different grades of sandpaper and then an additional once over with a fine sanding cream.Like I said my expectations were that it would be very quick and easy and maybe I had unrealistic expectations. The reality is it is fairly easy but takes closer to an hour to do properly. I would certainly use this product again and I would recommend it.
80903,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MississippiThat's Foley's (Samuel L. Jackson) new monto, ""Nothing changes unless you make it change.""&#8200;He should know. He's spent the last 25 years in prison for killing his partner and best friend,Up until that moment he was one of the best grifters around. He had business savvy and knew how to work a con the smart way.Now that he's finally getting out, Foley is determined to change.But there's a problem. Ethan (Luke Kirby) the son of his former partner wants to be a grifter, he wants to learn from the best and he won't take ""no"" for an answer.He's got a mark, his boss Xavier (Tom Wilkinson) and claims with Foley's help they can take him for eight million.Foley has met a young woman Iris (Ruth Negga) and feels he's got a real chance of leaving his old life behind. Ethan won't give up and finally get's his way, when he forces Iris into the mix.The Samaritan is an OK&#8200;movie, that could have been a great movie. It has two major things going for it. First, Samuel L. Jackson - the way he rolls his eyes, that road-weary persona, that determination not to go back to jail but a necessary convincing flip-flop when they include the woman he loves. Second, The Samaritan is a good con movie. You constantly find yourself trying to figure out who is conning who, or if anyone can be trusted at all.The downside is the film tries to balance too many themes in 90 minutes, worth a look but forgettable."
80904,"A truly enjoyable series.  I have watched and enjoyed nearly all 3 seasons of episodes.  I really enjoy the employees when they are doing their best under adverse circumstances.  Many have had real issues in their lives to overcome and to see how they perform exceptional work and really enjoy their jobs is a thrill.  No matter how low or high the position they hold, they bring a strong spirit and love of life to all who work with them."
80905,Great replacement and works well.  I will buy another to have a spare for my 36 year old Ford RV
80906,"What started as a five star (or at least a 4 1/2) devolved into a three star.  I love period pieces and especially this era, so I began with excitement and high expectations.  By the third episode I realized that it was almost as if they said...ok, the first two episodes are great, but we've only got one episode left, so we've got to tie up all of these loose ends quickly.  And that is what it feels like...rushed at the end just to get everything in."
80907,"&#34;It was fun, it was always fun with Lumpy. He was the first real friend I ever had.&#34; Lumpy (Labine) is Scott's (Long) best friend and best man at his wedding. When he gets a little out of control Scott tells him to go sleep it off so he doesn't ruin the wedding. The next day everyone is shocked at Lumpy's death and now Scott and his new wife are arranging his funeral instead of honeymooning. When they begin to tell Lumpy's friends about what happened they discover a man they never knew. This is one of the biggest surprises I have ever found in terms of movies. I expected this to be funny for two reasons...Justin Long and Tyler Labine. Those guys are so funny without trying to be that I was looking forward to laughing many times even with the subject matter. What I found out was that not only was I wrong about laughing the entire time but I cried at the end. Labine was a great choice because he is so likable and even though he is only in the movie off and on his presence is felt and that impacts everything. I can not say enough about this movie and I want everyone I know to watch it. It does have moments where I did laugh, it's not morbid even though the plot revolves around death, and the most important thing this movie has is heart without coming off as unbelievably cheesy. This is a near perfect movie and I can't recommend this enough. I loved it. I give this an A+."
80908,"Great concept,  interesting writing, perfect balance of action, adventure, intrigue, loss, mystery,  well... it has it all and I mean it all. Black List has James Spader! I watched this show to see James Spader. Even if it had not been the excellent show that it is I would still have watched the show to see James Spader! He could have carried the Teletubbies to prime time."
80909,"I have owned this thing for years.  It is hands-down my all-time favorite gardening tool.  I used to use your old-school loppers which became tiring to use and had trouble cutting thick branches.  I was in Home Depot one day and decided to spend the big bucks and get this thing.  It was my first Fiskars purchase ever, and ever since then I have been SOLD on this company.  These loppers are AMAZING.  I can cut branches, even tree roots, thicker than ever before with ease.  The gears on this thing make it possible to use this for a long period of time without tiring your arms as much.  Very efficent and effective tool.  Easily my favorite most-effective gardening tool I've ever bought.  I highly recommend this to you if you are in the market for some loppers.  Or if you know someone who likes to mess around the yard (especially older folks - this is so much easier on the joints), then get this as a gift.  It's just the best!** UPDATE 12/11/2102 **I just bought this as a gift for someone this Christmas. They work outdoors around the house and actually were using these same loppers, but they were 16 years old at that point (the loppers, not the person!).  They hadn't cared for them or sharpened them and they are in really bad shape.  So - a replacement is what they're getting for Christmas!  I do still love these things!"
80910,Overall I loved the movie and Josephine was amazing! I couldn't stand the little sister character.. such a spoiled brat who should be locked in a cage.
80911,"I bought couple these for my dad and he loves them, put out high quality light and efficient cost and low watts per unit. Highly recommended for the price, BEST for 2-3 smaller house plants."
80912,"Great drama.  Take a trip back to the 80's and enjoy a Russian spy couple adjusting to the multiple challenges of raising teens, infidelity and fulfilling their mission.  It's a warped version of leave it To Beaver where Ward and June are bad...very bad."
80913,"This show became one of my new favorites in the first season and I was very excited about the second.  The season started out strong but a little more than half way through their was some backsliding not just in the show plot but in the characters.  The first half of the season was great.  Zoe made a choice between George and Wade and embarked on an adult relationship and seemed to be growing as a person as did her chosen guy and many other characters.  I looked forward to the show every week until the middle of the season when everything changed.  Zoe's relationship was over all of the sudden in the span of 2 episodes and Zoe went back to being the immature woman who makes stupid choices that she almost instantly regrets.  It was the first half of the first season all over again.  I get that the writers and producers need to shake things up sometimes to keep a show interesting, but that is not what they did.  They turned it all over on its head and not in a good way.  The season thankfully ends on a high note that gives great hope for season 3.  For everyone else who loves this show, don't give up yet.  Hopefully the writers and producers will realize their mistake and go back to the way it was before."
80914,this thing looks great in the box. its almost time to start using it. I hope it works as well as it looks
80915,"This show is always funny.  It doesn't let up on the crazy.  After all the seasons, its funny how the characters just grow on you.  I think its actually getting better."
80916,"This fits my 1998 323is, but Amazon shows it as not compatible.  However, the same filter from other suppliers on Amazon show as compatible.  So check other sites for the part number that fits your vehicle.This is a good price and convenient with Amazon Prime.  I used to have to plan weeks ahead for oil changes to wait for it to arrive, or keep a spare on hand."
80917,"I suffered through 3 episodes of this show with an acid-filled stomach, and then it became too much for me to bear. I do watch other crime-solving shows, but there was something just insidiously....evil about this one. I understand on an intellectual level that the premise of the show is clever, but it wasn't enough to overcome the disturbing feeling that stayed with me for hours after I watched an episode. I cannot POSSIBLY be the only ex-viewer who felt that way. Films and TV shows are getting more and more disgusting and extreme, to the point where I wonder if Hollywood will make actual ""snuff"" films sometime in the not-too-distant future, in order to maintain the sick thrill for the viewer. This is one show that will have to go on without me."
80918,"I am an old Doctor Who fan from way back and the new Doctor Who is the best. Last season the Doctor had to fake his death, but this season he is back with Amy and Rory. Things are not going well but they all work together to solve a series of serious problems. Back and strong as ever in the ""helping humanity"" department the Doctor still has it this season. Come and watch!"
80919,"Finally, there are some absolutely gorgeous, glass hummingbird feeders available for your garden instead of the cheap, plastic ones of the past.  I got the blue one and now I want one of each color.  These are quality, sturdy feeders, beautifully made, easy to clean.  Can't really ask for more!  The hanger is made of metal, there ae 4 red feeding ports on a shiny metal base, 16 oz capacity, and the antique glass bottle with unique square shape.  It's easy to use, easy to clean, easy to fill, and beautiful to look at."
80920,"As we all know, the best Gordon Ramsay video is an uncensored video.  From what I'm seeing in these reviews, this DVD is censored!  No way!  I'm not buying it if it's censored.  Why would his first seven seasons be ""raw & uncensored"", and now season 8 is censored?  Nope!  I'm not buying this DVD."
80921,"The Nooski mouse trap looks promising - the idea is that when the mouse enters the trap to take the bait, it will nudge a lever that releases a rubber ring that tightens around its neck, killing it. The trap is reasonably easy to set.In my initial review, I maligned the Nooski because the bait cup was empty but I saw no mouse.  But on disassembly, I saw that the ring was gone. (I later realized that you can see the ring without disassembly if the trap has not sprung.) So the trap did spring, and there is, somewhere, a mouse with a green collar, but I have not found him yet.The Nooski works, but, as other reviewers have commented, it does not always kill instantly. That the rings are single use and need to be restocked is perhaps a disadvantage, especially if you have lots of mice, but you get 10 rings with the trap so perhaps that's not so bad.Edit: November 27, 2012A second mouse was ""dispatched"" by the Nooski a day after the first mouse tripped it. This one didn't get too far - maybe three feet or so.  Unlike spring traps, the killed mouse may not be nearby. A point my wife made - she is used to taking trap-killed mice outdoors for feral cats, etc. to eat. Can't do that with the Nooski because of the ring, though I suppose one could snip it off...."
80922,Awesome season. I have all three seasons.I will be getting season four when it comes out. Very good acting and story line.
80923,interesting characters and stories.
80924,I started watching this show when it first started and I got hooked.  It's an interesting story with compelling characters and just enough mystery to keep you coming back.
80925,"The subject matter is well worth the time invested. I perhaps grew weary watching the actors portraying these early robber barons look pensively out the window of their lushly decorated offices, but for the most part the actors conveyed the required drive and ruthlessness of their characters."
80926,"I can't fathom a fly catching product working any better. We experienced a few flies in the house this Spring so we purchased this product. In less than one week, this product caught over two hundred flies. What is kind of funny is that this product attracts flies to it...who knew there were that many flies around my house. While the product captures many flies, it also attracts them.  Flies that were not necessarily a problem were captured. Day one a few flies are trapped, and each subsequent day--- by the fifth day, the amount of flies caught was unimaginable. I am going to rid the entire neighborhood of flies at this rate. I am going to stockpile this product."
80927,"The Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap is small and attractive, and can easily be placed where fruit flies are a problem. You pour the included bottle of bait into the trap, which contains a ""funnel"" that makes it difficult for flies to escape.  The flies are attracted to the scent of the bait and drown in it.However...  The bait is simply the classic solution of vinegar and detergent, plus some red coloring (which is for your benefit, not the flies'.)  After 30 days you are supposed to toss the whole thing and buy another.  The trap does not come apart, so you can't just clean it out and refill it. At least it is designed so that you can see how well it is working, but if you have a severe infestation, you would probably go through a bunch of these.  If you don't mind a lower-tech solution, just fill a shallow dish with apple cider vinegar and add a few drops of dish detergent - you'll accomplish the same thing and spend a lot less."
80928,"As much a I love Mark Strong, this series is just not one I could connect to.  I tried.  Several episodes under the belt and the only thought that came to mind was, &#34;Good chance I could find something better to spend money on...&#34;  Degenerate cops going after degenerates is not new territory in TV, but I just wanted to see them all go away.  A better title might have been, &#34;No Winter Sun&#34;.  I gave it a '2' for a couple of good actors who chose a bad project, IMO."
80929,"I own and use a LOT of bird feeders at our place.  We are year-around feeders and living on five acres of wooded property, orchard, garden and specifically planted area for just birds we have a very, very large following.  We also have approximately 35 to 40 squirrels who take advantage; squirrels being squirrels you know.  Anyway, we are using and have used in the past, quite a large number of various models of Perky-Pet feeders.  I must tell you truthfully that for the most part we have been delighted with each of these feeders.  They are cost effective, easy to clean, and most importantly, the birds are attracted to them and use them.Alas, I suppose you cannot bat a 1000 and Perky-pet most certainly struck you with this particular offering.  I like the concept and the feeder is attractive and the birds sort of like it but the flaws far out weigh the goodness of this feeder.To begin with, this thing is far, far, far from being squirrel proof and is indeed not even designed to discourage squirrels.  As a matter of fact they hit this thing within one hour after we installed it and within two hours had completely emptied it.  In addition to that the greedy little guys had made wonderful progress in removing the plastic &#8216;windows.&#8221;  We removed the feeder.This feeder does hold a lot of food but loading it is a true pain.  The top must be pressed down tightly and if you are just a fraction off in your alignment, a screwdriver or some other implement must be used to get the thing off again.  Overall the design of this thing is absolutely wretched.  What on earth were these folks thinking?  I am amazed that a company that offers so many fine products would come up with something like this.On the other hand, with the exception of the plastic &#8216;windows&#8221; this thing should last quite a few years...it is metal and has some sort of rust protector.  The problem is I simply do not have the time (with all of our other feeders to maintain,) to wrestle with the top of this thing each time I fill it or take it down for its frequent cleaning.I am sorry this product is below standard as the idea is great and it is attractive and I am sure the birds would eventually like it if the squirrels left anything for them...fat chance of that happening.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"
80930,The leveler works great for our 5th wheel. We went camping and we used these. Better then using blocks. The camper didn't move. We put them under the legs. For winter we will put them under the tires.
80931,"I use the 21' cable. Great build quality, looks professional, sturdy plugs, and most importantly it sounds great! I like the smooth fabric sleeve, it doesn't stick to things like a plastic/rubber cable can."
80932,"This is made for raw or shell less peanuts. Peanuts in shells will fit but are frustrating to the birds as they're too large for grate.It took nearly 4 weeks before I had activity on this feeder despite having two nearby (10ft away but in line of sight) brome feeders for my 40+ golden finches wintering in Florida and 10+ other regular visitors suh as cardinals and red bellied woodpeckers.  Things changed a week ago - now the red bellied woodpecker swacks at me when I'm grilling as it was apparently interfering with his feeding time. On a daily this feeder is visited by 3 red bellied woodpeckers, 2 blue jays, and the occasional female cardinal."
80933,"I'm pretty OCD about my cars and scratching up the paint - these sponges are super soft! Nothing like a &#34;normal&#34; sponge, and almost feels like it's not doing much cleaning-wise. Anyway, if you want a sponge you can use when washing the car and don't want to worry about scratching the paint, this is the one!"
80934,"The gloves appear to be very well made from quality leather and are nice and warm. I ordered extra large and they're tight on me but I can wear them. Order the next size up and you should be okay. I don't think they come in 2XL, so if you wear XL, expect them to be tight. I applied Lexol leather conditioner and Neatsfoot oil and that softened the leather and allowed the gloves to stretch a little. The price was definitely a bargain."
80935,"Really like this tv series. I've watched it from the very beginning and have enjoyed every episode. The Characters have such chemistry that it makes the show great, believable and fun to watch. I love Auggie and Annie!!!"
80936,"No one wanted to believe it, but it's obvious that Chris Carter is pretty much done as a creative mind. Similar to Kohan/Mutchnick, there's no diversity in the storytelling, so all we remember is that one hit. Just finished it, would not watch this anymore.Usually pilots can have a slow build and get stronger. This started strong and got worse. Get Aldis Hodge and Adrian Pasdar better vehicles please. Pass."
80937,"I used this on my leather office chair.  Works as advertised.  Goes on thick like honey, rub it in with a clean towel, then wipe off any excess with another towel.  I am happy this product."
80938,"Just as in season 1, I enjoyed the cast of characters, interesting plot and all the trappings of a 1950s setting.  Colors, costuming, cinematography--excellent.Season 1 was more entertaining and interesting in terms of character development and storyline, but I was still entertained and would have luved to see another season.  This drama was headed somewhere more intense/dark than where it started, and I wonder if that's what killed it in the end?Side Note:  The quite sporadic, extremely graphic violence was as off-putting as it was completely gratuitous and unnecessary.  Reminded me of when a kid learns a new magic trick he has to show it off all the time.Comments about characters--spoiler alert!-absolutely loved the character development between Hector and his over-the-top wife.-The character of Freddie was less winsome this time around.  He was less convincing and more manipulative.  Brilliant, yes, but without the fun he brought in season 1.-The character of Freddie's wife--wasn't convincing nor was their supposed marriage.  I would have liked to see more of their relationship and what brought them together instead of seeing two people separate who we barely knew were together.-The drama between the foreign affairs chic and the  manager (their previous relationship and trying to find their daughter), it seemed slow and disjointed from the rest of the plot.  HOWEVER, his performance of ocd-breakdown at the end was amazing, hard to watch.A solid BBC production"
80939,"Was amazed , how well it dries the car. I bought two of these one for a gift.Does very well on a Black SUV with chrome. And a Sports Car too. From reading about it ""getting snagged"", I never had that problem. Does the job better than some other more costly ones. I hope this helps."
80940,"Don't like that it's difficult to change the tube.  Sound quality was not what I expected, maybe because I wasn't familiar with the settings.  No power cord was included in mine or manual.  Manual should have been include not sure about the cord.  Dials are very small.  My MIC200 and MIC800 are much better than this.  I can't say it's bad.  Just that there are better choices in my opinion."
80941,I thought it was the movie. Grandkids were not particularly interested in how the movie was made. They are - twins 5 boy and girl. Plus 3 year old girl.
80942,"I originally bought one for my brother who's steps broke (partially).  I thought this would  hold the steps in place for him instead of paying to replace entire step unit.  Well, I decided to purchase one for our camper that we keep in an RV park on the lake we frequent in the warm months (just to protect the steps from future abuse).  WOW, this little thing is easy to tighten up (on any surface) and it makes the step totally stable (almost like you had solid stairs).  I think this will certainly save the life of our steps long term.  Very pleased."
80943,"The OXO Good Grips Snowbrush is built like a tank, extends so far that even the largest windshield is likely to be entirely reachable from one side of the vehicle, and has a brush that can be twisted so the you can easily use it back and forth or up and down.  The only negative, and it is only a slight one, is that this snowbrush is one of the largest I've ever seen, even when the handle is fully retracted.  Although I have owned this only for a short time, it seems to be genuinely well constructed and sturdy enough to hold up heavy use.  Highly recommended (and let it snow)!"
80944,"I love action packed seasons and this season ended on notes where you wanted to watch the next one! I would highly recommend this season to anyone who likes action, some gore, and even romance! :)"
80945,"how will all of the crazy resolve itself?how will the writers bring all of the elements into harmony, without crushing suspension of disbelief?i do truly hope that more are in the pipeline; even a finite number of shows determined at the beginning would be better than for Amazon to let this one go."
80946,It caught my attention immediately... I thought the cast had great chemistry... and story line too... kept me wanting to see more... and good values to the story line... lesson learned..
80947,OMG SPADER rocks glad he is back. This is a good show and I hope it is picked uo and the stories continue to shine.
80948,The seed has a lot of filler.  Not sure it's worth the money.
80949,A great show with nice visuals...I am a science teacher and I even have learned a thing or two from it.
80950,"All you an expect from an Smittybilt product, not the big thing, it works for recovery but don't push it too hard construction material is cheap."
80951,"This is a premium product for those who have a strong desire to car for their leather seats.  Similar to when armor-all first hit the market, this product applies very well.  Although it is pricey, it is designed for true leather seats.  I applied some on my Audi and the shine was brilliant.  It is a bit concentrated so you don't need as much as you probably use with similar products.  Instead of have several care products....Leather, Rubber Trim, Dash Board, etc., this product is designed for many finishes.  So far, so good."
80952,"This is the Only oil I use in my Dyna Street Bob since 2008, Engine runs cooler, Shifts Great, Here in Florida as you all know it gets mighty Hot. This is the only Oil I will ever use in my Bikes."
80953,"I ordered these for a Gibson Songwriter Deluxe EC Custom Vintage and they seem a little bit thinner with slightly smaller heads and a micro-touch longer than the stock pins from Gibson.The pins measure: 28mm -or- 1 1/4"" inches in length.I was going to return them but figured I would try them out in my Gibson Blues King L-00 parlor sized guitar.It was about the same result, a little too thin, smaller heads and slightly longer but I went ahead and tried them.GLAD I DID.I didn't think that after using the Tusq bridge that came stock from Gibson it would make any detectable difference but I was wrong. I CAN tell a slight difference. I did not remove the strings, just loosened them so it was compared to the set that was on it, which were fresh from yesterday.A small amount of improvement in sustain and high end frequencies ringing out was noticeable.They also provide a graph in the packaging info, but I think that it was a test using BOTH the TUSQ pins AND replacement saddle. If you haven't changed your saddle...do it now and get rid of that soft plastic one.I must admit, I did order these with about 75% of ""dressing up"" the guitar in mind, and any amount of tonal improvement would be gladly appreciated but not expected. I got both.White with Paua Dot inlay looks very nice and provides the eye candy I was seeking, although there is no care taken as to ""match the dots"" for consistency, -they will vary in appearance.The TUSQ Pins being a wee bit smaller seem to slide down all the way...right away and need to be pushed all the way into the slot while stringing up the guitar. The heads set flush to the bridge mount compared to the Gibson stock plastic pins that stick up a little higher, and I do wish that the TUSQ pins were the same size.I will see how well they do on the Blues King and most likely will order new pins for the Songwriter Deluxe once they pass the test of time and playing for a month or two. I don't expect them to cause any problems and should provide the extra sustain and ringing that is very much appreciated in any small amount or fashion!If in doubt, consider changing your strings to a brand that might be more suited for the ""tone"" you have in mind, be it darker, brighter, softer, louder, etc. Strings make a big difference and I find using D'Addario phosphor bronze strings very bright & ringy, last long, are affordable, and seem noticeably louder than GHS or Ernie Ball. (steel strings only - does not apply to nylon or gut strings.)Once again, if you have a plastic saddle and/or nut then these pins might not make much of a noticeable difference...then again, they might make all the difference in the world! You just have to try them and see.They are inexpensive and pretty...well worth the risk!"
80954,"We finished season 1 and started season 2 immediately. We are hooked! Not only does the show have great drama, but also some very good undercurrent comedy. We love the sharp wit of the entire full time cast."
80955,"Makes washing and drying much easier much faster, before washing and drying my vehicle was quite tiresome and, now with item, the job becomes fun.This is good."
80956,"Post War!-What everyone who's seen Foyle's War was anxiously awaiting. Triumphant 3 NEW EPISODES of Foyle's Post-War (summer 1945). Done in the same 6-STAR excellence as the British home-front WWII series. Period drama done to perfection providing history, drama, action, romance, mystery, and suspense (6-STARS) in every episode. WITH SUBTITLESProven to be one of the finest war series ever British produced, and this is the result of public demand for more. Foyle returns for some activity after the war. It's just as awesome as the original series.Foyle's War is a classic in it's own time.Michael Kitchen is back as Foyle--the series is impossible without him. Anthony Horowitz is writer/creator. And what a blessing to again see 'Sam', Miss Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks) back helping Foyle in Hastings, solving crimes and dealing with post-war issues. She has such a beautiful face--and more. A jolly voice. I just love her.In the Series, Foyle longs for retirement, away from crime, death, and political intrigue; but now all the world longs for Foyle to be on the job for many series to come.If you watched ""Foyle's War: Series 1-5 -From Dunkirk to VE-Day"" then Set 6 is a MUST. These 3 feature-length episodes do stand alone, but after viewing them you WILL want the complete wartime set. Don't expect to watch one episode at a time. They are so good, you'll watch them back-to-back, all 300 minutes.Foyle's War is fiction, but so authentic and accurate to detail and events that this series is a MUST for historians. it is so historical detailed it becomes educational. Above all else, it is 6-STAR ENTERTAINMENT.Still not enough...check this listing...""We'll Meet Again (4pc) (DVD)"""
80957,"Have used a California Duster for over 15 years on brand new and old car finishes, from black to white. This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.Second, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness. Ya, it may last forever, but I buy a new one once a year - hey it's pretty inexpensive.Be the envy of neighbors, get one of these and be as amazed as they will."
80958,"Love it, I finally found one that supports my 12 strings Alvarez jumbo acoustic guitar"
80959,"""Sara Solves It"" is like combining the dymanic between another brother and sister known as ""Stella and Sam"" (which is Canadian) with another African-American character known as ""Doc McStuffins"". Another thing, Sara and Sam look to be the next Sherlock Holmes and Watson. After all, this series was made for those in Elementary. Plus, unlike some of the other pilots that I have seen, this one is well done. It's already been made from PBS Kids and WGBH, so just think of this program as the preschool version of ""Cyberchase"". And, please be careful using the term 'bully'. You should instead say ""child who lacks in social skills"", like somebody else mentioned. But on top of that, I would have to pick this show to be the next one to start creating."
80960,"Alphas is an original, fascinating show. It delivers strong characters, great stories, and suspense.Hopefully, SYFY will see fit to renew this outstanding show for a third season. Season two was a cliffhanger."
80961,The pilot is well done but I'm not a fan of this genre. Do we really need another show about the chaos at the end of civilization?  Invest your energy in something more positive for humanity.
80962,"This show is too addicting.  I watch at least one episode every night, ans sometimes I stay up until 5am watching this show.  I've learned so much watching this.  The most important thing is that everyone's story is different."
80963,"First let me tell you that the Birdscapes 737 Garden Sip & Seed Feeder is beautiful!  That said I have no idea how long it will stay beautiful as I do not know the quality or corrosion resistance used in constructing the rod iron hanger of this unit. [I know the feeders themselves are made of plastic - but that will last and will not rust].  I don't know if the hanger is just steel (that will rust) that is coated with a brass look-a-like coating that will chip or wear off with exposure to sun and rain in one season.  So time will tell me whether this product will last.  Right now it looks like a million bucks!!!  The only negative thing to say is it is a little balancing act in filling and hanging the water and seed feeders.  Did my best but I did get some water on me and spilled some seeds on my first attempt.  But I can't juggle more than two balls in the air at one time, so I will learn how to fill the units and spill less over time.  Again, my fingers are crossed on the durability of the product.  I bought coated potted plant hangers (that had birds welded on to the hanger and looked great) from Walmart a few years ago and today all that is left of them are pieces of rusty twisted metal that cannot be used to hang anything.  We'll see.  So until time passes and weather does its thing on these feeders I will take a leap of faith and give it 5 stars for being so darn beautiful."
80964,"This little device worked like a charm starting my seeds last winter. I couldn't believe how much quicker it took for them to germinate when using this mat. I put it on a timer with my lights and found it easy to use and setup. It kept a nice warm temperature, never getting too hot. Hopefully it will last for quite awhile as I only get to use it a few weeks a year.UPDATE - Year 2 -Seed mat is working as designed again this year. I need to get another one as I have doubled the amount of seeds I am growing. Definitely recommend this product."
80965,It was well written and very interesting. I liked it a lot and would recommend it.  The ending was a surprise.
80966,I just happened on this series as recommended for me by Amazon. And I'm glad I did. I don't know if their premises are true but the actors really make you believe they are. Worth watching.
80967,"It got four stars because it needs an alert at the beginning that declares the reality it shows.  This is the highly likely scenario of real events.  The quality of filming and the acting is great.  However, it is almost too real for me.  I watch films for escape and entertainment and sometimes for truth.  This is more like a representation of a documentary.  It shows the dark side of humans in disaster.  It shows the compassion and loyalty of friends.  It ends in a reality way which is hard to take.  I probably should have given it five stars.  But that would make it even more real.  So I could only like and not love."
80968,"I have lots of friends who play these strings. Some love them more than any other string, and some are like me. They're clearly good strings, and I love the way they play and feel on my fingertips, but I can't get past the sound. It could just be about how the strings sound on my particular guitars, but in any case, I'm not happy with the sound and that's why I have a hard time giving them a solid five-star rating.I tried these on two separate guitars I play regularly, and wasn't terribly impressed with the sound on either. One is a vintage dreadnought mahogany guitar that normally has excellent tone, and is crisp, clear and fairly loud. These strings softened the tone, which I wasn't looking to do. They sound okay, but nowhere near as good as the Martin SPs I use to really bring out the best in that guitar.I also have a cutaway electric/acoustic I use to sing with because it's fairly quiet, and the softer tones don't drown out my voice. These strings made the guitar even more quiet, and there was a considerable drop-off in tone quality as well. They might have been cheap, old strings, because I couldn't tell that there was anything special about them. This particular guitar didn't have spectacular sound to begin with, and these strings did nothing to improve it. I like strings to either sound as good as other strings, or improve the tone and pull more from the guitar. These strings did neither for me. However, they sound just great when the instrument was plugged through an amp.Based upon my experimentation, I would guess that if you have a great sounding guitar and you're not a fanatic about slight drops in tonal quality, you'll love the way these strings feel and play. I rate them excellent in that category. But for me, tone is 80% of the equation. I'd play wire-wrapped rope if it sounded better than regular strings. In the tonal category, these strings fell short. On a guitar with excellent tone, I noticed a distinct drop in tone quality, and on another softer, more muted guitar, tone quality vanished.In the final analysis, if you're a picker and your guitar can be plugged in, you'll love these strings. If you're really into great acoustic tone and your guitar doesn't have stellar tone to begin with, you might gain some 'playability,' but you will most likely experience a slight drop in tonal quality."
80969,Fun show with good family values.  Lots of stuff to make you laugh.  Just a nice feel good show. Love Phil and the advice he gives his grandkids.
80970,"i love a good rack of ribs on the bbq, this bad boy makes basting so nice and easy, no more burnt knuckles! plus something about mop basting rather than plastic dipping makes a difference, especially if they get smokey."
80971,like other shows picturing people who live and work in dangerous jobsyou must remember there is whole crews in the background that you neversee and everything is made to look more dramatic than it really is.
80972,I've never watched a Nova I didn't enjoy. The best Science program around. I'll be watching Nova again cause it does not get old.
80973,"Bought this for my floral/dried flowers and spice business.The heated mat is the answer for it's ease of growing.My plants for the garden were germinated and on their way ,even when growing season was delayed .I bought two and now have a garden growing mostly from seeds(great seeds available on Amazon)"
80974,"Nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesn't work.  Well,....that's not the case here.  This power supply is well made (durable) and performs to the specs supplied.  I guess a person can take the risk of buying a variable output adaptor with the proper power pin configuration,...but why go to all that trouble?  This product lives up to it's calling.  Besides, who wants to keep changing batteries in the Stobe Tuner (Planet Waves) when this power adaptor is easy to plug in and forget.  I gave it a 5-star rating because the price is fair, the product is well made and works, and it was shipped well within the promised time.  By today's standards, that's as good as it gets.DP"
80975,"It's a quick and easy way to have a battery hook up on your boat, motorcycle, four wheeler, golf cart, just about anything with a battery in it where you might could use a charger, or 12 volt outlet...WM"
80976,"I'm always hesitant to use tire-shine for personal reasons.  They always wear-off and sometimes they are just too shiny.This spray really does the job.  Its non-greasy and shiny.  It makes tires to look BLACK (the fluid is white/cloudy) and as i was applying it to the tires, i could see a difference.  It rained right after i left the carwash and after driving in the rain for 15mins the shine/cleanliness was still there.  So over all i'm super happy with this."
80977,The only thing I've used this on is to polish the spinner on my airplane. It was dull and in need of some shining up. I used a big buffer and it did the trick. It made a big difference. I'd buy it again the next time I need to shine the spinner.
80978,"This was something I HAD to pick up, simply due to the price.  I own a Shure SM57 and compared to this, the sound is very close, not dead on, but I'd consider this over other mics for someone on a budget.The  top does not spin like the Shure and the weight is much lighter due to the material used to cut cost I'm sure, but none the less, it makes no difference sound wise.Overall, a great buy!"
80979,"I was given a Harley Davidson hitch insert for Christmas and didn't want it to be stolen, so I ordered this lock.  It is strong, sturdy, looks good and keeps my hitch insert secure and safe.  The lock even has a cover over it to protect it from the elements.  I am really glad I bought this."
80980,"The hyped-up description of this mess is empty and unfulfilled.  What is delivered is unexplained weirdness which you patiently sit through because you cannot believe there will be NOTHING delivered in the end.  If Ms. Johansson makes a couple more films like this, no one will again trust a film is good just because she is in it."
80981,"This is just the tuner I was looking for! It works on vibration or mic, so it's very versatile. It works on my acoustic, bass, electric, and my mother's voice. Haven't tried the trumpet yet... Intuitive and the back-lit screen is so easy to see!"
80982,"should be a factory part.  covers the gas cap, looks fantastic in my opinion, and it was easy to install with 1 philips head screw driver and 10 minutes of time including watching it done on youtube, since the included sheet of instructions had no words and wasnt really very good.just make sure to watch the video of putting it in and you wont mess anything up like putting the gasket on wrong or something."
80983,I bought these to mount on my tractors snowblower to help with visibility when it is dark out. The tractors lights are okay but don't put out a lot of light. These light up my driveway great when I have to snowblow in the dark. Pretty good for the price.
80984,"So great to see Titus Welliver in a lead role, he's been doing such great work forever. Great dark serial killer show. Better than most of this stuff we see on the air, even if it is a story we've kind of seen before."
80985,"This is one of the best car washes I've ever used.  What surprised me is how great this stuff smells!  It's really a nice touch when washing your car to have such a pleasant odor, no joke.  But the bottom line is that this does a great job of cleaning the car without anything hazardous to your vehicle.  I use this on my Porsche Boxster S and know many other Porsche owners who swear by it for good reason.Cheers"
80986,"These little jack stands are very lightweight, but seem very strong. I had a jack fail on my popup camper and gave these a shot. They work great!"
80987,"I have several Snarks. They are the first tuner my young guitar students have no problems with. Fast and accurate. The SN-8 IS a little faster and slightly more accurate than the other, older models, with a brighter display (at slightly reduced battery life) but they are all great. I have lots of tuners, and several brands of clip ons. This is my favorite. There is no close second. I play 5 string bass in a band and at church as well as guitar. I love this tuner."
80988,"""Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files"" is a series originally aired at ScyFy. It follows a team of people investigating real or perceived paranormal phenomena, from UFOs and ghosts to mermaids and (surprise) the Honey Island Swamp Monster. The team attempts to re-enact various ""paranormal"" scenarios to see if they really lack a mundane explanation. The whole thing reminds me of ""Finding Bigfoot"", but with a broader scope. And yes, the women on this show more skin than the BRFO's tomboy Ranae...Somewhat surprisingly, ""Fact or Faked"" takes a mostly sceptical angle on the problems under investigation. My favourite is the debunking of the bizarre urban legend about ghost children in Texas pushing cars up a slope. The team finds out that even school buses (!) are being ""pushed"" up the slope at the place in question...but unfortunately the whole thing is an optical illusion. It's really a downslope!Another classic is the debunking of ""Dr. Jonathan Reed"", who claims that his Golden Retriever was killed by a crazy alien in the Cascade Mountains. The alien had an obelisk-shaped craft. Reed killed the intruder, took the body to his cabin but lost all evidence during a burglary. Conclusion? About as fake as you can possibly get! I admit that I didn't like the debunking of the poor old Honey Island Swamp Monster, though. I mean, I happen to believe in such stuff. But perhaps there is hope after all, since ""Fact or Faked"" haven't been able to explain the mysterious Nightcrawler of Fresno. But sure, I suppose it could be a hungry shorebird looking for the closest fast food place!Despite the mostly sceptical angle, not everyone is pleased with the paranormal files. Both the CSI and the James Randi Educational Foundation have published a highly critical review of the series. It seems ""Fact or Faked"" don't rule out *all* paranormal phenomena, and occasionally makes a few gaffes. Orb spider, anyone? So while true believers might think an Illuminati plot is behind this one, the sceptical community see it as yet another paranormal ""fifth column"". Pseudo-sceptics fighting pseudo-sceptics? Will the real sceptic please stand up, LOL! As C.S. Lewis would say: ""Really, we are hard to please""...Personally, I think ""Fact or Faked"" is somewhat uneven, with some episodes being pretty boring, while others are more interesting, even intriguing. However, since I want to annoy the CSI this week, I'm willing to oversee the Honey Island debunking and give this series...four stars. How about that?"
80989,These chains are inexpensive. I have so many trees and bushes that I have to buy one of these chains every year but the B&D tool is so handy and easy to use I don't know how I'd get along without it. The chain is easy to install and rejuvenates my pole saw.
80990,"The story line has developed nicely since the scene was set in season 1.  The romance between Gavin (from London, England) and Stacy (from Barry, Wales) has blossomed into marriage.  All the characters have been fleshed out fully.  Each role has been well cast.  Much of the humor plays off the idiosyncrasies of being English versus Welsh.  It's all done in good fun and it's great entertainment."
80991,"I enjoy this show, don't get me wrong, but I'm not sure if I love it yet.  The acting seems, sometimes, a bit subpar.  I enjoy the concept, and it's great to see a reboot of the green arrow.  Also, love seeing deathstroke."
80992,"I love the idea behind this, but it did not hold up well at all. The edges frayed and it started to fall apart quickly."
80993,"I know what the label states, that this is a wash and wax. Friends ---if there is any great lasting wax shine after you wash your car then I have done something wrong. This is avery good car wash and if your vehicle needs waxing then don't expect miracles coming out of this product. I used a paste wax after washing and got good results. That was I believe entirely from the paste wax and not anything left from the washing. The price is very reasonable for this product and it is a five star product."
80994,"Occasionally I like to use my laptop in the car, mostly connected to a wifi hotspot and try to get some work done while my wife drives.  Unfortunately my laptop is a few years old and can only do a few hours on battery, which means I need to plug it in.  Previously I had used 400+ watt inverters, which worked fine, but took up a lot of space, and were quite loud.  This inverter is a lot smaller in terms of capacity, but it offers enough for most laptops out there, it's also near silent.I questioned it being able to fit into a cup holder, not sure that I wanted the power cords all going up to the center of the car instead of a mess of cables on the floor.  Turns out it provides two nice things, one because there is usually a 12V receptacle near the cup holders, this means it has a nice and short cord.  The other is that it fits into the cup holder which means it's not rolling around, it stays nice and secure.  It didn't fit perfectly into our 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix cup holder, not being able to go all the way to the bottom, but still is secure enough.Having 4 USB ports seems a bit overkill, but seeing as how almost everything charges or runs off of usb, it's probably a great thing.  It provides the hard to find 2.1amps (which means you can charge your full size iPads while still powering them), however it is shared across all 4 USB ports.  What this means is that if you have two power hungry retina 10"" iPads you won't be able to charge them both at full speed.  Probably not a concern for most people, and having 2.1amps is great since it is much much faster instead of just staving off an empty battery.The only minor gripe is that with the MacBook Air's wall art (without the extension), it covers up a few of the usb ports.  I would assume this is true of the larger MacBook Pro (and retina) power adapters as well.  It's not a huge deal, if you have a thin usb cable head it might still work, and the ones on the side should still work.  Otherwise just make sure to test fit it and bring the extension if necessary.Overall this is a very compact unit, it's almost dead silent, it provides USB (and 2.1!) charging.  The new generation of laptops are providing enough battery life for a days work and then some, but for everyone else, this is a great way to give yourself a boost on the go."
80995,"In episode #17 (part 1) listen for a bonus at the 2:26 mark, give or take a second.  That being said, Tom Baker's Dr. was the best until the new 2005-present series.  Historically in real time this is a 'post Star Wars' timeline.  Keeping to the look and feel of Dr. Who was getting lost as the 80's progressed but this is still in the good phase of the show's run."
80996,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick, and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result, it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another, which broke due to same issue, but this time was too late to return.  I bought another, more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
80997,"Sorry, but this did not rotate smoothly. It squeeked and chunked around at an uneven rate and just did not work on my relatively new Weber Genesis NG model. I called Weber and they said that each year the models change slightly, perhaps just a few centimeters which may prevent attachments from fitting correctly. The lady's final bit of information: &#34;Things aren't always perfect in the manufacturing process&#34;.  Many people have called attention to that ring &#34;handle&#34; at the end of the rotisserie. I too found it to be a terrible design flaw.You can't grab ahold of it to remove the rotisserie, it's very awkward, and very hot. Sadly, I had to this item."
80998,"It works well, the results is good, In my case the vinyl has some sectors with extra damage becaus of the sun, so the result was not same for the entire piece; shine and looks like new on some sectors but stills look bad on the extra damaged parts.Also the effect in my case is just for some days."
80999,i used it help pull out another car that i couldnt natch out. it was well worth the money an beat having to call a tow truck
81000,"The one thing that has kept us from having a garden at our house is that the wildlife of all sizes would eat it right up, so we would be paying out time and money to feed the critters!This device lets you set up a zone of coverage around your garden so that when it senses the presence of something warm enough to trigger it, it will spray for short period of time and hopefully scare the animal away.This does not require a hose or an electrical line, so you can set it anywhere there is sunlight to charge the battery. You can fill the reservoir with a hose or with a watering can.You can set the sensitivity with a knob - you can also turn it off so you can work in your own garden!you can adjust the spray width - the smaller the better so you don't waste water."
81001,"Although the product says its formula is proprietary, it leans heavily on red and black pepper. I have used these same ingredients to keep cats (off the porch) and squirrels (off the birdhouses) away. I have discovered that, like this, it is sometimes effective. Most animals do not like pepper and will learn to stay away. However, there are some--not many--who do not have the aversion.The one thing I particularly like about this product is that the granular shaker bottle makes it easy to spread the product as well as store it. It's much cheaper to buy red and black pepper, but this is definitely a more convenient solution."
81002,"Lightweight, small, simple to use, and it's easy to read in broad daylight.Can't ask for much more in a tuner."
81003,"Couldn't get into it, it's not the kind of humor I like. It's a little depressing too, I think. I'll pass on this series."
81004,If you never had the chance to get that clean car feel and look in about five minutes then you need to get a bottle of this and go to town! This is the best product I've used in a long time with fantastic results!  Buy it now! Enjoy the look and feel of a just waxed car! Kelly K of Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz
81005,"I have no idea why Griot's Garage products are so expensive. They certainly get the job done, but so do other products from Armor All, Pledge, Windex, etc. The interior cleaning spray is fine, although it's better at light cleaning than intensive tasks like stain removal, which to be fair, it doesn't claim to do. Some people have indicated problems with the leather cleaner, but I haven't had the same issues. I recommend trying it on a small, out of the way spot to see how it reacts with your leather.The best part about this bundle is the microfiber towels that come with it. They're washable and high quality. I'll still be using them long after the Griot's cleaning solution runs out and gets replaced with some equally good, but cheaper substitute."
81006,"I have to admit I bought this roller for installing new formica laminate on our computer desk.  The job was small & this small roller looked perfect for the job!  In addition, if I decide to install more Dynamat, I now have a proper roller to install it with. :)The pros:+ Reasonable price, which included free shipping.+ Solid wood handle for good control, with a heavy rubber roller.The cons:- The shaft ends project out enough to cause damage if it contacts a finished surface. :("
81007,"I've had this for little over a year now, and here's a breakdown of everything I've successfully smoked.Ribs (baby back and spare)Chicken (whole, breasts, wings)BrisketMeatloaf (that's right)Etc....Folks, this is the must have for your backyard.  I'm admittedly a Weber fan boy, but how can you not be.  Well constructed, great warranty, and awesome customer service.  This smoker will take some time to get used to, but once you've got the hang of it, you'll be looking to fire it up every weekend.  Smoke is well distributed, temperature balance is challenging but something you need to learn regardless of what grill you use, and setup is nice and doesn't take a lot of space.Great product for the first time smoker, or the guy that just wants another piece in the yard to add to his grilling arsenal.  Remember though, this isn't a 20 minute grill and done.  You're going low and slow, so make sure you're planning on spending time at home when you get it started."
81008,"Purchased this to keep in my POS winter car which has a weak battery. So, I let the battery go dead to test this until and it worked like a charm. So later in the day I went to the post office and sure enough I left the lights on in the car and I was dead. So this unit has already paid for itself with time it saved me with a easy jump. Its very small and compact."
81009,"Not much to say about this product other than that it is great!This is really an arm and time saver for our leveling jacks. I can't imagine having to hand crank over and over when this socket + drill take a fraction of the time.If you are still doing it by hand, then get this item."
81010,"Loved it! I was on the fence for the majority of this (even with the Heroes and Xfiles cameos) until Aldis Hodge from Leverage showed up. If he was in it I figured it couldn't be too bad. Then the ending... you hooked me Amazon. I'm pretty sure this will end up as some junk Lost storyline; or at best as annoying as Les Revenants but I'm still down for the ride. I hope Amazon continues this season as I,for one, will be watching."
81011,For me the chemistry is gone.  I'm really sad about it too.  This was my very favorite show.  I hope the studio reads this and chooses better scripts. The new FBI storyline is a total snoozer and the personality of the FBI woman is like cardboard. I nearly turned Black Helicopters off before the end.  I'll buy one more episode and if it's boring then I'll stop watching.
81012,"Too light.  Flimsy and just about useless.  Great for new RV/Camper owners that are afraid they'll get their hands dirty while dumping their RV/Camper tanks.  They don't fit well, slide around on your hands."
81013,"This Plant stand is very high quality. The ones locally are usually covered in vinyl and then rust thru and are quite flimsy and cost more. This is a great price for a beautiful stand. I have a mixed planter of annuals that was sitting on the ground by my swing in the back yard although it looked nice this took it up a step.It is very well packed and the hardest thing you will have to do is remove the bubble wrap that is backed by tape on the feet, Had never seen that before. I used scissors but be very careful not to scratch the leg.I would highly recommend these in sets of different heights it gives such a finished look to your garden. I will try to get a picture posted soon that you can view from above."
81014,"Good comedian, the show is creative the way its put together and fun to watch. I imagine it is not for everyones taste, but my wife and I enjoy it and I believe we understand where she is coming from."
81015,They work well. But too over priced. All profit! But they work well. An I can't find these any cheaper? So there you go.  SW
81016,"This 10-inch flower pot holder seems to be well made and sturdy.  It's a tiny bit tedious to put together, because there are 6 screws and nuts, but really after you do it one time, it's unlikely that you will have to do it again.  Plus this designed insures a solid mount with no bending.What I liked was that you can put the slidey bars on two ways for more flexibility.What I didn't like, and which earned the holder the extraction of one-star, was that despite the flexibility previously described, it did not fit my rail.  Really, we have a basic deck.  Rails are 2x2"" risers with 1x4"" flat tops.The solution to this was actually easy and consisted of taking the screws out and moving the sliding bar to the top, rather than on the bottom of the bar attached to the wire frame.  That way it pokes out a little bit past the ring, but works perfectly.Since there's a fix that will make this plant holder fit almost any rail, I don't have any problem recommending it."
81017,"I didn't give it 5 because paint is easy to chip even after curing. I've used G2 caliper paint before and honestly, this stuff won't even come close to matching durability of G2.Only problem with G2 is you cannot save paint (turns rock solid in several hours), so it has to be thrown away. However, Dupli-color caliper kit can be stored away and used later on."
81018,"I have enjoyed this series as the premise is very relevant.  Everything we own, practically, runs on electricity--what do you do when the power runs out????  People turn on one another, the good vs bad is really addressed passionately.  Only one character, Tom, is getting tiresome as as the writers have him switching sides so frequently.Normally I DVR programs and wait to fast forward through the lengtly commercials but this program I do try and catch the broadcast."
81019,"I wouldn't recommend tuning these strings to E however, because the intense amount of tension it takes to tune these to E can cause permanent damage to the neck that not even the truss rod can fix. The highest I feel comfortable tuning these to is E flat. If you are doing anything at or below Drop C sharp, these strings will work out great for you."
81020,"I purchased this exact model from my local ""Wal-Mart"" and actually paid more than I would have here, but I needed some clippers and fast.First off, they are not rigid at all..  What I mean is, as long as you are clipping a few blades of grass, you are ok, but really put it to use, and you soon find that it will lock blades and not function. This is due to the very poor construction.  Too much ""slop"" between the blades often make either both blades lock together or separate so much that nothing is cut.If you really want a good set of clippers that actually work, look further as this is a ""novelty"" item more than an actual functioning tool."
81021,"John Goodman played my favorite character of all time, Walter Sobchak, so this pilot caught my attention above some of the others. Unfortunately, it's not very funny. It just seems to be a lot of ""Aren't Republicans dumb? Isn't that funny how dumb they are?"" jokes. I'm not partisan at all but funny is funny, and this wasn't."
81022,"OK, so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything, depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However, I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw, folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
81023,White Collar is one of the best shows on TV.  Matt Bomer and Tim DeKay are so awesome together!!  They really make you feel for their characters and have me laughing all the time.  They rock!!
81024,"Well cast drama quite accurately depicted. Don't believe,however, Jonathan Rhys Meyers would ever be mistaken as a double for the original Henry VIII! Nor would any of the real wives and children be as glamorous as the ones Hollywood chose. But the action, the sets, the activities, the costumes, the political-religious arenas of the day were all so true to life that we must grant Hollywood some leeway. All in all, it was a marvelous portrayal of 15th-16th century England. More such dramas should be presented on TV."
81025,"I love Bones, but had gotten a season behind and I loved being able to buy the seasons and get caught up!  Such a great show!"
81026,"I wanted a decent black hitch cover to use as a base to mount a skull head to something sturdier than what it originally came on. This is a nice well made plain hitch cover so whether you want something plain in itself or something plain to work from, this is a great hitch cover. I highly recommend this product."
81027,"I use Mobil 1 oil on my bike and in my cars, Mobil 1 grease for bearings and Mobil 1 gear oil for diffs and the shaft drive of my FJR.  It's high quality stuff and worth the price."
81028,They have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that don`t know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by D Addario get some real picks like Dunlop Tortex
81029,I have been watching this show long enough to know that Chumlee is a good shot. He should compete in tournaments.
81030,"Love the premise of this storyline.  Two cities that are close to each other with those from wealth and the tenants to the Squire and landlord.  It revolves around the postoffice where Dorcas is mistress and cousin to one of the tenants in Lark Rise.  Candleford is where the postoffice is located and as a favor to her cousin, Dorcas takes on Laura Timmons, the eldest daughter.  Twists and turns revolve around the love interest between Dorcas and Timothy the Squire (who is married to some else).  Then there is William, the starch, stern religous man who is a mail carrier and Zilla the house maid (who looks older then dirt and is set in her ways as well).  Much fun, romance and underlying polotics take you and a fun-filled journey in Lark Rise to Candleford."
81031,"This is a nice little tuner. It is small, easy to read and use. It has a non-backlit LCD display of an analog VU style meter, with extra marks at plus and minus 20 cents, and red LEDs that light when a tone is sharp or flat. It has a green LED and large mark for being on target. It has a built-in mic for acoustic instruments, and a mono 1/4 inch phone jack for electric instruments. It has an active tone you can switch on for tuning, but that is only adjustable over the narrow range of 410-480hz. It uses a pair of AAA size batteries that you pop the whole case open to change. If you have any vision problems, the display might be an issue. The LCD is about 1 1/2 inches long and 3/4 of an inch high, and, like all non-backlit LCD displays, has a narrow viewing angle and reflection issues.I wanted this for tuning didgeridus that I was making, and it works adequately for that. The one thing it is lacking that disappointed me is a frequency or octave readout. As it is, it gives you the note and cents sharp or flat, but does not give an octave number or frequency of the sound. So, you know you are tuned to a C, you just don't know exactly which C it is. Probably not much of an issue if you are tuning a regular instrument, but in some cases would be very handy to know. I suppose with more training and experience, I could learn to tell that by ear. (What? Learn a skill! Isn't that asking a bit much?)I suppose for an inexpensive tuner, that is the trade-off, but it does detract from the usefulness of this tuner for my purposes. Other than that, it seems to work well. It is consistent, easy to use, and compact. I consider it about average in value - it does the basics well but is missing what I consider an important function in such a device. I may be expecting too much for the price, as I have not done an exhaustive study of tuners and their specs. Having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of three.In any case, if you don't need to know the actual octave or frequency but just the accuracy of the notes you are tuning, this works quite well, and is not very expensive."
81032,The Multi-Tow Adapter is needed to supply multiple trailer use.
81033,"The plots are always believable, interesting, and dramatic//superb cast who does a fine job// hard to believethis terrific work is on American TV. NBC has threatened not to air it next season//there are 12 new episodescoming. Thank God for Amazon.Com so I can see both entire seasons--the one past, and the upcoming season.VERY SOPHISTICATED//SHOWS NEW EQUIPMENT FOR CATCHING CRIMINALS."
81034,This cable expands the capability of the One-Spot or Godlyke 9V adapter. The quality is very good and the length between plugs is more than adequate for most pedal boards.
81035,"I watch and enjoy a lot of BBC mysteries, Zen was a refreshing change of scenery and actors. A little mystery, intrigue and relationship drama goes a long way for this series. Well acted, and good story lines keep you guessing until the end of each episode."
81036,A great start for the show that is adult in humor and has an interesting story and great potential to shine.
81037,Man this show rocks can't stop watching it full of twists and turns. Plus I grow up in the 80s and lingo I remember
81038,"I got a kick out of it. The cocky astronaut, the 50's space alien setup, and the humour. It isn't on a par with some of the other animation movies out there, but it is nowhere near being really bad. I was somewhat shocked at the people who hated it, but then there is no accounting for tastes. Cute, non-offensive, but still gently skewers the 'you are different from me' mentality. Overall, a solid 4 for animation quality, gentle skewers, and amenability."
81039,"I tried this in front, in the middle, and at the end of an effects chain, as well as by itself, plugged into the effects loop of my Mesa Boogie Mark V amplifier.  Whenever it is in the path, as soon as I engage my effects loop, the signal level drops considerably.  It did not matter whether the pedal was on or not.  The chorus effect is good, but I don't want my volume to drop every time I turn on my effects loop.  I have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that I use, so I can't raise the send any more."
81040,"This is really beautiful but . . . the hummingbirds are still going for my hour-glass-shaped, red plastic feeder with the bright yellow feeding stations. Exclusively. It's been about 2 weeks now, and they don't seem to recognize this as a feeder at all.I also wonder if the metal base could potentially burn them if left in the sun---but that is just guessing. Ideally, you don't want the feeder in the sun anyway.If things change and they suddenly flock to it, I'll update the post, but sadly I can't recommended it right now. If you do buy one, make sure you have a very sturdy cord to hang it (it does not come with one), because it's heavy and the last thing you'll need during barefoot summertime is broken glass on your deck.  Happy humming!"
81041,"I am one who pampers my cars.  I am very familiar with Lexol products, having seen them at various car shows.  I was looking for something to compare against my regular brand, which is Maguire.  The product is pretty sraight-forward and easy to apply.  My only critique is the application nozzle, prevents a full stream, but on the other hand I could be using it incorrectly.The product presents a high quality finish and doesn't run like so many shines.  In other words, when you drive a good portion of the product finds it way on the exterior of your car (near the tires) because it doesn't dry evenly.The product is a good option for those looking for an alternative or those who are loyal to branding, since Lexol is known for premium exterior car care."
81042,"For myself, these might work? Only because my car is very small and barely weighs 1800lbs. These are not solid, they are a thinner plastic, maybe 1/4 of an inch thick. They do however stack together nicely to make it easier to store them. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone, not even a Go-cart racer.When I seen RhinoGear I imagined thick sturdy rubber chock-blocks not thin plastic cups."
81043,Makes rinsing out the black tank a breeze. Used to just run a hose and hoped it got everything flushed out. This can be aimed around the holding tank to get a better rinse of residue that is left over from empting the black tank.
81044,"A show that prey- I mean plays upon many of Stephen King's wondrous imaginationary creations? Whether subtle or overt or twisted a bit more? It just gets better in the second season, whatwith mysteries piling on each other, and each secret revealed more tantalizing than the one before, but with the price of more questions popping up. As well as shocking things that happen to jolt you back.The Troubles are still getting confused, but so is the mystery of the man with the tattoo, and Audrey's connection to Haven, Maine, and, most especially, her own childhood.Unlike Stephen King's stories, however, this show doesn't need graphic language nor excessive violence, nor even heavy sex scenes to prove itself worthy of attention. It proves its worth all its own, and does it thoroughly."
81045,I loved all 3 seasons of Veronica. This one leaves you a bit hanging. Excited for the movie. Hoping it will wrap everything all up
81046,my brothers dog ate the harness of my bike while I had it stored temporary at his place. I am glad to have found replacement on amazon for an affordable price.
81047,"This film is an odd amalgam of two people, a teacher who recently lost his wife and a successful writer of supernatural stories, falling in love amidst a background of dead or soon-to-be-dead people and ghosts.  I especially loved the background piano music which created a kind of  mood of living as best you can with the knowledge that death is inevitable for all of us.  Aidan Quinn plays a boorish married suitor of Lena, the writer, and provides a counterbalance to the quiet, dignified Michael, who's just trying to raise his two children and look after his ailing, depressed father-in-law. The Irish town where this was filmed was quite lovely and added to the somber mood. It was a ghost story without all the usual cheap tricks.  I liked it."
81048,"The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-4 Slap Echo effects pedal works great and gives me that Old Tube Amp Reverb sound that you would only expect from a more expensive unit.  There's no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the sound you want with no effort at all..  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
81049,"I bought this pedal new, hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage.  I knew going in that it would not sound like a Martin D-28, but I thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars.Imagine my profound disappointment.Really, Boss??? This is by far the worst pedal I have ever used of yours.  This thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the ""Top"" control higher than about 9 o'clock.  At first I thought I must have a defective unit, but then I started reading reviews on-line.  Seems like it is part of the design. It's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones, hidden beneath a wall of fizz. Totally unusable, as far as I'm concerned. By the way, I tested it direct to a PA as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar (strat)."
81050,"Love this show due to Castle and Beckett love affair, also love how Castle has a connection with his daughter.  Great that Ryan and Jennie are going to have a baby, wonder how that going to play out."
81051,This strap button works great. works so much better than the string around the neck thing.And looks better too!
81052,"Bridget Kelly and Siobhan (prounounced Shi-bon) Martin may be identical twins, but they couldn't be more different.  While Siobhan leads an upscale lifestyle as the glamorous wife of a wealthy man, Bridget is a recovering drug addict and witness to a recent murder.  But when Bridget discovers that Siobhan has gone missing in an apparent drowning, Bridget steps into her glamorous shoes as an escape from her own flailing life.  But one thing the two sisters do have in common is secrets that run deep and significant resourcefulness.So, admittedly, the premise is a bit difficult to swallow, but that doesn't mean it isn't intriguing to watch.  This show has so many twists and turns, that the viewer is taken on a rollercoaster ride where you never see the next drop coming.  And it's a heck of a fun ride!"
81053,"I was not expecting it to be as large or bulky as it is, but it is solidly built and works wellfor charging the small electronic devices that I need it for. Perfect size for charging cell phone, camera battery, laptop, tablet etc.I would recommend this product."
81054,"This was so well acted.  Romantic, heart wrenching, funny, incredible sets and costumes, wonderful adaptation of Dickens' book.  This is a must see."
81055,Very pleased with this set of tools.  I've had many sets of barbeque tools.  These seem to be among the best of them. Very sturdy and comfortable grip.  Will see how they hold up over time.
81056,this is a wounderful bottle of washing soap for your car or truck or van or just about anything as it makes the vehicale look better and yet brighter and it shows that you care about your vehicale enough to keep it clean as its a investment and is worth the cash to buy this soap and will give you a shiney and clean look and i highly recommend this soap to everyone and all my friends and employees and family thank you...
81057,Currently have used them for 6 months with no issues.  Purchase to charge two jet skis in boathouse.  Working great. also purched two 12 ft extensions
81058,"A little on the expensive side for something made in China.  For this price, it should be made in the USA.  Good product otherwise."
81059,"Updating my review to add a star because, although the trap isn't very fast, it will alert you of an infestation in seldom used storage. Kept inside a confined area near a door you can check periodically, you'll know you have a problem that you can seek out and address before it gets too out of hand. The only caveat is that you'll need to replace according to the label or you'll have a false sense of security. This is not the best solution by a long shot (if you deal with lots of wool, scrupulously freezing, baking, or tightly sealing any incoming fiber is far more effective).Original review:I used this trap in a confined, sealed closet with a known moth population. Tested it inside the closet for a several days before I bombed it, and used others outside the closet to monitor jailbreaks.Because the traps only catch males, they don't work as a treatment, but theoretically, they should attract any male moths and alert you to a potential problem before it gets out of hand. If the traps had a highly effective catch rate, any males would get trapped before mating and that would be the end of that.Unfortunately, however, judging by the low volume attracted to the trap inside the closet--and the amount of time it took to attract *any* moths, I don't feel confident that this trap will be a good advance warning for a moth problem or mating preventative. It seems so weak that you might need a significant infestation to even alert you--and of course, by the time you have moths, the damage to your fiber has already occurred (adult moths don't feed; the caterpillars are responsible for the damage).I typically keep all wool sealed and segregated, and freeze or bake any incoming wool from unknown sources, but some outside yarn got tossed in a closet, and I ended up with moths. I tossed all the yarn and fiber in the closet to be safe (my real supply and personal stash are both stored in completely different parts of the building), but it gave me the opportunity to test out these traps.I'm still giving them 2 stars because they will catch moths eventually. I think they'd be useful monitoring a highly confined, infrequently-used space with low-value wool, stuff you wouldn't mind tossing, but I wouldn't rely on them for keeping your nice stuff safe. I also tried the other brand sold on Amazon. It was more effective, but still only in 3-star to 3.5-star territory.BTW, if you want to make sure any seemingly unaffected clothes are moth free (the eggs are really tiny, and even the larvae are small enough to miss), you can freeze or bake them. In a lab setting, all stages of clothes moth are killed at less than 10 minutes at 128F (30 min at 120) or 24 hours below 0, so I bake everything in a hot car in the summer sun for several hours--over 130, according to my oven thermometer--or deep freeze for a week or two. I figure the overkill will make sure the temperature penetrates through the fabric/fiber."
81060,"I used this on a 1993 Lexus with 135,000 miles.It had problems shifting into over drive with a 4 speed auto transmission.In less than 100 miles after replacing 3 qt`s transmission fluid and 8 oz`s Lubeguard (1 oz.for every qt your transmission holds) it shifts smoothly once again."
81061,Excellent stomp box. You can dial it right in to get that SRV sound. Very sturdy and very well made. A must have for any blues player.
81062,"Great acting, engaging story with plenty of intrigue. I had read positive reviews and it did not dissapoint. I reccommend"
81063,"I use this all the time to get coals out of my Weber Smokey Mountain or my older Weber Kettle.  It works well and is well made.  If you want to save money, just wait for the coals to go out overnight and then use a plastic 1/2 gallon milk jug with the bottom cut out.  That's what I used for years until I received this as a gift.  Much better way to go."
81064,I want to give this series 3.75.. I found the series by accident. I'm glad I did. There is intrigue around every corner- it has a Canadian feel to the film quality
81065,"Good filter which is better than Fram, Stp or other lower end filters out there.  There are good comprehensive filter reviews at [...].  I am not sure how well the additional filtration actually helps but it's only a dollar more for the pureone product."
81066,"Damian Lewis plays a good part.. I enjoyed most of the story lines not to heavy, and no bad language..such a nice feature."
81067,"These cables work very well at transmitting sound. So why only three stars? Well, these are far from the most well thought out instrument cables you will find. These are stiff, thick, and heavy. While that's good for most analog cables, these cables are so stiff and heavy that, for instance, a portable tuner or a small stomp box might easily be moved around just by having one end of this cable in there.With so many amps having plastic jacks these days, you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might be putting your amp jacks and pickguard-mounted output jacks under if these cables can fling a tuner around just by being plugged into one. I mean, let's face it. You never know what will happen at a gig. Sometimes you're playing with a 12 foot cable when you should have a 18 foot cable. A cable shouldn't come out because of a gentle pull, but if it's between the cable falling out and it moving a bass head around or you tripping on it, you want the cable to fall out. If everything you have is heavy or Velcro'd to the ground, this isn't a problem, but it is for me. I feel like when you're playing with these cables, you're worried about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out, but because it's seriously like a trip wire out there.Lastly, these plugs are huge. That's not really a problem if you play a Strat or a Tele, but what about a P-Bass or a J-Bass where the plug comes out at a right angle from the body? This is going to stick out a lot, and to loop it around your strap, it's going to be a huge, stiff, cumbersome loop. I know people often buy 90 degree plugs for those kinds of instruments, but most normal straight plugs do just fine. So yeah, if you like to move around on stage, get more flexible cables. You'll thank me.These cables are just poorly thought out. They'd work great as patch cords, or keyboards, drum machines, from pedal board to amp (as long as you have a metal jack). Monster has a cable that costs half as much but works twice as well for actual instrument use, and at that price, Pro Co cables are also excellent, and they have brand name plugs, as well."
81068,"This pedal work, although I find it a little bit cumbersome in my particular setup. My issue is really only one of cable routing though and will be remedied soon enough. The M195 does perform as it is suspend to although it does play word with my delay pedal, even running the delay on the output side of the M195. The noise gate is quiet and smooth an would be vital to many with a high gain setup. I run mine in my pedal chain for my bass rig, when using fuzz and distortion."
81069,he is a strong serious actor..... look at his role in the closer.....she is cast as superwoman.....  but she is tooooo cutethe computer guy is simply toooo wierd.......
81070,"This was cute, and funny, and smarter than I'd expected.  I hope the premise of the show--that she improves her life--holds over romantic entanglements.  Kelly is a likable character."
81071,I love British television and this to me is as good as it gets. There is never a bad episode. The characters are so realistic I feel like I know them. They don't come any better than Judi Dench.
81072,"These things are awesome.  I bought two along with some relays and relay sockets so I could get them enough power directly from the battery to do serious audible damage.  Make sure to buy this one with its mate, the 72102 high tone.  After wiring in the relays, these went in my 2000 Civic perfectly.  They replaced the crappy horn in there, and I used the wiring to tie into the relay signal hot wire.  Then, I grounded the relay to the body by tying it into the ground wire from one of the horns.  The horns come with these little wire slide connectors that you can clamp onto your wires.  I used wire nuts to tie all the wires together - I suggest you do the same.  I was able to mount them facing away from eachother with grounding connectors in between the mounts using a single bolt that held the old Honda horn.  This was ideal, and very clean - no drilling required!I suggest finding yourself a 12V DC 4-pin or 5-pin 40 Amp SPST ISO Micro Relay for this project.  Also, it really helps to have a 5-Pin Wire Harness Relay Socket.  This will give you all the wires you need directly from the relay.  These are really cheap items, and you shouldn't have trouble finding them.  The 4-pin relays work fine with the 5-pin sockets.  Then, educate yourself on how relays work, and wire that bad boy up!  I got my relay and relay socket on ebay.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.  Buy it now if you want to be heard on the highway."
81073,Does the job well enough
81074,"We like to grow vegetables inside when its cold. Its fun for the kids and it ensures we have fresh veggies on hand.As with any plant when you've got one you really like or just want to grow more and not wait for seeds you clone it. This product worked great for the assortment of veggies and fruit that we tried it on. In little to no time at all we were in business with roots all over the place.So if  its a house plant, a flower, fruit or veggie and you want to clone it then pick up some of this stuff you'll be glad you did."
81075,pilot is great. I am a huge Stephen king fan and he sid an amazing job on this show. would love him to remake some of his others with modern special effects
81076,"bought this for my CRV originally. now still works with my Honda Pilot. has lasted 5+ years and still going strong. holds the front weight of the car easily. just line it up right and drive slowly up the ramp. it can take a beating and is very hard plastic.i can change my own oil now easily and for dirt cheap yet high quality.extremely satisfied. would highly recommend. (if you are tight on a budget just park half on a curb and it should give enough space underneath, but this lets you do it in your own garage in a much nicer fashion)ADDITIONAL ITEMS TO HAVE WHEN CHANGING OIL:- a couple jack stands (i always use this as a backup as never good to have a car fall on you)- 4 tire chocks to prevent rear tires from moving by accident (always use parking brake as well)- socket wrench (walmart extendable one is solid)- oil and oil filter- gloves and lots of newspaper to prevent oil messes (definitely will be some)- oil pan (walmart has a solid large one. the bigger the better. should have built in spout)- about 1 hr of time... drive it around a bit first to warm up oil so it flows faster, careful as it will be hot)- channellock tongue and groove plier in case you need help to remove the oil filter (it is crazy tight initially but doesn't have to be)"
81077,This unit looks and works like the original.It fit easily into the filter guide and I really don't see a need to spend any more money on  a OEM unit.And yes this is an easy do it yourself installation.
81078,"I own three packs, one for each of my cars. They work as advertised and have never failed me. Clore makes quality booster packs. I have used all 3 numerous times and have also used the packs to power tire inflators. I own one that has the built in inflator. It also works as well as the 660. I am happy they have added the battery charge indicator light. Its easier to know when you have gotten to the full charge and you cannot overcharge the newer style units. The unit simply cannot be overcharged. The ones without the charge light make you rely on the specs for proper charge time. The gauge is good but you cannot be 100% sure you are at full charge unless its a newer style unit."
81079,"Really makes you stop and think what if this really did happen in our world what would you do.  Very interesting, has the since of community in it."
81080,"Love the series.. Comedy, and drama, all rolled into one. and Ms Mc Donnell definately out shines her "" Dances with Wolves"" What a beauitiful and talented change"
81081,If you ride a trail this is a must. Very easy to use and install. This is one of the best that I have used. Very little if any vibration while riding. Well worth the money.
81082,"This stuff is amazing.  I bought it when RP was running a special; buy the oil, get the RP filter for free.  I was very surprised at how much difference it made over regular oil.  My engine runs a lot smoother and quieter.  I will be buying again.  Next time I think I will buy the high mileage version.  I just hope RP has another special so I don't have to pay for the matching RP filter $$.Update:  After a little over 4 months and 5,000 miles I changed my RP oil.  It looked almost as good as new oil; just a little browner.  When I had tried to do the same with house oil from the parts store it was shockingly dark; almost black.  RP has earned a life-long convert and RP evangelist."
81083,I love the learning aspect of this show.  You can see some really neat things from our history and learn about them. However the staging of the show is a little poor quality. Maybe it's just that ordinary people can't act. But they try!
81084,"These are great.  I was concerned the 7-inch size would be too much with stock tires, but they are perfect.  They give my jeep a new look and take years off the body.  Easy installation, but I will warn you, if you have the stock bolts, do yourself a favor and spend the $20 or so bucks on the hardware kit advertised on Amazon as it will save you a ton of time.  As for these fenders, perfect fit to the OEM holes and what a difference!  A simple ratchet and box end wrench were all the tools needed (and of course the small work-shop rolling seat I got on Amazon makes the job comfortable because you really need to be able to sit-down to do this job)."
81085,"This stuff can save the day when you have a flat. I dont want to spend time at the side of the road, and I dont like hearing in the news of people dying being hit by cars when trying to change a tire. I dont care how good you are at doing it, its going to take some time, and time is not on your side when texting drivers are passing by you at seventy mph.I just squirt some in and use my portable tire inflator to get me home or to a tire shop and deal with it there. Easy to connect and just squeeze.This is cheap insurance"
81086,"""Klondike"" is a six part miniseries that aired on the Discovery Channel over three nights. From executive producer Ridley Scott, I had very high hopes that ""Klondike"" would be the must-see dramatic event of the television season. I have heard many people completely dismiss the program due to factual errors and/or inaccuracies. These complaints are, perhaps, more valid since this appeared on the Discovery Channel which is not known for scripted programming but for documentary-like productions (in fact, this was touted as their first scripted miniseries endeavor). I, as a casual viewer, was not particularly bothered about the precise factual details presented but was willing to accept this as a purely fictional entertainment loosely based on real life events. So that is how I am judging ""Klondike."" As the series begins, I thought that there was enormous potential in the storyline and I really enjoyed the set-up. For me, though, the longer the show progressed, the less I liked it. There are plenty of good elements (notably the filming location and several strong performances), but I found the plotting and characters to be very inconsistent--almost maddeningly so.As the series opens, we meet our intrepid hero Bill Haskell (Game of Throne's Richard Madden) as he and his best friend (an effective Augustus Prew) decide to embark on an adventure to make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. Near the turn of the century (late 1890's), they join the fray of fortune hunters exploring the uncharted Yukon Territory. As they make their way across the vast wilderness, the scenery is impressive and ""Klondike"" is absolutely captivating. Eventually, they reach their destination and face challenges that are both unforeseen and somewhat nefarious. This is an untamed country and the settlement exists in a survival-of-the-fittest mode (think Deadwood with less grit, believability, or expletives). I was all-in on the first two hours of ""Klondike"" despite its flaws because I wanted to see what was going to transpire. A devastating event rocks Madden's world and his existence turns to finding justice in an outlaw land.In my opinion, it is this development (no spoilers here) that largely derails ""Klondike."" Instead of being a grittily realistic depiction of a harsh life, the series seems to want to hedge its bets by adding a mystery component as well as the requisite romance. The remaining four hours have Madden playing amateur sleuth as opposed to focusing on the gold rush elements that should have been central to the plot. It's a big miscalculation, because Madden is supposed to be our entry point into this world. Many of the supporting players are ill defined, even great actors end up in one dimensional portrayals. Tim Roth (who can do no wrong in my book) gets a showy role as a villain, and while it may be fun, it lacks any real depth. Sam Shepherd plays the local clergy, but it never feels particularly integral to the plot. Abbie Cornish is, perhaps, the show's second lead and she can be quite good. Although the screenplay puts her into some soapy situations, she is one of three characters that get real development. I also liked Tim Blake Nelson, who ends up working with Madden.In the end, nothing about ""Klondike"" really gelled for me. The Yukon Gold Rush is such a great setting for a compelling story. But this mix of fact and fiction really never capitalized on the potential. ""Klondike"" does look great, but it left me emotionally disconnected. If it was half the running time, I might have enjoyed it more. But in six parts, there is just no reason why the characters couldn't be developed more adequately. I wanted to love ""Klondike,"" but I just wearied of it and never felt that the time commitment had the dramatic pay-off that I was looking for. KGHarris, 3/14."
81087,My 4 year old loves this show.  She learns about animals and giggles most of the time.  What more could a parent want.
81088,"i think everyone does a fine job here but i've frequently read what really makes a good drama is having a great villain.  one of the all time tv great villains has to be Boyd Crowder played by Walter Goggins.  I saw him play the screw up cop on THE SHIELD for years and little did I expect he would have the dramatic chops to make a great villain.  I loved the time he found religion and then lost it.  I've loved his love affair and planned marriage to Ada.  His visits to her in prison in Season Five are priceless. Oh, and when he waxes poetic with his southern drawl and story telling ability, that's the very best.  He and the writers have given this villain nuances that are just genius.i really like timothy O as the marshall too.  i enjoyed him on DEADWOOD prior to this.  he is the hero with a bit of bad boy in him.  but he always ends up doing mostly what's right except for his own personal life. and this season he even has a child albeit living in a different city.  I agree with another reviewer here who likens him to early Clint Eastwood.It is a marvelous show with marvelous writing, all inspired by a short story by the late Elmore Leonard who also wrote the novel &#34;Raylan&#34; shortly before his death about the marshall.but it is still Boyd who makes it for me week in and week out."
81089,One of my all time favorite programs.  This one... there are other productions.  Just a wonderful story and  wonderfully acted.
81090,These lamps have many uses in car lighting applications and are just plug and play and really cheap as most LEDs are.
81091,"I was very taken with this movie.  A young Chinese orphan girl is profoundly grateful to her long-time Australian sponsor for providing the funds to give her a decent life.  The sponsor, a lonely, depressed, and withdrawn prison inmate, gets a new chance at life after encountering the girl whose life he has transformed.  I was touched by the story and found it inspiring.  Some of the criticisms laid out in the reviews here may have merit, but these problems didn't ruin the film for me at all.  Glad I watched it."
81092,I liked it. I just hope it doesn't  go on and on like &#34;Lost&#34; did. I liked the storyline but think it would get dull after awhile. I would watch one season and hope it had an ending.
81093,"This show has always had a nice premise.But, the constant attempts to be witty, funny and dramatic regularly (constantly?) get in the way of good television and keep the show from being really interesting."
81094,These came pre gapped and were very easy to start threading even in those ridiculously hard to access rear cylinders on my wife's 2009 tahoe.  Everything fired right up and sounds/runs great.  No complaints.
81095,If you have one of the millions of GM pick ups with the base mirrors these are a reasonable add on for towing.  They are easy to install after some practice.  Easy to remove - not sure why some other reviewers had problems with this...  Just unscrew the clamp and slide them off.  They are a little tough to adjust because you need to move the mirror beyond where you want it and let it snap back a bit. Just takes a little time.  Once adjusted they stayed put. They are stable on the highway but on bumpy roads they cause my OEM mirror glass to vibrate more than the add ons.  This is probably due to the extra weight of these.  You will definitely want to take them off when you are not towing.  They make your truck look like Dumbo and people will bump them in parking lots.  Best price by far was Amazon when I bought them.
81096,"I take off my own trash.  Unfortunately that has attracted some creature that gets on the back of my truck bed very often and tears open my garbage.  I'm really not sure if it was a cat or a raccoon.  It was a smart little creature, because I set cage traps and it would always manage to turn the trap over to get the food out but not get caught.  I thought it might be a racoon or a cat.  I used this thinking it might be a stray cat.Here's what I did - I pressure washed the entire truck, bed and all, then I parked it someplace else for 3 nights.  I sprayed it with Dog and Cat-B-GON and so far, it has kept the critter off my truck and out of my trash completely for a bit over couple of weeks.  I can't say for SURE that it was this product that helped, or if it was my other preventative measures.It's convenient to just spray the truck and bag when I put the trash in the back of the truck.  I've not had ONE ripped open bag.  I do know the feral cats are still out there at night- I've seen them.My other problem was my own cats getting on TOP of my greenhouse.  I sprayed all around the greenhouse and around the top.  However, the cats are STILL getting up there.  It's like they don't notice it.Long story short - it's very easy and convenient to use, and I think it works sometimes - but it might be working for raccoons and not cats. It doesn't work all the time though - I know that for a fact."
81097,"I have a fully-weighted 88-key Alesis QS 8.1 and an M-Audio Axiom 61 semi-weighted and they're both fine when I'm just playing standalone or recording audio or MIDI. But I wanted something with a lighter touch for entering notation and experimenting with soft synth sounds, when my focus is more on writing and software than on playing, per se. The Alesis is perfect: I can grab keys effortlessly without feeling distracted by playing the keyboard 'correctly' - if that makes sense (it makes a clear difference to me).I opted for the 25 key strictly for space considerations and, while the down/up octave shift keys are easy and intuitive to use, I often wish I'd gone for a larger model to get wider voicings. I may trade it in for an upgrade at some point, but overall I'm very happy with the keyboard."
81098,"Fine actors, interesting idea; who the hell knows. I woould watch for a bit if only for the interesting orchestra aspect."
81099,I love and loved this show.  It was so cheap of FOX and/CBS to cancel this show.  The Unit was the only military serial show I have ever gotten into mostly because the missions were such a huge part of the show and the family life a side dish  I don't think more seasons will ever be made and that is unfortunate.
81100,"Good grip, but too flexible, and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks. Probably good for strumming, but not good for lead."
81101,I was taught to use tide to wash my car as it left a shine and stripped old wax . I bought this and it is suppose to protect wax . I also use the spray wax after . Very pleased and this will provide enough suds for 16 washes almost a summer season . The add on price now can't be beat . I live on a dirt road so I must wash my car this cleans it so I can keep a nice coat of spray wax on it . Then I can hose it off on rainy days when the road has mud . In dry times I use a original Ca Duster to whipe it down to the wax and it looks like I just detailed it . You need a clean car to put wax down and this  does it for  about 30 cents a wash . I use turtle Ice spray wax 470r a synthetic and then Ice Paste . For about half the price of one wax job I am set for almost a season because here in winter you must go to a  indoor pro wash period and make sure you pay for the underside spray with rust inhibitor . God Bless and good luck .
81102,"Although I've been a homeowner for nearly eight years, I've never had a mouse problem... until now.This winter, mice decided to take up residence in my garage. And while theVictor M265 Kill & Seal Mouse Trapsdid a commendable job, I decided I wasn't going to mess around anymore.After reading the reviews here, I decided to skip the bundled no-name batteries and go with some decent alkalines, and since my mice seem to enjoy peanut butter, I put tiny little bits on the steps. Another dab of peanut butter inside (JIF creamy seems to be irresistible) was all I needed before flipping the switch.Because I didn't really know the scope of my mouse problem, I opted to put the Multi-Kill in a relatively open space near one of the corners in the garage. It was good enough to lure two in to the Kill & Seal traps, so I thought I'd give it a try before moving boxes that mice may have turned in to condos.The next morning, my trap was blinking like a Ghostbusters trap. The zapping area? Clean as a whistle... except for that peanut butter. The mouse's last meal is definitely not a filling one. In the bucket, it looked like two fluffy mice decided to take a nap. Even the bucket was free of droppings or liquid. In fact, it was almost unnerving how peaceful it seemed. This probably won't satiate you, if you want some sort of mouse vengeance kill-dozer.The only thing I really have on my wishlist for this item, is for the bucket to pop out with a bit less force. It takes a fair amount of effort, and I have a feeling that when it's closer to the capacity of 10 mice, their fluffy little corpses could go flying if you're not careful. Other than that, though, I think this trap is pretty awesome, and don't mind a bit that it cost this much."
81103,"I really didn't expect this guitar strap to be anything more than what it is. It's tight knit nylon with leather to attach to the strap posts, It's not a super fancy top of the line guitar strap, but it serves it's purpose well. feels sturdy enough and it's adjustable for a man of any size. I ordered it on the 20th and received it on the 23rd, no complaints here. If you are like me and do not feel that it is necessary to spend 20$ or 30$ on a guitar strap then this would suit you just fine, for 6$ you can't beat it. buy one or 2 nothing to lose here"
81104,"This is a little different this season, with the group having to deal with actual thinking &#34;bad guys&#34;. Makes the plot more interesting and who thinks up this stuff??? 2 slaves without jaws and arms as a defense tactic. Twisted!"
81105,"This season sure has been a roller coaster ride!  Sort if like 3 seasons in one. I have to hand it to the creative team though because through it all the characters have all remained consistent. It's one if the few shows where you don't yell at the screen saying ""but he would never say that!"" Or ""she would never do that!""  In any case the ending of the Red John storyline was very satisfying. Personally I would have enjoyed seeing Patrick on the island more but that's just because I like the way he looked in that episode. But Simon Baker looks good even in the worst situations so it's all good. I've never been a shipper for Jane and Lisbon but I bought into it finally in the finale. Part of the reason I got the whole season is I wanted to watch all the episodes again leading to the finale so I could watch Jane's realization about her come to light."
81106,Replacing air filters are so easy to do that even a neanderthal could do it. Why pay them big bucks?
81107,something new and cool to wash
81108,I have tons of picks and these are well made and easy for me to hold in my hand without slipping around too much.
81109,"Excellent portrayal of an aging lawman struggling with modern society and younger competition. Well written, and for the most part well acted."
81110,"Francesca Annis especially was simply the wrong choice to play Tuppence. She looks more than 40 years old, rather than a young 20-something woman. Her partner, whose name I can't remember at the moment, was also too old. It made the shows leaden and ridiculous rather than light and fun."
81111,"I knew very little about the Viking era when I started watching the show, but I am finding it enthralling, and it has prompted me to start reading up on the history of the Vikings--always a sure indicator of my interest. The writing is intriguing, and the Viking world they have created is fascinating. Ragnar, the central character, is both a man of action and a thinker, and the supporting cast are all equally compelling. Ragnar starts as a farmer with a navigational secret that will transform his world and launch Viking exploration of civilizations that were shut off from outside interference for centuries and will never be the same again, nor will his own society remain unchanged!"
81112,"No one could fault the production values. But this movie is confusing as hell. Character decisions, conversations and plot points appear incoherently, without enough explanation or exposition or motivation. It's often hard to tell where things are happening, where people are, why they're there, who they're talking about ... All a disjointed mess. Jet Li does a good job playing a confusing character, though."
81113,This was a really good episode of Doctor Who. It was surprising and infrmitive and action packed. No spoilers here but really if you have not seen this one do. It will make you want more Doctor Who.
81114,"Along the line of Fringe, People dealing with the impossible. The interaction between the principals in the show are emotionally challenging. I enjoy this show"
81115,"Worked fine in snow, one of the cable connectors bent back causing one cross cable to come loose.  Pinched it back together with heavy pliers and it was fine.  New cars and trucks are getting finicky about bulky chains which would normally be my preference for heavy use."
81116,"You would expect a thinking creature who has lived hundreds of years would be smart enough to use it's accumulated knowledge to do something to make the world a better place.  Plus also use it's knowledge to enrich itself, make it's existence more comfortable.  The writers for this series have added dimensions to ""Dracula"" that have never been explored before, and it is enriching the viewing experience.  The multiple layers of story lines and the new twists to a much seen tale make this a ""Must See"" series for all of us who love a good vampire story and all of us who enjoy television shows for thinking adults.  None of the episodes have been ""Dummied"" down for the 6 year old to 14 year old viewer!  YEA!  We have had some problems with the channel Dracula plays on and it has been getting  lot's of static (Sun Spots the TV repair man says) so I am paying to Amazon see this show - and it's worth every penny! the only draw back is that I can only watch this particular show on my computer.  The provider does not allow Amazon users to play it on their television sets."

81118,I like this show because of how real it is. you follow the detectives on each case from start to end. the city of Indianapolis has the most solved murder cases in the United States. I wouldn't recommend watching if you have a sensitive stomach.
81119,"I really enjoyed this highly creative series with all of its many unexpected twists and turns. Don't know why they didn't make a Season 2, but sadly that often happens when I like a show."
81120,"The Walking Dead is on the very shortlist of shows I follow on a regular basis. Undead, gore, grimness aside, TWD combines excellent writing, acting, production to form a genuinely outstanding experience. It's worth the time and money to follow it from a reliable source like Amazon Instant Video."
81121,Great hook!  Supports a lot of weight.  Looks good on any wall.I would highly recommend this hook to anyone for any application.
81122,"I really enjoy this show the way Raydor talks but the Lt Provenza is a hoot.  I would venture to guess he is what makes this show connect --before and NOW.  Him and Flynn really work well off each other the toa, S&aacute;nchez, buzz the ensemble cast is what makes this a great show.  Do not care for the new member but if you could replace her with David's love ex love interest, the accountant forensic then it will be complete."
81123,"Refreshingly nihilistic and amoral, this classic MTV animated series from the 1990s represented a truly wonderful break from the saccharine pap we're usually fed. It offered us a take on high school life light years away from the idealised vision to be found in so many shows. What we have here is considerably closer to the brutal - and just plain stupid - reality. What's more, ""Daria"" is a show that manages to pull all this off with a dry, rapier wit, and its own tersely ironic sense of style.I know that five star reviews tend to predominate here on Amazon. So much so that it becomes almost a running joke. I think that's because according to Amazon's stated guidelines, five stars simply means ""I love it!"", and most folks tend to review what they love. But in all honesty, this really is an extraordinarily good piece of animation. One well worthy of five stars by just about any criteria.As  is the case with any TV show transferred to other formats, it needs to be acknowledged that there are really two issues here: the show itself and the transfer. As most readers will already know, with Daria the big issue with the transfer was always going to be the music. Because the original show sampled from so many popular artists, a full and faithful reproduction on a non-bootlegged release was always going to be a copyright impossibility. In the end, virtually none of the original background music survived.Given this reality, for the most part I take off my hat to the musicians who did end up providing the substitute background music for the DVD. They took on what was always going to be a thankless task and for the most part acquitted themselves pretty well. True, there are moments here and there where the music they provide is noticeably weaker than what we heard in the TV original. But overall they do a fairly solid job. Personally, what I miss most is not the lost background music per se, but the varied and eclectic range of songs used as end title music in the original broadcasts. These often provided an ironic or poignant counterpoint to the themes explored in the episode.Now for the show itself. In my opinion, the first two seasons really do see Daria at her best. I don't think this season (season two) is quite as good as the first, but it is very close. Hereafter... things begin to go downhill. Slowly and intermittently at first, but by progressively greater leaps and bounds. The most marked change is that Daria the sardonic observer of human folly is replaced by Daria the moral crusader. The show's dry edge isn't entirely lost, but it is substantially dulled.Curiously, the season two opener is an episode called ""Arts 'n' Crass"" where Daria and Jane collaborate on an artistic work that is then horrendously sanitized by school administrators. I can't help but wonder if the irony here is deliberate: if there was at least someone behind the scenes who fully grasped what was being done to the show, and felt the urge to give voice to this protest. If so, the protest is remarkably clever and doubly ironic, because how Daria and Jane handle the situation that has been thrust upon them fits seamlessly in with the show's new direction. A direction that is ultimately spelled out quite plainly in all its awfulness at the other end of the season, in the final episode ""Write Where it Hurts"". That one really does rather ominously show us the way of things to come.Fortunately, the episodes between these two bookends are for the most part in the spirit of season one. It is for this reason that I'm still able to give this season five stars. Things don't really descend into full blown sermonising until season three. So for true diehard fans of the show's original vision, this is your final chance to bask in the light of that vision (dare I say, ""the harsh light of reality""?) before the coming of the dark times.Enjoy it while it lasts!Theo."
81124,"This was a little difficult to put together for me with my disabilities. But I did it! I wish it had two lights. I tried to start seeds with it, but they do better in my Aero Garden . I'm hopingIt will be enough to keep my pepper and tomato plants going until spring. The replacement bulbs are not all the same, so be careful that you get at least what you got with it. I'm still trying to find some that are affordable and will do the job."
81125,"Seems very entertaining some interesting twists however I would suggest this get wrapped up in no more than 2 seasons otherwise it will continue to , every time one question gets answered 2 more will be asked, like Lost. When Lost was on I loved it  but it ran to long at the end I just wanted it over. That being said I did enjoy the show held my interest through out well worth a watch"
81126,"I purchased this because I was tired of using those 'stick-style' pressure gauges, I never felt those gave an accurate reading since over time it seems that it became easier for those sticks to shoot out.In any case, this is a good gauge. It's got a good ergonomic feel which may or may not be important to you since you're generally not using it that long anyways. Clear digital display and a mini light. You can also program the gauge to set a target pressure for your front and rear tires which is a nice feature. The packaging claims that the battery is lifetime, I somehow doubt this, but it appears there is a screw on the backside that should give you access to the battery. I've never had to replace it yet anyways. Overall, a very good digital gauge for measuring your tire pressure."
81127,"A murder mystery based on a real case involving the wealthy Durst family (changed to ""Marks"" in the movie), which made its name by buying up New York rural real estate cheap, becoming slum landlords when it evolved into the Times Square area of Manhattan.  I watched this primarily because Frank Langella, one of my favorites, played the cold, workaholic father in it, but the acting in general is excellent.  It's a tawdry story that makes you feel bad for the mentally unbalanced Durst son David, who was traumatized by watching his mother commit suicide as a child and may or may not have killed his wife.  The film certainly strongly implies that.That said, I hope the missing Katie is alive and well after a successful career as a doctor and enjoying her retirement somewhere safe, although it's a lot more likely that she's long dead.  She and her working class Long Island family were the only decent people in this story."
81128,"This is as much a reply to the guy who wants to hear from people who have had this for more than a week as it is a review for prospective buyers. I've used it for 8 months with no issues at all. It sounds great, it works perfectly and it was $40. As for quality control, I have several Joyo pedals, and I can say they all work perfectly and sound awesome. I've never used a Phase 90, so the ""clone"" factor was a moot point when I purchased the Joyo Vintage Phaser. It works, it's simple to use and I had money left over to buy more gear. I've been playing for 29 years and I highly recommend Joyo pedals. If you don't like it, get a refund. It's not rocket surgery."
81129,"I had the chance to try these out. I have had a number of traps lately and comparing them all together these are one of my favorites. i like the simplicty of the old fashioned trap with the spring bar. There is little room to fail, it either works or it doesn't. Other traps I've tried include some that spin, some that are reusable and don't kill the critter, and still others that caught the mouse from the top in a weird way that never really worked right.These traps are simple, they are NOT as sensitive as some of the other basic traps but they are still sensitive enough. If you put loose bait on the trap you might not get your critter. I would recommend putting peanut butter as others have suggested as it will &#34;stick&#34; to the trap and require a little more movement of the trap plate to get it to trigger.These traps work, they are cheaper and reusable then the fancy &#34;spin&#34; style traps and frankly these are all you need. I have them set out around the garage."
81130,"This program is full of wonderfully absurd possibilities.  If you just give it a try, you will become as addicted to it as I am."
81131,"I love this show. Always makes me laugh. I need a drag queen friend. Any takers? Lol I live in Vegas you think I could have one! But anyways, has everything I love, comedy, beauty, make up, fashion, drama. I will always be a huge fan of rupaul and her drag race. &#60;3"
81132,"Well, Iike the feeder, easy to clean and hang, but the birds really like it much better than my more traditional one that's like an upside down jar and that's what matters, they like it. I think I'll get another, but I like the traditional one as it's hanging in a window, but still, the birds like this one better."
